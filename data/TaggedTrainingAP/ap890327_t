 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have reached agreement in principle for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to pay compensation for the 37 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sailors killed aboard the frigate Stark in a May, 1987 Iraqi missile attack in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, sources said Monday. The compensation package still needs the formal approval of both governments, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Progress on the stalled claim request was made when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation, led by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> legal adviser <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, went to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> last week. The talks ended Monday and <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> was headed back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. In their talks, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> teams apparently `` are reaching the final stages of achieving a substantial settlement on the claims,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. She said she did not know when the actual agreement would be concluded and could not divulge details of its content. At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, defense sources said an agreement had been reached but they described the accord as `` tentative _ subject to review back here in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> presented <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> with a $ 29.6 million claim for the families of 37 crewmembers who died on the guided missile frigate Stark when an Iraqi jet fighter fired two French-made Exocet missiles at the ship. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claimed the missile attack was a mistake born of the tensions of the Iran-Iraq war. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claim was presented 11 months ago but <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> rejected the amount, which includes $ 800,000 for each of the families. The defense sources, who insisted on anonymity, said they could not discuss the dollar amount in the agreement or how it might be divided among the families of those who were killed; the sailors who were injured; and as settlement toward the cost of repairing the Stark. `` But apparently our negotiators are recommending we settle for a bit less than we were originally asking with the goal of ending further delays in settling the issue,'' one source said. In addition to the $ 29.6 million sought for the families of the 37 dead sailors, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has asked <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to pay $ 82.9 million to cover the cost of repairing the Stark and returning it to active duty with the fleet. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials have refused to say how much they asked <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to pay to sailors who suffered injuries but survived the attack.

 Outgoing baseball Commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> is discussing a purchase of strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> learned Monday. Meanwhile, a judge ordered a hearing on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s attempts to force its pilots back to work, and sources said former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is among those being considered to head the carrier's reorganization. An offer from <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> may be presented to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors within the next few days, airline industry and baseball sources said on condition of anonymity. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>, contacted for comment at his <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> home, said, `` I've heard about it. But we just do n't comment on rumors.'' <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> said his company would have no comment on the matter. `` There are a lot of those rumors going around,'' <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> said. `` If and when any agreement is reached to sell Eastern I'm sure all the parties involved will issue a statement.'' <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, contacted in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said the commissioner did not wish to comment on the matter. A source said the deal would involve <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> businessman who is a friend of <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s and is majority owner of <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, who headed the host committee for the 1984 <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Olympics, is to step down as baseball commissioner on Saturday A call to <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>'s office seeking comment Monday night was not answered. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s board is holding a regularly scheduled meeting Tuesday and Wednesday, said a source close to the company. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> was approached last fall by officials of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions to consider taking over the troubled airline, which filed for bankruptcy protection March 9, five days after the start of the Machinists' strike supported by airline pilots The Machinists and pilots unions have said they would make concessions if <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> took over, possibly in return for ownership of part of the airline. A call to the Machinists local in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> was not answered Monday night. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> met with Eastern officials during baseball's winter meetings in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last December, then traveled to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for further talks, a baseball source said. In addition, <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> have discussed a possible buyout with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> set a hearing Thursday on a key issue tossed back to him by an appeals court. The appellate court said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> must decide if the pilots are merely honoring <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union picket lines legally, or if they are trying to advance their own cause with their walkout, which could violate the National Railway Labor Act. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has backed the full hearing, denying their strike is illegal. In refusing to cross the picket line, <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> `` certainly considered our parallel interests to strengthen our position to obtain our own collective bargaining interests,'' said pilots' attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Linsey </PERSON> `` There is nothing wrong with that.'' Eastern proceeded on another front against the pilots Monday, inaugurating its first six-week training class to replace pilots who walked out with Machinists on March 4. While the carrier had planned to begin training up to 50 replacement pilots Monday, the class size ended up smaller than that. `` We cut back to 35,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>, adding that all the new hires had impressive qualifications. The carrier said many are pilots from other carriers hoping to bump up their seniority by jumping to Eastern. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Trustee <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who is administering <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorginization in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said Monday he is considering about a dozen candidates for examiner in the complex case. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who declined to name names, said the ideal examiner would be `` someone who can play the role of statesman.'' Sources who spoke under condition of anonymity told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the list includes <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and top securities fraud lawyer <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said he hopes to decide by late this week or early nex week, and will recommend that person to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> has said he would appoint an examiner with sweeping powers to try to mediate the bitter dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and its unions. The examiner also will review financial transactions between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, a Washington-based securities lawyer who represented some claimants in <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s Chapter 11 proceeding starting in August 1982, also is one of the lead defense attorneys for imprisoned insider trader <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is now vice chairman and managing director of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an investment banking firm in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> D.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s secretary said he was unavailable to comment. <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> said he was n't aware he was on the list.

<TEXT>
 It's Academy Awards time again, the glamour, the glitz and the ballyhoo. But Oscar can easily be upstaged by the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> sideshows sharing the bill. Who's wearing what and with whom _ the evening's Five Ws _ have been known to steal the show from the golden statuettes that come later, as arriving celebrities ritualistically alight from their black limos. On the party scene, the Academy's official Governor's Ball is generally a staid affair and Oscar winners usually make only obligatory appearances before heading to private parties. But this year, many stars will party while watching the awards on television. `` It is very fashionable this year to say, ` I'm not going to the Oscars,''' said celebrity insider <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, who is also a public relations consultant for <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> hair stylist <PERSON> Umberto </PERSON>. Superagent <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> `` Swifty'' <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON> will throw his annual Oscar soiree at the posh eatery <ORGANIZATION> Spago </ORGANIZATION>, with dozens of celebrities expected to gather there to watch the awards on television. Those expected include <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON>, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>. The city's No. 1 celebrity of late, former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, turned down an invitation to <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON>'s party to watch the awards with wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, at their <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> home, said spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>. Actress <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> will hold a private get-together to watch the Oscars show, and <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tova </PERSON> <PERSON> Borgnine </PERSON> will cast mock ballots with friends during a private party in their <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home. Other mockers will gather at the Palace club in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, the scene of the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raspberry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>'s annual Oscar spoof ceremony, which this year will be held simultaneously with the Academy Awards. Guests will dine on a potluck dinner while viewing the real Oscar show on a large-screen TV. Presentation of the plastic `` Razzie'' trophies, which honor the worst in entertainment, will be made during commercial breaks. The Oscars ceremony may not be the only game in town Wednesday, but it could be the most expensive. A complete Academy Awards evening can range from $ 1,800 to $ 15,000 per person. A seat at the Shrine Auditorium ceremony costs $ 150, the Governor's Ball runs $ 450, it's $ 500 for a stretch-limousine, tuxedo rental is about $ 70 and designer gowns range from $ 1,200 to $ 12,000. Producer <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, who hired designers <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Klausen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON> to spiff up the Oscar show, said the awards will be big, glitzy and nostalgic, more like a Broadway play than the annual parade to the podium. `` The trend this year will be drop-dead chic entrance gowns,'' said <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON>. `` The idea this year is a return to great glamour, the Hollywood of the past. The public looks to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> for glamour.'' He promised `` a lot of wonderful beading'' on the gowns. Two celebrities can particularly be expected to have the drop-dead look. <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> can usually be counted on to expose her navel, and actress-model <PERSON> Edy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> habitually steps out of a limousine wearing not much of anything.

<HEAD>NRA Loads Up as Gun Issue Heats Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, traditional heart, soul and bankroll of the nation's gun lobby, is digging in for a test of its vaunted political power amid rising pressure to curb sales of assault weapons. `` When less than half the convicted felons ever spend a day in jail, why should we be taking firearms away from law-abiding people?'' declares <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, federal affairs director for the 118-year old <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>. Demands for restrictions on military-style, semiautomatic firearms are escalating, however, in the aftermath of the <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, schoolyard tragedy Jan. 17 in which a deranged gunman with an assault rifle left five youngsters dead and 30 other persons injured. So intense is the clamor that, as often as the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> has crushed or blunted gun control bills in the past, many doubt that it can prevail this time with its strategy of blaming the murder wave sweeping cocaine-ridden communities not on firearms but `` our crumbling criminal justice system.'' `` We're certainly going to try,'' says lobbyist <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. Even Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., who urged Democrats to softpedal the gun issue after the 1988 election, says public opinion is ripe for action on semiautomatics `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> is stubbing its toe here,'' he says. `` The appearance of being unwilling to deal with assault rifles has hurt them.'' From its modern headquarters on <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a few blocks from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> deploys lobbyists to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and statehouses across the nation, provides generous campaign contributions to its political friends and generates tons of literature to fill the mailboxes of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s gun enthusiasts With annual revenues of $ 70 million and a staff of 365 employees, including 65 in its lobbying department, the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> is well equipped to fight its political battles. It also has powerful friends. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a member. And its roots go deep in the fabric of American life. Founded in 1871 by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officers, the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> has long counted many military men and policemen among its members. It holds firearms courses for police, private security firms and private citizens. It is recognized by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic Committee as the national governing body of shooting sports in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and maintains a junior program for youngsters. It also provides self-defense courses for women and maintains a 1,100-piece gun museum within its headquarters as well as a special, `` Muzzleloaders'' division within its membership for history buffs. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> got the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to shelve a proposed seven-day waiting period for would-be gun buyers. Failure of the bill named for former presidential spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, brain damaged in the 1981 attempt on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, spurred <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s wife to urge readers in full-page magazine ads to help `` break the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s death grip on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The real secret of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s power has long been its ability to mobilize hundreds of thousands of gun owners across the nation to write and telephone lawmakers. `` Please open immediately. Legislative alert,'' trumpets a mailing that went to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> gun owners in February. It warns of an impending bill in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> in which `` the anti-gunners ... have launched an all-out attack on semiautomatic firearms in line with their goal of banning all firearms.'' `` Your immediate action is needed to defeat this dangerous bill,'' it says. But the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> nevertheless approved the measure calling for a background check of would-be gun buyers. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lawmakers are expected to pass a more stringent measure and bills are pending in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. A number of cities, including <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, also have approved restrictions on semiautomatic weapons. And on Sunday, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> announced its opposition to the public sale and distribution of the guns. The chain reaction has led to a further question of <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> power. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> is being forced increasingly to the fringes of this debate,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Garen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wintemute </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who treated AK-47 assault rifle wounds as a doctor in a <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> jungle hospital in 1981. On coming home, he was shocked to find the same AK-47 wounds in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` More and more people are willing to come out and say, the emperor has no clothes, meaning the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>,'' says the doctor, who has become an outspoken critic of assault-rifle sales. Others are more skeptical about the alleged erosion of <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> power. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> members have n't lost anything with me,'' declares Rep. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkmer </PERSON>, D-Mo. Few if any <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members take a dimmer view of gun control. Pending bills aimed at military-style assault weapons also would `` take away my Browning shotgun and my thirty-ought-six deer rifle,'' says <PERSON> Volkmer </PERSON>. `` I think we can kill that up here. I think we can beat it.'' What happens in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will depend heavily on the view from the hustings. Democrats say a blizzard of <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> mailings against 1988 presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were probably not decisive. But they hurt, especially in states where gun owners are plentiful. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> political consultant <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> says the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stand in favor of toughened gun control `` was n't the No. 1 issue'' in his state `` but as part of a package of issues that subjected him to attack from the other side, it played a very important role. `` The Republicans used gun control advertising very heavily, so obviously their polling showed that it was an important issue,'' he says. But on Capitol Hill, a stream of gun-control bills is flowing into the hopper, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Fortney </PERSON> -LRB- Pete -RRB- Stark, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., and an array of other Californians The most heavily spotlighted bill, however, is being offered by Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>. It would place certain semiautomatics, such as the AK-47 and the Israeli-made Uzi, in the same restricted-sales category with fully automatic machine guns. It also would allow the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to put additional semiautomatics in the same class. Private citizens may own machine guns but only if they are fingerprinted, pay a $ 200 fee, undergo an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background check and get permission from their local law enforcement officials. This has not deterred all firearms fans. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> NRA member, declares that he would hate to part with the .50 - caliber machine gun that is the centerpiece of his Why does he want it? `` What does anyone pay $ 150,000 for a Ferrari? Why does anyone want a Matisse?'' <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> muses. His company makes a sinister-looking round-drummed, semiautomatic shotgun called the Striker, which pumps out 12 rounds of 12-gauge shot in three seconds. The weapon, designed by a Rhodesian farmer to chase off rebels, is precisely what <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> wants to outlaw.

 Whether they're from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, they all seem to speak the same language: the language of the refugee. The voice and the picture of the world's 14 million political refugees _ of whom it has been calculated that only three of every 100 ever return to their homeland _ is brought home in a newly published photo book. The book, `` Forced Out,'' represents an unusual collaboration by four publishing houses and a foundation in an attempt to inspire a global movement on behalf of the human rights of refugees, often unwanted guests in unwelcoming camps. It consists largely of accounts by refugees of the sometimes bewildering, frightening or hopeless twists their lives took once they were forced from their homelands. To a world inured to political disaster, the voices sound familiar. A Salvadoran, describing how the National Guard conscripts boys from a sleeping village: `` No one could run that night, maybe because the boys were still half asleep. ` They are only going for a year,' the members of the patrol would say to make us feel better, ` and they'll be more civilized when we send them back. In the barracks they learn to read and mind their manners,' they went on, without looking at anyone, addressing the stones that were us. The year was up but they never came back. No one comes back.'' An Ethiopian, resettled in <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>: `` Arriving in the area of settlement we were scared to death. You feel lost. ... Never had we seen such thick forest, inhabited only by wild animals, snakes and big, biting flies. Homeland was a beautiful place, full of grazing cattle. My dreams are still bound to my homeland.'' An Afghan looking for a new home: `` We were deported from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on March 29. They next day <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> took us to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and then to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> refused us and sent us back to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The Koreans then sent us to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and told the Sri Lankan authorities that we should be sent on to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Sri Lankan government refused to accept us ... so <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> took us to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>.'' A Salvadoran: `` If we speak out, they kill us. If we're suspected of speaking out, they disappear us And if we keep our mouths shut, they think we're hiding something. So they kill us for that too.'' In one painful paragraph, a famous <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> doctor, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON>, describes how the body starves: `` Nature becomes kinder to the starving at this juncture, kinder than the politicians arguing about boundaries and power. A great overpowering lethargy develops, and a kind and wise nature offers large doses of sleep to ease the pain of slow death. In the meantime the body proteins have been depleted, the water and electrolyte balance destroyed. The abdomen becomes distended with fluids, the extremities swollen with water, and now the degeneration of the vital organs such as the liver and the kidneys starts in earnest ...'' A Vietnamese boat person describes the desperation of the starving: `` Our food and water ran out. No ship rescued us. ` Please wait until tomorrow. I'll die. Then you'll eat me,' said <PERSON> Dao </PERSON> <PERSON> Huo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuong </PERSON>. Three of us pulled <PERSON> Cuong </PERSON> out of the cabin and held his head in water. Then one of us butchered him. Four others helped. We cooked the meat in boiling water. I remember we prayed to the Lord before we killed Mr. <PERSON> Cuong </PERSON>.'' Principal author <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Kismaric </PERSON> says political rather than natural disasters create most refugees and most are forced from their homes by their own governments, either for supporting rival factions or so that their land can be seized. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frelick </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugees </ORGANIZATION>, in an essay on how countries accept or reject refugees, writes, `` Refugees are inconvenient. Their concern is not for order, systems or bureaucracies, nor for the general welfare. Their concern, rather, is for survival _ their own and that of their families. `` Governments, on the other hand, have competing concerns: the sovereignty of borders, relations with neighboring countries, controlling immigration, promoting ruling ideologies, placating public opinion. If offering asylum to a refugee is consonant with those concerns, a government might come to his aid.'' `` Forced Out,'' a collection of photographs and first-person accounts refugees, was commissioned by the <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fund </PERSON>, supporter of <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors the conditions of refugees. It was published in a collaboration by <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> W.W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Penguin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, with profits earmarked for the Human Rights Fund.

 A tiny, pale aqua egg was found in the nest box of a pair of nearly extinct <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo. The egg, measuring 5 inches long, 3 inches in circumference and weighing about 10 ounces, was spotted early Easter Sunday morning. Zoo workers took the egg to an incubator while the parents, <LOCATION> Cuyama </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Cachuma </PERSON>, a pair of 6-year-olds, were away from the nest. `` What an Easter egg!,'' said zoo spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>. `` If fertile, God willing, it will hatch in 54 to 58 days.'' The pair had an egg last month that proved to be infertile. Zoo officials also took that egg away for artificial incubation in hopes that <PERSON> Cachuma </PERSON> would `` double clutch'' or lay a second egg. `` We have high hopes for this egg because since the time of the last one they have definitely improved their -LRB- mating -RRB- technique,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> said. `` It's a big egg, a nice egg. It looks good but we wo n't know for sure for another week.'' She added that there were no cracks in the shell. In the wild, the massive birds with a 9 -LCB- - foot wing span would normally lay one egg every other year, Ms. <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> said <PERSON> Molloko </PERSON> is the only <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor chick conceived in captivity. The bird was born last April and stays in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> Wild Animal Park. There are only 28 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors left in the world. Fourteen of them are in the Wild Animal Park and 14 at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo.

 For years, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has urged, threatened and cajoled the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to allow free emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But now that thousands of Soviets are being let out, many are finding the doors to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> closed. Some 19,000 Soviets are waiting to be interviewed at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for permission to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as refugees; another 7,000 are waiting in temporary quarters near <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures. The steadily growing backlog appears to result from several factors: poor planning by the administration, severe budget restraints and a change in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s refugee policy. `` Now that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has chosen to let these people go, we must not fail them,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., who has sponsored one of several proposed funding bills to ease the emergency Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>, R-Wis., co-sponsor of another emergency funding proposal, warned that `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies could change overnight We have to take advantage of this moment.'' Soviet applicants have been told their processing could take as long as two years and have been advised not to quit jobs or tell landlords they plan to leave for fear of finding themselves without work or housing. Last fall the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asked Soviet authorities to withhold exit permits until some of the backlog can be cleared, Jewish community officials say. At the current rate of Soviet applications _ about 4,000 a month _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will run out of allocated refugee slots by April or May. In January, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> shifted 7,000 unused slots meant for Vietnamese refugees to accommodate the Soviet overflow. Revised estimates project some 40,000 Soviet applicants this year, about 20,000 more than was budgeted for by the administration. The crisis has been compounded by a change in <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> policy, which no longer grants automatic refugee status to every person seeking to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In the past, all Soviet Jews, who account for the majority of Soviet emigres, were presumed to have a `` well founded fear of persecution'' and therefore were considered refugees. Jews were subjected to government-backed anti-Semitism, prevented from studying Hebrew or practicing their religion and denied permission to leave. In 1984, the low point of Jewish emigration, only 896 Jews were let out. A directive issued last summer by former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to determine refugee status for Soviets on a case-by-case basis rather than as a group, in keeping with the way <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> laws are applied for other refugee applicants. This has resulted in denials for as many as 70 percent of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> applicants for refugee status, according to a just-released report by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The report found a 50 percent reversal rate on appeal by those denied, evidence of `` uneven standards and inconsistencies among INS officers.'' The report faulted <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> inspectors for, in many cases, not speaking Russian and not knowing about life in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In some cases, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> processors were brought to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> from duty along the U.S.-Mexican border and applied the same standards to Soviet applicants as to Mexicans, the report said. Those denied refugee status are being offered parolee status, which does not provide government funding nor does it allow the recipients to eventually apply for citizenship. `` This sends a message to the Soviet government that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> no longer views Jews and other minorities as persecuted people,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> representative of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> which lobbies for Soviet Jewish immigration. `` It's a strange political statement as a time when the administration has decided to keep up its pressure on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to comply with international human rights standards,'' he said. The administration, caught in a squeeze, is scrambling to respond. The White House is preparing an emergency request to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for $ 100 million to help process and resettle the flood of emigrants. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has prepared legislation that would allow as many as 30,000 people to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> annually if the president declares it in the best foreign policy interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Unlike refugees, though, these people would not be given government funding. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is conducting an internal review of the problem in preparation for consultations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on increasing the number of refugees allowed into the country. Meanwhile, more <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officers are being sent to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to help hasten the processing, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> told a congressional hearing that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> could not have foreseen the surge of Soviet applicants when it budgeted last year for this fiscal year. But members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and Jewish community groups are accusing the administration of deliberately misleading them. `` The administration's refugee program is phony,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., head of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on foreign operations `` This was not unpredictable in light of last year's growing emigration trends,'' he told <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Obey accused the administration of presenting deliberately low predictions in order to stay within the limits of the budget, knowing it could obtain emergency funding later on to respond to the humanitarian crisis. Jewish groups contend the low figures are part of an administration attempt to shift the funding for refugee programs increasingly to private groups. Currently, the American Jewish community provides about $ 2 to $ 3 for every government dollar spent on refugee admissions and resettlement and it has launched a $ 75 million fund-raising campaign to provide for the flood of emigres.

<TEXT>
 A feud is smoldering between two world institutions based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with billions of dollars to lend and the power to make deeply indebted countries tighten their belts. The disagreement between the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> centers around the division of work between them. Which should be telling governments to devalue their currencies? Which should require cuts in government spending? Which should look at long-term problems? How long is long-term? The 151 governments that own the bank and the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, which get together every spring and fall, start meetings in the coming week. Their ministers of finance and central bankers will have a lot to say about the debt of Third World countries, now over $ 1.2 trillion. What the two organizations can do about it depends on clearing up just what their roles should be, or even whether they should be merged. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> has put out some new ideas on how to reduce the debt, but critics are saying they may be too little and too late. Other governments are expected to suggest doing more. Before the meetings open, President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> of the bank, a former congressman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and Managing Director <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> of the fund, a Frenchman, are trying to agree on how to cooperate. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and nine other leading governments have asked <PERSON> Lamberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Dini </PERSON>, the No. 2 at the Italian government's central bank, to report on improving the relations between the twin institutions `` If they do n't get their act together, there's going to be more pressure to merge them,'' said <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergsten </PERSON>, who heads the private <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>. `` That would be a mistake, because they would only have to be separated again after a few years.'' <PERSON> Bergsten </PERSON> used to be in charge of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with them as assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> for international affairs. Both organizations are linked to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, but they have something it lacks: teeth. By giving or holding back loans and by the conditions they set, they can sometimes make or break governments. Their conditions can lead to violence. Most recently, a reduction in government subsidies, urged by the fund, brought an increase in bus fares that touched off riots last month in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. At least 300 people were killed. Both the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> were set up at a meeting in <LOCATION> Bretton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Woods </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, as World War II came to an end. Western leaders were hoping to nip in the bud the economic problems that had twice helped to plunge the world into bloody conflict. The bank, officially the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconstruction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, was to help the countries devastated by the war to recover a decent standard of living. As they did, the bank turned to the Third World, making easy, long-term loans for schools, hospitals, farms, roads, ports _ the basic needs of poor countries. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> were among the biggest borrowers. The fund's job was to keep currencies stable. Big shifts in currency values upset world trade, and bad trade relations can lead to bad political relations. As recently as the 1970s it was helping <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> with such problems. In time the fund too found itself working mostly in the Third World, where high values for local currencies wre making trade difficult. Often the exchange rates were only part of a country's problem The fund offered big loans and mobilized more from private banks. To get the loans, borrowing governments had to promise changes in their policies _ austerity programs, often including devaluations, to put the debtors in better shape to keep up with their debts. Billions went to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and other major debtors. In 1985 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, then secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, said the way out of the debt problem was more loans and more policy changes by the borrowers. The <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan called on the bank to map out longer-term programs for them, since their problems went too deep to be solved in a few years and the bank was used to taking the long view. It had always made some `` policy-based'' loans. Now it started making more. So bank and fund, with headquarters facing one another in downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, found their jobs overlapping more and more. They approached problems from different viewpoints. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Keynes </PERSON>, the British economist who helped set them up, was quoted as saying that the bank is a fund and the fund is a bank. Funds are usually concerned with improving people's living standards; banks worry more about finance. But some of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>'s staff of 1,600 have seen the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> as a collection of 6,000 soft-minded do-gooders Many in the bank thought the fund too preoccupied with the world's financial system and insensitive to people's needs. Neither bank nor fund officials want to be quoted about their differences, except to say that they try hard to work together. But some acknowledge privately that they have occasionally given countries contradictory advice. Last October the bank offered $ 700 million worth of loans to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. The fund had been negotiating with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> for years, but could not get the government of President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> to meet its conditions. The bank's offer raised a lot of eyebrows: in the past, the bank had waited for the fund's approval of a country's policies before going ahead with its own lending In February, after disbursing $ 150 million, the bank decided <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> was not meeting its own conditions and refused to disburse another $ 350 million. There were some quiet `` I-told-you-sos'' from sympathizers with the fund, but officials said the bank's action showed that the two institutions were closer to seeing eye-to-eye.

<HEAD>Farmers Advised to be Wary of Easier Credit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An improving economy and a surge of federal relief measures have put easy credit back within reach of farmers, but an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economist says yielding to temptation could be hazardous to the financial health of some of them. `` Farmers have reasons to be optimistic,'' says <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Gajewski </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` The burdensome grain stocks are dropping and commodity prices are strong in the face of rising domestic and foreign demand.'' <PERSON> Gajewski </PERSON> cites rising land values after years of declines `` and bankers' willingness to lend'' as reflections of farmers' improved outlook. `` But the current optimism is tempered by the knowledge that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and foreign farmers still have the capacity to produce large crops and large volumes of livestock products that could exert downward pressure on agricultural prices and land values,'' he added. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> analyst, writing in the April issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine, said that when the drought hit last summer many farmers needed more credit to cover expenses and gear up for the next season. `` Bankers are often accused of deserting farmers when times get tough, but this apparently did not happen during and after the drought,'' <PERSON> Gajewski </PERSON> said. In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> provided up to $ 4 billion to rescue the ailing Farm Credit System, the national cooperative network of land banks, production credit associations and other units that serve farmers. Drought relief last year added an additional $ 3.9 billion package. Huge outlays for government commodity support programs have pumped billions of dollars into the farm economy, reaching a record $ 25.8 billion just three years ago. `` When combined with rebounding farmland values, the recent rescue of the <ORGANIZATION> FCS </ORGANIZATION>, and other changes in the farm credit delivery system -LRB- including an overhaul of <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> loan policies -RRB-, the good news about credit availability raises questions about how much credit farmers should use,'' <PERSON> Gajewski </PERSON> said. Some financial analysts, he said, are concerned that the recent rise in farmland values may not be supported by future returns. The boom of the 1970s was followed by a collapse in land values. `` During the early and mid-1980s, all of the inflation adjusted gains to farmers from the 1970s land price runup were lost,'' <PERSON> Gajewski </PERSON> said. Agricultural banks in the severe drought areas began 1988 in a stronger position and made relatively more loans through the drought's summer peak than banks did in other areas, he said. For example, loan volume in the drought areas grew by 4.7 percent to 7 percent from the end of 1987 to mid-1988, compared with a 2.9 percent growth at agricultural banks elsewhere. More than half of the nation's roughly 4,500 agricultural banks _ commercial banks that specialize in farm finance _ are located in counties hit hardest by last year's drought. <PERSON> Gajewski </PERSON> said the picture for the Farm Credit System is less clear. Most of the drought damage was in FCS multi-state districts having headquarters in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb. Performing loans _ those without late payments or collateral problems _ grew in volume by 2.6 percent in the three districts during the first half of 1988, compared with a 4.7 percent growth systemwide. `` In general, lenders are willing and able to make new loans to farmers when they believe agricultural prospects look good,'' he said. `` Lower wheat and -LRB- soybean -RRB- stocks, and the consequent runup in commodity prices, have given farmers and their lenders reason for optimism.'' A recent survey of a agricultural bankers in the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> showed that farmland value rose an average of 11.5 percent in 1988, up a fifth from the depressed level of 1986, he said. And a <ORGANIZATION> Minneapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> survey in December showed cropland values up 5.7 percent from a year earlier. `` Farms in both the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> districts were hit hard by the drought,'' <PERSON> Gajewski </PERSON> said. `` Apparently, the drought did not markedly weaken the already rebounding land market. In part, this is because land values reflect expectations about the land's future earning power, not just current earning power. Another factor in making farm credit cheaper and easier to deliver is the new <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> Farmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, which is a secondary market for agricultural real estate loans and rural housing. <PERSON> Gajewski </PERSON> said <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Mac </PERSON> will allow lenders to originate and service fixed-rate and flexible-rate long-term mortgages without keeping the loans on their books. By selling mortgages in the secondary market, lenders will be able to pass on much of the risks while keeping the origination and servicing fees. The Farmer Mac loan sales are ultimately guaranteed by the federal government, although lenders selling loans will have to maintain or contribute to a small reserve against future losses, he said. `` Farmer Mac can benefit farmers, but the loan standards it sets will determine its effectiveness,'' <PERSON> Gajewski </PERSON> said. If the standards are too tight, only the lowest-risk loans will be sold, and the new market will not have much effect. If they're too loose, lenders will be able to pass high-risk farm loans on to non-farm investors, with federal backing `` This would encourage farmers to take on more debt, leaving them more vulnerable to the vicissitudes of weather, the general economy and international markets,'' he said.

<HEAD>Small Third World Farmers Report Gains from Export Crops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When 448 farm households on the Philippine island of <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> switched to raising sugar for sale to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, their earnings per acre grew to nearly double those of their neighbors. The cash crop brought the equivalent of just over $ 100 an acre in a year, compared with about $ 52 an acre for the corn grown by neighboring families. These were poor families, with farms that averaged only about 10 acres. In a country where the average citizen earns about $ 660 a year, the difference was huge. `` Contrary to conventional wisdom, farmers who produce crops for export have more income and are better fed than subsistence farmers who produce only basic food crops for home consumption,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an independent study organization. The institute project was run by <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON>, a West Germam farm economist, with a grant from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> The study found at least one bad effect from the contracts offered by the <ORGANIZATION> Bukidnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>: some corn farmers sold their land or gave up leases and took jobs on sugar farms, creating a new group of landless farm workers. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> suggested that the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government should have gotten the mill to make contracts for sugar with the tenant farmers, as well as with those who owned land. The government could also have taken measures to improve the production of small farms that stayed with growing corn, making credit, fertilizer and new varieties available, he said. Contrary to some people's belief, the researchers saw no damage to child health _ but little improvement either _ from the change to cash crops. While better income from the sugar provided more food for the family, it did little to solve the problem of badly nourished children. Better health and sanitation measures are needed as well, the report said. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> said that as farmers' income rose, the proportion they spent on traditional foods went down. Spending on meat, housing, transport and education rose sharply among the most prosperous farmers in the Philippine group. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> studied farmers not only in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, but also in the east African republic of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> who made a similar switch, and Guatemalans who tried vegetables instead of corn. There were also groups in two more African countries who switched to farming for the market rather than for home consumption. In central African Rwanda they planted potatoes and tea instead of corn. In <LOCATION> Gambia </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast, the shift was from swamp rice to peanuts and to rice under irrigation. The researchers found that when small farmers switched to cash crops, they often kept some of their land in traditional food crops as a kind of insurance. The study said that makes sense, because the income from cash crops is not always certain. Sugar prices have dropped from the levels that first made the switch attractive in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, for example.

<HEAD>Wheat-Growing Regions Still Dry</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Hope for a wetter summer is blossoming in the wake of recent coastal rains, but drought continues in several sections of the nation. Wheat-growing areas of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and adjacent <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> remain particularly dry, and area legislators have already begun to complain about lack of concern in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In the Northeast, meanwhile, a dry winter left reservoirs low, threatening water supplies in parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and other parts of the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> basin. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> declared a drought emergency and imposed strict water-use limits last week, citing low reservoir levels that have not been replenished by winter snowfalls, though recent rains may help some. Recalling low river flows that restricted shipping in the nation's midsection last year, the navigation season on the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is being shortened by five weeks to allow water to be held in reserve at reservoirs, which are only about 60 percent full. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Miskus </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Climate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> reports that storms along the Gulf and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> coasts have helped ease the dryness there somewhat in recent days, and more moisture is expected in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> states. Incoming storms could also bring some needed moisture to the middle of the nation this week, <PERSON> Miskus </PERSON> said. The long-term outlook through mid-April calls for above normal precipitation in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> and the Northeast. But that projection also indicates below normal rain in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and adjacent states and in a large area including <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Some of those areas are badly in need of moisture. Over the winter, fierce winds eroded nearly 4.7 million acres of land in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, one of the most extensive losses on record, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> survey. `` Much of this damage is due to the drought,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> Scaling, chief of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` We went into the wind erosion season with poor cover in much of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> because of the drought. Then this winter, we've had a combination of no snow cover and high-velocity winds in many areas.'' In addition to the land damaged during the four-month period, Scaling said more than 22.5 million acres were `` in condition to blow'' as of March 1, the most in 32 years. Highest on the list are <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, he said. Farm state lawmakers, meanwhile, say the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> is mishandling last year's emergency drought relief and ignoring this year's arid, potentially disastrous conditions on the High Plains. Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, R-Kan., said the central part of the country is `` blowing away'' but help is not forthcoming from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> because of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's slow pace in filling key policy jobs at <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> As of Feb. 28, more than 558,000 producers have received disaster payments and emergency feed assistance amounting to more than $ 2.7 billion, responded <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. On the other hand, along a wide belt from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, moisture has been excessive in recent months, said <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> LeComte </PERSON>. Despite some flooding, that moisture was badly needed in a region that has suffered drought for several years, <PERSON> LeComte </PERSON> said. He said the northern plains are in much better shape than last year, with snow and rain providing beneficial wetness for <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region this winter _ although some subsoils remain dry. Good snow and rains have also wetted down the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and western portions of the corn belt, said <PERSON> LeComte </PERSON>. `` The main spring planting areas were off to a pretty good start.'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, especially <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, remains dry, said <PERSON> LeComte </PERSON>. He said moisture also remains a problem for the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. Things are looking better, but the area still has a lot of rain to make up following three dry winters. <PERSON> Miskus </PERSON> reports that despite recent improvements, <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> received less than half of the normal amount of rainfall between Dec. 1 and March 18. Other regions with less than half of normal wetness for the winter include most of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state; parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, the Gulf Coast, southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>; northern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>; southern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>; most of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and parts of north <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>EPA Defends `Voluntary' Approach to Ozone-Damaging Chemicals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says the hunt to find substitutes for ozone-depleting chemicals will go much quicker without strict government regulation of the chemical industry. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said the agency's policy is voluntary cooperation _ instead of strong government control _ because <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has received `` excellent cooperation'' from the industry. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> was reacting to a recent <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report that concluded the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s policy is failing to ensure the safe testing of chemicals that will take the place of chlorofluorocarbons, or <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s. By not starting the lengthy regulation process now, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> will find itself unable to quickly restrict use of many substitutes shown to endanger human health and the environment, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' investigative agency, said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> should use its powers to demand unpublished test results and quickly slap controls on substitutes believed to endanger the environment or humans. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the 12-nation European Community have pledged to ban chlorofluorocarbons by 1999 _ surpassing the goals of the 1987 Montreal Protocol which requires they be halved by the end of the century. <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s, and related chemicals called halons, are stable and non-toxic when released into the atmosphere, but 10 to 100 years later, when they rise 15-20 miles to the stratosphere, their chemical bonds are broken apart. Scientists say their chlorine atoms destroy ozone, allowing more of the sun's ultraviolet rays to reach <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, causing more skin cancer and eye cataracts, and suppressing human immune systems. The recent <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report called the decision to rely on voluntary cooperation a course that would allow eventual production of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> alternatives `` by anyone, in any amount, and for any use, without prior notification ... or an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> safety review.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> countered, `` We feel using that cooperative relationship is going to obtain the information we need on a much quicker track. `` We have very great concern over toxicity testing'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said, adding that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has `` not ruled out'' using its full authority to regulate the industry `` if we're not getting the cooperation we need.'' `` It's a question of how you do it as quickly as possible while everyone is clamoring for new compounds as quickly as possible,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fay </PERSON>, of the Alliance For Responsible CFC Policy, representing <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> producers and users. `` The concern is you've got some policy makers in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> saying we've got to go faster, and you have regulatory structures that would slow it down,'' he said, comparing the dilemma to sitting at an intersection with both red and green lights. The Toxic Substances Control Act allows <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> not only to demand industry's test results, but to order advance notice from any company planning to convert chemicals designed for other use into CFC substitutes. `` Given the importance of the safety issue, we believe that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s approach to assessing the safety of CFC ... chemical substitutes should include the use of -LRB- the -RRB- two TSCA authorities,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said in a report requested by the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said dependence on voluntary cooperation is a mistake because, `` <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s previous attempt to gather testing information'' from <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> producers in December 1987 `` resulted in incomplete data.'' By ordering the test results, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials could determine if a chemical presented `` an unreasonable health or environmental risk'' and if so, could require testing to determine the specific risks. If necessary, the agency could take actions ranging from labeling requirements to a complete ban. Advance notice of new uses for chemicals would let <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> `` review the safety of these new uses and quickly control'' any substances posing a danger. If EPA determined the information was inadequate to ensure the safety of the new use, the agency could require more testing and prevent the new use while data is gathered. <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s are used as coolants in refrigerators and freezers in home, office and automobile air conditioners; propellants in aerosols; blowing agents for plastic foam products and insulation; cleaning agents for metals and electronic equipment; fast-food cartons, and sterilizing agents for medical instruments. Related chemicals, halons are used in fire extinguishers where foam or water treatment would not work: ships, planes, military vehicles, computer facilities, telephone switching centers and libraries. Substitutes for <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s will be tested for at least two more years before commercial production could begin, <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> said. No substitutes have yet been found for halons.

<DATELINE>MUGLAD, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Starvation and disease, abduction and slavery are some of the atrocities that six years of civil war have inflicted on millions of people of southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. Consider <PERSON> Akwa </PERSON> <PERSON> Karfath </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawal </PERSON>, a woman of <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> descent who fled hunger in her hometown of <LOCATION> Aweil </LOCATION> and ended up in a squalid refugee area just outside <LOCATION> Muglad </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. Armed Arabs abducted her five sons en route, she says, forcing them into slavery as cattle herders. Another woman, <PERSON> Miriyal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayowin </PERSON>, lost two toddlers to starvation and one to the Arabs during the trek out of the south. `` There is nothing in <LOCATION> Aweil </LOCATION> but destruction and we were hungry, so we left,'' she said. `` We ate shrubs as we walked ... but there was no water. `` So many died.'' More than 12,000 refugees in this maze of huts made of sticks and plastic sheets tell similar tales. Dressed in rags, these Dinka tribesmen and their brethren in other camps have been changed by the war from cultivators and cattle breeders to paupers dependent on relief. The Dinka, largest of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s 115 tribes, form the backbone of the rebel army. They are Christians and animists. Rebels began fighting in 1983 for more autonomy from the government, which is dominated by the Moslem Arab majority in the north. On Sunday, a new broad-based Cabinet met for the first time in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> and endorsed a peace plan to end the war. And in April, the world will try to assuage the suffering of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s people with an ambitious emergency relief program coordinated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Relief workers for both Western donor governments and private organizations say the $ 132 million program will save the lives of some of the hundreds of thousands of southern Sudanese who face starvation. But they say the outside world has neglected the war and its ruin for so long that a logistical nightmare will further complicate the already precarious security situation. They doubt the logjams can be sufficiently overcome to prevent another disaster like last summer, when at least 250,000 people died after monsoon rains isolated them without food. Everyone agrees the need is real and urgent, even the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Though the rebels have refused a call by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for a one-month truce to let the food pass, they have pledged not to attack supply convoys in certain protected corridors. The plan is to stockpile 100,000 tons of food, medicine and other supplies in places accessible to 2.25 million southerners in both government and rebel-held areas. The supplies are to be in place before the rainy season starts in May and paralyzes transportation. `` It's an enormous quantity and a short period of time,'' said one relief worker. `` Above all, this is <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>.'' Relief and government officials agreed to the plan for bringing in supplies by train, plane, <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> barge and truck convoy. The government also promised to undo complicated bureaucratic procedures for the relief organizations. For their part, Western relief workers offer endless stories about bureaucratic inefficiency, generally on condition they not be identified. A British-based organization says it had to wait a year before four jeeps were cleared through Sudanese customs. A Dutch diplomat says he tried to transfer $ 4 million in aid to the emergency operation. He was handed forms to fill out and told that the transfer would probably take weeks. Much of the food must be transported to government-held southern areas on Nile barges or trains. However, the barges and trains have made no more than one trip in the past year because of security problems and nervous railway workers. The government says of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s 22 million people, 4 million are southerners. It says half have been displaced by the war to camps in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> or northern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, and half still need relief in the south. Southerners, however, claim they are 6 million. Western relief workers suspect that the discrepancy _ 2 million people _ represents the number who died as a result of the war.

 Improvements in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit will stall out next year without major policy changes on the part of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, posing grave economic dangers for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a research institute warned today. The <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> issued a report forecasting that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trade deficit will begin rising again in 1990 and will hit $ 150 billion by 1992, very near the all-time record imbalance of $ 154 billion set in 1987. The projections are based on the current account, the broadest measure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade. It includes not only trade in merchandise but also trade in services, primarily investment flows between countries. In 1988, the current account deficit narrowed to $ 135 billion, reflecting a surge in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise exports. The current account, also known as the country's balance of payments, shows how much foreign investment will be needed to finance <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trade deficit. Unless something is done to jump-start <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s stalled trade improvement, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, already the world's largest debtor country, will see that debt top $ 1 trillion by 1992, the report predicted. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> net debtor status means that American assets have been traded to foreigners to pay for imported items such as cars and television sets. Because of this, foreigners now own more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments than Americans hold overseas. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>, a senior fellow at the institute and the author of the report, blamed the worsening trade picture on continuing high domestic demand in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which attracts imports and deflects American production away from export markets. To correct the situation, <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> said it is essential that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration reach agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a credible program to meet the targets in the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. The law calls for the deficit to be cut by $ 40 billion annually until the budget is in balance by 1993. <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration also needs to abandon the exchange rate policy <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has been pursuing since February 1987, which has aimed at stabilizing the value of the dollar. Instead, he said, the new administration needs to convince its major trading partners, in particular <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, that further devaluation of the dollar is needed to boost <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s competitiveness by making <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports cheaper on overseas markets <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> said the dollar needs to drop by 25 percent in value against the Japanese yen and by 20 percent in value against the West German mark. Such actions would put the trade deficit back on a declining path, reducing it to an annual rate of around $ 50 billion by 1992. <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> said trying to eliminate the entire trade deficit is not really feasible. `` To go all the way to a zero trade deficit would meet very stiff resistance'' from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading partners, <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I think it will be a major challenge just to get it down from $ 150 billion to $ 50 billion annually.'' <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> warns, as have other economists, that higher and higher levels of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign debt will ultimately lower <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s living standard as more and more resources are transferred to foreigners to pay interest payments on the debt. Such high levels of foreign borrowing also leave the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy vulnerable to foreign investors, who could suddenly decide they no longer want to hold <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments, the study said. The growing debt burdens run the risk of a `` collapse of confidence in the dollar, triggering a further surge of inflation and interest rates _ and possibly a recession,'' the report said. `` At a minimum, they would weaken <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future growth by requiring persistently high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates to attract the needed foreign funds.'' The Cline study was based on computer models which simulated global trade flows based on various economic scenarios. Among the report's conclusions: _ Every percentage point boost in growth in the economies of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s major trading partners will result in a decline of $ 9 billion to $ 13 billion in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> current account deficit by 1992 _ Every percentage point drop in the dollar's exchange value against other currencies produces a trade improvement of between $ 8 billion and $ 10 billion by 1992 as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods are made more competitive on overseas markets _ Each percentage point drop in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economic growth rate produces $ 15 billion in improvements in the deficit by lowering the demand for imports <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>'s study argues that major reductions in the federal budget deficit would dampen the growth of domestic demand, thus cutting <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s appetite for foreign goods. The study said that if the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> act quickly to implement the budget cuts, it will allow the necessary shift from a consumption-driven economy to an export-driven economy without a recession. The institute is a non-profit research organization which analyzes international economic issues.

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The country's chief opposition leader was picked at a weekend convention to run for president in May 1 elections, but his party vowed to boycott a new government in the event of election fraud. <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, accepted his party's nomination Sunday night and vowed in his speech to defend <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s peasants and adopt economic policies to meet their needs. `` We will work with the clean hands and moral strength of the people,'' said <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, 53, an economist and former university professor. He was exiled for seven years by the recently deposed government of Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> was expelled by <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s government in 1981 after writing a book about the business activities of Nicaraguan dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. The Nicaraguan, a friend of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, was granted asylum in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> after his ouster in 1979. He was assassinated a year later on an <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> street. `` Who is to say that on May 1, there will not be a new government composed of the glorious <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>?'' said <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>. He was the only candidate proposed for the presidency at the convention. <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> was carried from the convention hall on the shoulders of supporters following his acceptance speech. Delegates also approved candidates for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The May 1 elections will pick a president to fill the four years remaining in the five-year term of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, who was ousted Feb. 3 by Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. The coup leader, who had served as an aide to <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, declared himself provisional president, dissolved <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and called for new elections. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest and best-organized party, has governed since 1947. It is expected to ratify <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> as its presidential candidate at a convention set for April 1. `` We know that many sectors of the government harbor hidden intentions of legitimizing the current de facto government,'' said <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> from 1967 to 1977. In recent weeks, the party has repeatedly criticized what it views as irregularities in voter registration, and it has suggested the <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> government might be trying to steal the election. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, who had led <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> since a 1954 coup, was elected to an eighth consecutive term in February 1988 elections widely regarded as fraudulent. A plan adopted by <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>'s party calls for rejecting any seats won in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> if it deems the May 1 balloting to be fraudulent. Even if the elections are viewed as fair, the party still would withdraw from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> if electoral law reforms and changes in voter registration lists are not made before municipal elections scheduled for October 1990. The party claims voter lists are inflated in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. It also conditioned its participation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on revocation of a law which allows a president to serve an unlimited number of terms. It also demands repeal of two laws frequently used under <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> to crack down on dissidents and a ban on soldiers belonging to political parties.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Computer games, three-dimensional maps and nature trails are being developed to help visitors understand how last year's forest fires were actually useful. Space-age techniques went into the production of some of the interpretive projects, which were considered nine months ago when fires began consuming what would eventually consume nearly half of the 2.2 million-acre park. `` Around the first of July we began to realize that we were not only confronted with an incredible history-making event in terms of fire suppression, but with a virtually unprecedented educational opportunity as well,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s chief naturalist. Forestry officials say the fires prompt rebirth in the wilderness, clearing away the old, dead and overgrown while making way for new vegetation and new wildlife habitats. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> worked with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s Harpers Ferry, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, creative design center to develop exhibits and signs that will be located along <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s roads The projects were conceived `` as ways of helping people ... to better understand what happened in the summer of 1988,'' he said. Among them is an exhibit at <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, which was surrounded on three sides by flames from the Snake Complex of fires and on the fourth by <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>. `` It will be about a $ 250,000 exhibit on fire and fire ecology,'' he said, adding it could be installed by June. He said it will include a video of the 1988 fire season. Also planned at the visitor center is a computer-enhanced map of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> that is being developed with the help of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> technicians. The map will give an eagle's eye view of the park. The map may be seen through a touch-sensitive screen on a video monitor, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` Simply touch and fly north to south on a simulated overflight and actually see with computer-generated graphics what the area might have looked like on a given day during the summer of 1988,'' he said. The development of a computer game will enable people to change various factors to affect the fires. `` What if we had rain, in adequate quantities, in June, July and August?'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> asked, explaining the concept. `` What if we had not had the high winds, unprecedented winds?

Some of the more traditional projects include nature trails that would wind through burned, and unburned, sections of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>; three one-way roads to lead motorists through burned and unburned areas; a movie on the fires; and a large pamphlet that would show a burned lodgepole pine forest with the animal life expected to be seen in the area after the fires. The pamphlet will not be specific to <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, but also will show the effects of fire on the Alaskan tundra, the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, and the sequoia forests in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` There will be included, as a matter-of-fact, computer images of fires that were burning throughout the world during the same time,'' he said. `` A multimillion-acre fire in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that was not even known about until very late in the year because the Chinese and Russians did n't make a big event out of it. ... `` There were fires burning in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> basin and in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that were started by man that dwarfed in magnitude the fires that burned in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said he hopes the project in its entirety will be instructive `` to the role of fire as an element in our lives and the lives of the forest.''

<HEAD>Agreement Designed to Safeguard Government Computer Files</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A new agreement between the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and a research arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> aims to bolster their joint efforts to safeguard sensitive information handled by thousands of federal government computer systems. The memorandum of understanding was signed late last week by the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION>'s director, Vice Adm. W.O. <PERSON> Studeman </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kammer </PERSON>, acting director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. Under prodding from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the two agencies have started working closely together to review computer security plans submitted by offices throughout the government for protecting systems containing sensitive but unclassified data. The effort has been spurred by mounting concern over so-called computer viruses, including a virus `` attack'' last November that crippled more than 6,000 computers connected to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Internet electronic network. <ORGANIZATION> NIST </ORGANIZATION>, based in suburban <LOCATION> Gaithersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, serves as a national reference and measurement laboratory for the physical and engineering sciences. It performs a wide range of research intended to benefit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry. The supersecret <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, is the nation's biggest intelligence agency, with a work force topping 60,000 employees _ more than all other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spy agencies combined _ and a budget said to be upwards of $ 10 billion a year. Its main missions are eavesdropping on communications around the world, encrypting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> communications and cracking foreign codes, as well as protecting the security of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computers and communications systems. <PERSON> Kammer </PERSON> said Friday that the agreement `` provides a structure for discussions between NSA and us if there are issues that arise where there is a conflict between a classified or national security issue and regular civilian data issues. By and large, it's a commitment by us to work together.'' He noted that the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION>'s current position toward cooperating with <ORGANIZATION> NIST </ORGANIZATION> _ under legislation signed into law early last year _ contrasted with the intelligence agency's previous attitude. `` We went through a bad spot about a year ago,'' <PERSON> Kammer </PERSON> said. `` There was a feeling by the then-management of NSA that the Computer Security Act was a problem, something that they opposed. ... The management team that's in there now has taken the philosophy that it's the law of the land, let's get it done. That's been a big and refreshing change. <PERSON> Kammer </PERSON> told a congressional hearing last week that as of March 13, the joint NIST-NSA review team had received 1,543 computer security plans _ 74 from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and the remainder from civilian agencies. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said last September that federal agencies at that time had identified 53,443 computer systems _ an estimated 52,000 of them within the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ containing sensitive data. Testifying before two House Science subcommittees, <PERSON> Kammer </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NIST </ORGANIZATION> had been working with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> to establish an `` emergency response capability'' to deal with `` malicious software attacks'' such as computer viruses. Viruses are generally small strings of computer code that can be stealthily inserted into software programs _ and spread widely through electronic networks _ to cause computers to malfunction by clogging memory, destroying or altering data, or other actions. `` For the current fiscal year I have redirected $ 200,000 to start up an effort to coordinate responses to computer security incidents and to create an information clearinghouse,'' <PERSON> Kammer </PERSON> said. Appearing at the same hearing, the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Studeman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has ordered his agency to `` pursue intensive research and development with the objective of identifying means to counter computer viruses.'' `` Today there are no known solutions that can guarantee protection of a system against malicious software,'' he said. But <PERSON> Studeman </PERSON> added that `` we believe strongly that the proper use of trusted products, coupled with sound system security management and increased funding and emphasis in the area of research and development, offers the best hope for preventing, detecting and containing such attacks.'' Provisions of the four-page memorandum of understanding include: _ <ORGANIZATION> NIST </ORGANIZATION> will draw upon computer technical security guidelines developed by the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> NIST </ORGANIZATION> will request the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION>'s assistance on all matters related to cryptographic techniques _ <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> will carry out research and development programs in `` trusted technology,'' telecommunications security, encryption techniques and personal identification methods _ <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> will `` conduct assessments of the hostile intelligence threat to federal information systems, and provide technical assistance and recommend endorsed products for application to secure systems against that threat. _ <ORGANIZATION> NIST </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> will jointly review agency plans for the security and privacy of computer systems _ <ORGANIZATION> NIST </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> will `` maintain an ongoing, open dialogue'' to ensure that each organization remains abreast of emerging technologies and issues affecting the security automated information systems

 It was a convention that seemed stranger than fiction. The Tacoma Sheraton was invaded by 1,500 science fiction fans for Norwescon XI, a convention that featured a masquerade ball, seminars on the physical properties of alien worlds, chain mail fabrication and Star Trek. The activities turned the heads of hotel guests not attending the convention. On one stairway, a starfighter and a Venusian princess brushed by two businessmen, while nearby a barbarian adjusted his battle gear. `` What is this?'' one businessman asked the other. The conference ended Sunday.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> decried religious oppression in his Easter message and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders worldwide groped for meaning in this world where, as one put it, `` the worst often does happen.'' In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> on Sunday, Christians called for the pope to visit their communist nation. In some parts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, people heard Masses for the first time in years. Elsewhere Sunday, shells and rockets pounded <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as Lebanese Christians commemorated Easter. In <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, about 30 members of the dwindling Western community gathered for services. About 180,000 faithful crowded the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Square for the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s message commemorating the resurrection of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>. In his 20-minute speech in Italian, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> lamented religious persecution, exploitation of women, degeneration of family life, sectarian strife and lack of concern for the environment. Earlier Sunday, the pope, squinting in the warm spring sun, held a Mass on the steps of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Basilica. Calling Easter the new Passover, a reference to the Old Testament account of the miraculous rescue of the Jews in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said: `` God passes where there do not exist conditions worthy of a truly human life, through lack of housing, promiscuity, vagrancy, where selfishness withers the fruitfulness of marriage and the family breaks up.'' He also decried violence against children and the `` shameful commerce of vice ... -LRB- where -RRB- women are still the main victim.'' The pope devoted much of his message, broadcast to 50 countries, to places `` where consciences are oppressed, where Christ's faithful can not openly invoke him or suffer persecution because of their love of him. He said Easter proclaims a needed truth `` to today's world, which in so many ways seems to be rushing headlong towards self-destruction and death.'' In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, Patriarch <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> issued an Easter plea for peace and blamed politicians for the violence in the Holy Land. `` We find the reality of the Holy Land, a reality of death and suffering,'' <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, the first Palestinian to serve as Roman Catholic patriarch of the city, told pilgrims at <ORGANIZATION> Easter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. `` We find those who tell us each day: We are hungry, we are humiliated, we are prisoners, we have no schooling,'' he said. `` We find those who have died and those who have yet to die while the politicians take their time finding answers.'' <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> alluded to the searing conflict between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> during a Mass intoned in Latin, French and Arabic on the site where Christians believe <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was resurrected. <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, named bishop in January 1987, never directly mentioned the 15-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. But his mention of the `` two peoples in this Holy Land'' and his repeated references to death clearly evoked the revolt in which more than 400 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have been killed. In the Soviet Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, many Christians celebrated the Easter Mass for the first time in years. Last year, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> handed back confiscated cathedrals to many communities after decades in government hands. In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, about 400 people gathered beneath the balcony of 89-year-old Roman Catholic Cardinal <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>'s Baroque residence shouting, `` Long Live Our Father!'' and `` We Want the Holy Father!'' in a call for the Polish-born pontiff to visit <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> is the only Soviet bloc country where Communist authorities have for decades blocked the appointment of religious leaders. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, Archbishop <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, head of the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the world's leading Anglican, told a congregation at <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>: `` We live in a world in which the worst looks as if it is going to happen and the worst often does happen, and yet out of the anguish and waste, love and trust come in new forms.'' `` A sober look at the world seems to raise more fear than hope,'' <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> told the congregation at <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Following are excerpts from the official <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> translation in English of Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s Easter Sunday message, which was delivered in Italian: In this Passover is inscribed the new and eternal covenant. The covenant of the God of Life with man, condemned to death. The covenant with humanity. The covenant with the world. With `` the world which is the theater of the history of the human race.'' With the world which Christians believe was created and is kept in existence by the love of the Creator. With the world subject to the slavery of sin but which _ with defeat of the Evil One _ by the disobedience of Christ even unto death has been set free. In Christ crucified and risen this liberation remains in God for all human beings. In Christ crucified and risen the world has been restored to God so that it may be fashioned anew according to God's design and reach that fullfillment willed by God from all eternity ... Over these tragedies and triumphs of today's world, of the man of today, <PERSON> God </PERSON> continues to pass through the Resurrection of his Son, the Son of Man. He passes and sets free, as at the time of the Exodus, as at the moment when Christ rises, and transforms the world. God passes and frees from the fear that oppresses so many of our brothers and sisters in the face of the uncertainty of the future, everywhere in the world, he passes where death expresses once more its horrors, where suffering imprints its marks on flesh and on souls, he passes where there do not exist conditions worthy of a truly human life through the lack of housing, promiscuity, vagrancy, where selfishness withers the fruitfulness of marriage and the family breaks up, where the innocence of children is exploited and corrupted, where violence is done to their defenseless goodness, where the shameful commerce of vice is carried on and women are still its main victim. God passes and sets free, the Passover of the Resurrection, from the perils of intolerance whatever name it bears where the proclamation of Easter has not reached or is hindered, where consciences are oppressed, where Christ's faithful can not openly invoke him or suffers persecution because of the love of him and his Church and because of their faithfulness to their rites and their own age-old religious traditions. He passes in the countries where Christians can not gather about the altars to celebrate the Eucharist where the flock waits for its own pastor, whose guidance it misses and longs for. For religious freedom, though it is deeply felt by consciences and is written in the constitutions of states and in international conventions, is often today trampled upon in many different ways. God likewise passes where on the troubled and bloodstained horizon of various countries the longed-for peace is yet to be seen where men, though they are brothers, fight one another in a scene of destruction and hatred as is still happening in the beloved and tormented <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. ... In his blood all is reconciled: man with God, with himself, with nature: at this point there gains new strength and awareness. ... This is the truth which Easter proclaims to today's world which in so many ways seems to be rushing headlong toward self-destruction and death ... Easter, the Passover of the Lord, lasts unchangeably. It can not be blotted out, either in the history of the human race or in the history of the whole creation. It lasts unchangeably. Christ's Resurrection has not been `` added'' to history It is the history _ the whole history _ of man, which is inscribed in this unique day which the Lord has made so that he can make all things new.

 A man underwent a successful kidney transplant after he was plucked by helicopter from a remote campsite and taken to a hospital for the organ that matched his rare blood type, officials said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON>, 47, was listed in critical but stable condition late Sunday, according to officials at <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>. `` Everything went just great. His kidney is already showing early signs of function,'' Dr. <PERSON> Garo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tertzakian </PERSON> said after he performed the two-hour surgery earlier in the day. <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON> was camping with his wife and daughter in <LOCATION> Imperial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> border when doctors found a kidney donor whose blood type was B-positive, shared by only about 15 percent of the population. Time was of the essence because organ must be transplanted within a certain time. The organ was located Saturday night and the nine-hour search began. `` <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON> decided that he was going to go to the end of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' said Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> KNX-AM </ORGANIZATION> radio pilot <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Tur </PERSON>, who found <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON> after flying through a rainstorm and serendipitously picking up <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>, who also was looking for his father. The older <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON>, an accounting manager at <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, carried an electronic pager linking him to the hospital but his camping trip took him out of its range. <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON> had driven about 100 mph to the area where he thought his father might be. Tur, who volunteered after he heard of <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON>'s plight, lifted off at 1 a.m. Sunday from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> with his friend <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> as co-pilot. They picked up two <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Search </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> team members along the way. `` We were told if we do n't find them by 4 a.m., forget it,'' Tur said. He said doctors explained the kidney would not be fresh enough to transplant if <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON> could not be found and dialysis preparation started by 5 a.m., and Tur figured the trip to the hospital would take about an hour. The search for <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON>'s white motor home with two all-terrain vehicles was not easy. `` Not only are there a thousand people in campers, but they're all white, they all have ATV's,'' Tur said `` We were yelling over the P.A., ` <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON>, we have a kidney. Identify yourself or notify the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.''' They eventually saw a flash of light, and found <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON>, whose truck had become trapped in sand, Tur said. The crew picked up the younger <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON> and took off again in a rainstorm. Just before 4 a.m., in a large sand dune park near <LOCATION> Glamis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON> spotted his father's mobile home. `` The son leans over ... and says ` That's it!''' Tur said. As the helicopter was landing, the craft's night light went out but the five landed safely. Tur and the younger <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON> ran up to the mobile home and banged on the door until a bleary-eyed <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON> woke up. They told him there was no time for him to get fully dressed and flew him to a nurse and a small plane, waiting on the ground at nearby <LOCATION> Brawley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The plane took <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON> to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Airport </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where a waiting ambulance took him to the hospital. `` It was nerve-wracking,'' said <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON>.

<HEAD>New Cabinet Endorses Peace Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As its first act, a new coalition Cabinet has endorsed a tentative peace agreement with southern rebels and called for an immediate cease-fire in the country's six-year civil war. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s people are weary of war and the famine it has bred. The peace plan, adopted Sunday, endorses the controversial suspension of Islamic laws, a major demand of the rebels, who are mostly Christians and animists of African descent. The Cabinet also urged opening talks with the rebels, who contend the Moslem Arab north treats them unfairly and have been fighting for increased autonomy. The issue of Islamic law has kept the country's fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> from joining Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s coalition government, which includes all other parties and interest groups The war costs the faltering economy $ 1 million a day, and related famine has killed hundreds of thousands of southerners. Information and Culture Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Saleh </PERSON> told reporters the Cabinet has decided to form a committee to seek contacts with the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The rebels, led by Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>, signed the agreement Nov. 16 with the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, then the senior partner in <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s Cabinet. However, the new government and rebels must now meet to work out how to impose a cease-fire and other details of the plan. It calls for lifting the state of emergency in effect since President <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> was overthrown in April 1985 and a constitutional conference to negotiate peace. Initially, <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> refused to sign the agreement, maneuvering to deprive the Unionists of credit for reaching a settlement where his own party failed. The Unionists quit the government over the issue in December, and <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> replaced them with the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. That move, coupled with a successful rebel offensive, led the army to intervene. It issued an ultimatum for <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> to resign or form a broad-based Cabinet to bring peace. Political parties and trade and professional unions supported the army's demands. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> finally complied and swore in his new Cabinet on Saturday. Peace talks and a cease-fire, if achieved, would greatly help an international relief operation to send 100,000 tons of food and supplies to the south before the rainy season starts in May. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has warned that 100,000 to 600,000 people could die in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> this summer if the operation fails.

 To Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> over the last 200 years has been a rock-bound channel, able to contain the onrushing passions of the moment without losing its essential and original shape and purpose. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, in what he calls a `` labor of love,'' has pursued that theme in a seven-pound history of the institution as it developed over the past two centuries. The book, called `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ 1789-1989'' and available through the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, is a lavishly illustrated and meticulous account based on 42 of the 100 speeches <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> delivered on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in an unprecedented series that began on a spring morning in 1980. `` One of my two granddaughters was in the gallery with other members of her fifth-grade class,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> recalls. `` I decided I should mark the occasion by talking a little about the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and its history for that class. `` I had no notes; I spoke for an hour,'' he said. On the next Friday his older granddaughter was in the gallery and <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> decided to make another speech in her honor. `` But I thought I ought to make a different speech, so I talked about the traditions and the customs of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. That's how it started; that was the seed of the idea. I determined there was fully enough material to do 100 speeches on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. I saw that it was going to take a number of years.'' For most of the next decade, when the business of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had been completed for the day, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> rose to advance his project another notch, delivering what a generation of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> clerks and pages, and doorkeepers, reporters and fellow senators came to call `` <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s history lessons.'' The result is a narrative history of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from the uncertain first steps of the first <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the late winter and spring of 1789 through the calamity of civil war in the 1860s and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Watergate investigation of the 1970s. The assembly of those speeches into a book was a `` mini-Manhattan Project,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> says, proudly noting that he proofread the book five times _ `` every comma, every colon, every em-dash.'' To <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, the most remarkable fact about the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s 200 years is the way that historic themes tend to repeat themselves. Is there concern over the negative tone of last year's presidential campaign he asks. Then consider, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> says, the campaign of 1828 when the partisans of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> called rival <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` a gambler, a drunkard and a duelist'' as well as an adulterer, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters retaliated in kind, portraying <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> as `` a monarchist, a gourmandizer and a spendthrift.'' `` Slander was infectious,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> says. This year's 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> opened with a donnybrook over a proposed large congressional pay raise. Old hat, says <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>. Pay squabbles date to the first <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and began in earnest in 1816 when it was proposed that the pay rate of $ 6 a day be changed to a $ 1,500 a year. The result: Public Outrage. The further result, according to <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>: `` In the next election two-thirds of the members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> were defeated. Several senators were also defeated and some resigned rather than stand for re-election.'' Also this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> tied itself into emotional knots over President's <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination of former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to be secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, a battle that led to <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>'s defeat. Nothing new in that, says <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>. On a March day in 1843, President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>'s nomination of Rep. <PERSON> Caleb </PERSON> <PERSON> Cushing </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to be secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> was rejected three times in three roll call votes on a single day. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was in a nasty mood that day. It twice rejected <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>'s nomination of Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to be minister to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and defeated his nominees to head the navy and war departments and scuttled his nominee as minister to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. To top things off, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>'s nomination of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> for a seat on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s experience with the Tower nomination ca n't compare to that, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said he hopes his history, which is available from the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, will be a contribution to the institutional memory of the place. `` Nothing has changed in 200 years,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is still guided by the Constitution and the knowledge that everything that comes before it is just a new set of circumstances come to center stage.''

 A West German tourist was trampled to death by an elephant that she tried to play with during a hike in northern <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, a police officer said today. The officer, who asked not to be named, said <PERSON> Helga </PERSON> <PERSON> Torbirt </PERSON>, 49, was killed in the accident Friday in <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dao </PERSON>, a town about 20 miles north of the major northern city of <LOCATION> Chiang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mai </LOCATION> near the Burmese border. Her hometown was not available. He said she and her husband, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, and other tourists had just completed a journey by raft and were taking a break in Wang Pasak village. Tourists in the group said they were sitting by a stream when Mrs. <PERSON> Torbirt </PERSON> approached an elephant that was bathing there. The animal panicked, rushed toward the woman, grabbed her with its trunk and threw her to the ground and trampled her, the officer said.

 <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> is going to have the first state laboratory in the nation with a data bank of genetic prints, which allow police to nab criminals from scanty physical evidence like saliva left at a crime scene. The <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> will provide DNA testing for the state's police and sheriff's departments beginning May 1 DNA testing is `` the most significant development for law enforcement since fingerprinting, and that dates back about 100 years,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON>, director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forensic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>. The lab will develop a computerized data bank of DNA prints of sex offenders in the state. State legislation passed last month requires sex offenders to submit blood samples for DNA analysis. DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, is found in the chromosomes of cells, including saliva, hair, blood, semen, tissue and bone marrow. Only identical twins can have the same DNA pattern, or genetic blueprint. Scientists in recent years have developed technology for taking DNA from body fluids or tissue left at a crime scene and matching it with the genetic blueprint of a suspect. `` If a rapist leaves seminal fluid at the scene ... he might as well be leaving his Social Security card,'' <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON> said. He said DNA testing already helped nabbed one person in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, who was convicted of three capital murders on the basis of genetic printing. `` I'm not a lawyer, but based on what I've been told, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> probably never would have been convicted without the DNA testing,'' <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON> said. The case is under review by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON> said DNA testing also could serve as a criminal deterrent. He said criminals can be careful not to leave fingerprints, as <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> was, but the chances of committing a violent crime without leaving a DNA sample are slim. Pre-DNA analysis of body fluids, tissue and hair left at crime scenes consisted of examining enzymes and blood types _ processes which only narrowed the list of possible perpetrators. `` Conventional serological evidence was always circumstantial,'' <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON> said. `` You could say that a particular sample could have come from, say, 13 percent of the male population. But with DNA testing, you can say this sample definitely came from that person. It's just like fingerprints in that respect.'' DNA is inherited, with each parent contributing one-half. For about 10 years, scientists have used DNA testing to establish paternity and to research genetically related diseases. About three years ago, DNA testing was first used to solve a rape in a small town in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON> said. The technology has since been used to solve several crimes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> is among the first states to implement widespread DNA testing. Two <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> serologists were trained in DNA testing at a lab in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON> received $ 80,000 from the state for equipment and supplies. Last year, <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON> secured an additional $ 200,000 in state funds to keep the program going.

 The release of <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who once was three days from execution for a crime he long claimed he did n't commit, has put the spotlight on a judicial system that imprisoned `` The Thin Blue Line'' defendant <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police, prosecutors and judges `` have lost some credibility with the public and the only thing that will restore it is time, if they can demonstrate they will not be as zealous and rabid as they demonstrated this -LRB- past -RRB- week,'' said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who spent 12 -LCB- years in prison, was freed last week on grounds he received an unfair trial. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> dropped the charges, saying there was n't enough evidence to retry <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> for the 1976 slaying of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> soon found himself on the defensive, trying to explain why his department had failed to examine <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' case before and fought court orders to free <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. Defense attorneys and others are questioning how the case was handled from the time prosecutors suppressed evidence at the 1977 trial to an assistant district attorney's contention last week that judges who ruled in <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' favor should be disqualified because of their liberal beliefs. `` Do we have within the prosecutor's department people who do not really understand or respect the rule of law?'' the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> questioned in an editorial Saturday. `` Is that the lesson of the <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> case? ... If it is, then no one in the community is separated from the fate of <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> by more than the thinnest of whims.'' The editorial called for <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> to heal the district attorney's office of a `` strong and dangerous streak of abuse and fanaticism. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> maintains the criminal justice system did not fail <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. `` I think Mr. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> would be the first to admit to you that the criminal justice system works,'' <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said. `` If it did n't, he would be on death row.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was three days from the electric chair in 1980, but the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled his jury had been improperly selected. Instead of seeking a retrial, then-District Attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> persuaded Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> to commute <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' sentence to life in prison. `` One has to question, if they were convinced <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was a cop killer, why did n't they go back a second time and get the death penalty?'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesser </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> defense attorney. It was just such questions that prompted film maker <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> to re-examine <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' case in the 1988 documentary `` The Thin Blue Line.'' The film showed prosecution witness <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> recanting his testimony that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was the trigger man, as well as other witnesses giving information that conflicted with their testimony. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> now is on death row for an unrelated murder. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> retired in 1986, but the never-quit reputation of his office carried on with <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, the assistant district attorney who fought against retrial or release for <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. Earlier this year, State District Judge <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> recommended that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> get a new trial or be set free. The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> concurred. <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> last week ordered <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> released on a $ 50,000 personal recognizance bond. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> spent an extra night in jail, however, after <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> tried to have <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> removed from the case and <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' bail increased to a $ 100,000 cash bond <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> acknowledged he had not read the opinions of the appellate court and <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON>, but said it was clear <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> and eight of the nine appellate judges were liberal and biased toward <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. Another state district judge denied <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s arguments and cleared <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' release. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> was not in his office when called by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Prosecutors have consistently declined to comment on the case. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> did not return messages from the AP. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said he will order a transcript of the recent hearings, including <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s testimony, and look into it as a personnel matter. But he defended <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, saying he has done an outstanding job for years. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' attorney said prosecutors were right to investigate <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> aggressively but could have handled the complex case better. `` It's that hard case that really is a measure of the quality of a justice system and in this case they failed miserably,'' <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> said.

 Less than an hour after former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> death row inmate <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> discussed his newly gained freedom on national television last week, the state put another inmate to death. The timing was n't lost on the nearly 300 condemned men who remain on the row, the nation's second largest, who argue that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> may not have been the only one who was wrongly convicted. `` They're talking about this guy getting off death row and here's some guy getting executed the same time and they're not talking about that,'' said convicted killer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Beathard </PERSON>. `` I see a whole lot of conflicting signals to the public,'' said <PERSON> Beathard </PERSON>. `` It should be obvious to people they're going to kill some innocent people out there.'' <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, who was convicted of a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> murder 11 years ago, was executed by lethal injection last Wednesday shortly after <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> appeared on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline'' program. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has executed 30 inmates since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> restored the death penaly in 1976, more than any other state. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was the subject of `` The Thin Blue Line,'' a documentary that questioned his 1977 conviction for killing a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officer. He came within three days of death in 1980 before his sentence was commuted to life in prison. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was freed last week under a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruling that said he did n't receive a fair trial because prosecutors suppressed evidence and witnesses lied on the stand. Prosecutors in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> said they would n't retry him. `` Is n't it nice that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> gets relief _ and then we continue on with the executions,'' said <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Bower </PERSON>, another death row convict. `` How many mistakes have to be pointed out and discovered? ... How many do you have to see before someone says, ` Well, just how many could there be?' And if there can be, can we justify continuing executing?'' King, like many of the 29 inmates who preceded him to the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> death chamber since the state resumed executions in 1982, had a second trial after his first conviction and death sentence were thrown out on a technicality. `` A number of men with cases similar to his, mine included, had <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> issues,'' says <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, whose conviction and death sentence for the slaying of a state trooper were reversed. Unlike <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, however, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> was tried again, convicted again and sentenced to death again. The most famous contested death row case is that of <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>, a black man facing execution for the 1980 rape-slaying of a white teenage girl. He was convicted and sentenced to die in a second trial after his first ended with a hung jury. But a state district judge has recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> grant a new trial, saying his conviction and sentencing were marred by racial prejudice, perjured testimony and a biased investigation. The appeals court is reviewing the case. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Walt </PERSON>, the assistant attorney general who handles capital cases in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said the cases of <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> show that the system catches trial and prosecutor errors and ensures innocent people are n't put to death. `` You obviously have some fear at some point but that fear diminishes over time as more and more judges see and review the case,'' said <PERSON> Walt </PERSON>. `` The system eliminates any realistic possibility that innocent people would be executed.'' <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> also understands the inmates' distaste for what his office does. `` I would n't like anyone who's trying to get me killed,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A high-seas standoff between the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and 250 U.S.-bound Haitians packed aboard a rickety 50-foot sailboat ended peacefully after a 30-hour confrontation that included threats babies would be thrown overboard. The Haitians agreed Sunday to the leave the boat and be returned to their country. No injuries were reported. One refugee woman was rescued after leaping into the sea and others vowed to throw their infant children overboard unless they were allowed to continue toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Starks </PERSON>. `` It was really an ordeal and there were some very tense moments,'' said <PERSON> Starks </PERSON>. `` There was no idea what would happen and none of the Haitians had life jackets. There was a potential for a significant loss of life.'' The sailboat was discovered about 9 a.m. EST Saturday by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter Escape, which was transporting nearly 100 Haitians intercepted the previous day back to the impoverished nation, officials said. A rope was used to immobilize the rudder of the refugee vessel and four other <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutters were sent to the scene before the Haitians surrendered about 120 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Starks </PERSON> said. The cutters Escape and Steadfast were traveling toward <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> today, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> Starks </PERSON> said none of the refugees had weapons and no one was injured, although three ill Haitians were transported to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Some of the Haitians aboard the Escape refused to eat in an act of sympathy with the other refugees, he said. The standoff revealed the growing frustration driving record numbers of refugees to seek <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s shores, a Haitian leader said. `` This incident is just a hint of what could become common,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean-Juste </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Haitian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and a spokesman for the city's Haitian community. `` Some of those on the boats are army defectors and will do just about anything to keep from going back to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jean-Juste </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jean-Juste </PERSON> said the influx of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> immigrants into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is fueling resentment among Haitians, who are routinely returned to their homeland after being stopped at sea. Under Immigration and Naturalization Service policy, brief hearings are held with refugees intercepted at sea and only those deemed political asylum candidates are allowed to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Other so-called `` economic refugees'' are returned to their native country. Only five of the more than 20,000 Haitians interviewed at sea since 1981 have been brought into the country for asylum hearings. This month, about 1,400 Haitians have been stopped at sea, more than any other month in the eight-year interdiction program.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Say Dissident Faces Arrest For Visiting North</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government prosecutors said today that a dissident leader who made an unauthorized visit to communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to discuss reuniting the two Koreas will be arrested if he returns to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. In a separate action, police detained 23 dissident writers and supporters who tried to reach the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> border today for a reunification meeting with communist delegates at the <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> truce site. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> officials had prohibited the meeting. Prosecutor <PERSON> Bae </PERSON> <PERSON> Jae-wook </PERSON> said the Rev. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ik-hwan </PERSON> would face prosecution under tough national security laws for making his unauthorized visit to the north to meet top communist officials. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> could face up to 10 years imprisonment if convicted. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s surprise arrival Saturday in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> after a trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> shocked capitalist <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The two Koreas are bitter rivals who have clashed repeatedly, and their border is sealed. South Korean officials criticized <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> for a speech he made in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> describing <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> as a `` respectable president.'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, who rules one of the world's most repressive police states, is widely feared in the south for having started the Korean War. Many South Koreans believe he still wants to conquer their country. Unification Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hong-koo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s unauthorized visit was an attempt to undermine President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s efforts to improve relations with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s visit aided <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by giving the impression that some <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> support the <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> government. South Korean dissidents, rejecting their government's efforts to improve relations with the north, have been trying to start a dialogue with the north on reuniting the peninsula. The dissidents claim to speak for people in the south despite their lack of public support. Pro-Western <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> were divided at the end of World War II and fought the Korean war from 1950 to 1953. They are technically still at war because no peace treaty was signed, and more than 1 million heavily armed soldiers face each other across the 150-mile border. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> ordered a major crackdown last week on radical groups after charging they were attempting to stage a leftist revolution. Government officials said <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s visit was part of those attempts to undermine the administration. Dissident groups calling for <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s overthrow have been staging violent protests, but they are not viewed as a major threat to the government. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> last week indefinitely postponed a promised referendum on his performance, citing a threat of radical violence. Senior South Korean army commanders deplored <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s visit at a meeting today and demanded he be punished, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency, reported. The main opposition parties all said today that <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> should not have gone to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> without government permission. However, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, the South's main dissident alliance, expressed support for <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> at a press conference `` We hope he will return home with fruitful results,'' the alliance said in a press statement. The two Koreas have been holding intermittent talks since last August on improving relations. Little progress has been made because each side has tended to push its own proposals and ignore the other's initiatives.

<TEXT>
 The wife of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain who mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner with 290 people on board began appearing on television today in spots aimed at finding whoever planted a bomb that destroyed her van. Authorities believe the bomb, which exploded while <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was driving the van on March 10, might have been the work of terrorists. `` We do n't know who did it. We just must realize that someone is out there who committed a very cowardly act,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, whose husband, USS Vincennes Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, on July 3 gave the order to fire on the jetliner when it was misidentified by ship radar operators as an attacking Iranian warplane. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> vowed revenge. `` Together as a community we have to find out who it is so that -LRB- a car-bombing -RRB- does n't happen to anybody else,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said in a videotaped interview for Crime Stoppers. `` It could be me last week, you tomorrow,'' she said. The spot, which is intended to help find witnesses, includes a re-enactment of Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> scrambling out of her van seconds before it burst into flames. `` My life has been threatened, and that of my family has been threatened,'' she said. `` I have lost my job, I ca n't go back to my home and my life has completely done a turnaround.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' shadow-darkened front is obscured by electronic scrambling in the video, which contains the most extensive public statement she or her husband has made about the bombing. During the interview, not all of which will be shown in the Crime Stoppers segment, Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> describes what happened as she was waiting at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> intersection while driving to work. `` I had been sitting at the red light maybe 20, 30 seconds when I felt that I had been rear-ended ... by a car going very fast,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who was not injured. `` At the same ime, I heard an explosion. I opened up the door. I smelled -LRB- something -RRB- burning. I got my seat belt off as quickly as I could. I jumped out and ran around the back end of the van, where I saw the back third of my van on fire.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> and her husband have been in protected seclusion since the bombing, which the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is investigating. Possible motives that agents have said they're checking include retaliation for the downed Iranian airliner. A week after the bombing, Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was dismissed from her job of 12 years at La Jolla Country Day School, which was the target the same week of a telephoned bomb threat that turned out to be a hoax. In a letter received Saturday by parents of students at the exclusive private school, Headmaster <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was not allowed to return partly because of concerns that her presence would create a military atmosphere and disrupt the campus' learning environment Crime Stoppers is a non-profit organization that works with law enforcement agencies to offer rewards to people who provide anonymous tips that help solve crimes featured in weekly segments shown on local television stations as a public service. A total of $ 37,000 has been pledged to the reward fund in the <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> case, including $ 25,000 from an anonymous <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> developer and $ 1,000 from the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> crew, said <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartmill </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> chapter of Crime Stoppers.

 People who were outraged over an art exhibit that featured a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag on the floor now can get some measure of revenge: They can walk on a likeness of the artist at another exhibit. The new piece was put together by a junior high school art teacher who was angered by the original by student `` Dread'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> of the School of the Art Institute of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The protest exhibit features a life-size sketch of Tyler drawn on cloth in the manner of a police outline of a homicide victim. The cloth is on the floor and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag hangs above it on a wall of a small North Side museum. Viewers are encouraged to step on the sketch of <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>'s face while they write comments on `` How to Display ` Dread' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>.'' The original work, part of a minority students' exhibit that is now closed, was titled `` What is the Proper Way to Display a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Flag?'' It featured a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag positioned on the floor in front of a book asking viewers to write their opinions about how the flag should be displayed. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>'s display touched off several protests, including one attended by 2,500 veterans and supporters that led to the arrests of four people. Art Institute officials defended the flag display and the student's right to freedom of expression. But veterans and protesters succeeded in temporarily shutting down the exhibit several times. It closed March 16 after a month of controversy. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> could not be reached for comment on the protest exhibit. He has an unlisted telephone number. `` I was upset by seeing my flag on the floor,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, 33, the art teacher from suburban <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>. As he spoke, visitors walked over his work at the cramped, storefront <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION>. One visitor to <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s work, wrote, `` An artist he is not, this Dread <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. He is an unpatriotic snot. He knows not what this country is about.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Museum owner <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertel </PERSON> said he contacted <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> and asked him to exhibit the display at his museum after hearing news reports on it. `` It showed contempt for the artist who showed contempt for the flag,'' said <PERSON> Hertel </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, who said he graduated from the School of the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in 1976, plans to move the exhibit to various Veterans of Foreign Wars' halls around the state.

<HEAD>Aquino Says Communists Can Serve If Freely Elected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said today on the eve of nationwide village elections that pro-Communist candidates who are voted into office in the balloting can serve if they are freely and fairly chosen. The military claims the rebels will use the vote to expand their base. Also today, the rebels claimed they have recovered from setbacks suffered during Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s administration, and police said three men shot up the home of an anti-communist activist near <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION>, killing three people, including the man's wife. On Tuesday, voters in the country's 42,000 villages, or `` barangays,'' will select about 287,567 local council members. The military claims the rebels are backing pro-Marxist candidates in hopes of solidifying their control in thousands of rural villages. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was asked if the government would prevent rebel supporters from claiming council seats. The Communist Party of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is banned, but Tuesday's balloting is supposed to be non-partisan. `` Well, if they have been elected legitimately, there has been no force, they will hold office,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told reporters. `` We have to abide by the law.'' Col. <PERSON> Gerardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, intelligence chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, said the rebels hope to capture 60 percent of the village council seats in areas under their control. The rebels claim to control about 8,500 villages nationwide. But the Commission on Election puts the figure at about 2,800. The difference is believed to be in definitions of `` control.'' `` In remote, inaccessible areas, there is hardly any government presence,'' said election commissioner <PERSON> Haydee </PERSON> <PERSON> Yorac </PERSON>. `` So the party members are the ones who exercise the most serious influence.'' <PERSON> Hilario </PERSON> <PERSON> Davide </PERSON>, chairman of the election commission, said troops would be deployed in about 3,500 districts considered `` hot spots.'' In a statement marking Wednesday's 20th anniversary of the communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, rebel Chief of Staff <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> claimed a force of 30,000 fighters deployed in 65 of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' 73 provinces, 800 of 1,500 cities and 12,000 villages and neighborhoods. `` NPA units have largely recovered from setbacks in 1985 and 1986 and have reconstituted guerrilla formations which had been reduced for a time,'' <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> said. Civilian and military authorities claim the rebels are losing strength because of more effective counterinsurgency operations and improvements in the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> economy. They also maintain that the rebels lost much of their appeal following the February 1986 ouster of President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' authoritarian administration and the rise of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has vowed to crush the insurgents before her term expires in 1992. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was founded on March 29, 1969 by leftist intellectuals and remnants of the pro-Soviet HUK guerrillas, who waged an unsuccessful insurgency in the 1950s and 1960s. <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> was captured in March 1987 but escaped last year from the stockade at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s Camp Crame after attending a birthday party for his former jailer. In <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION>, 350 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, police and witnesses said gunmen late Sunday sprayed semi-automatic rifle fire on the home of <PERSON> Rogelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Nara </PERSON>, 37, in the village of <LOCATION> Kan-Irag </LOCATION> in the mountains above the city. <LOCATION> Nara </LOCATION>'s wife and two male relatives were killed and two others were wounded, including <LOCATION> Nara </LOCATION>'s nine-year-old daughter, police said. <LOCATION> Nara </LOCATION> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reforms </ORGANIZATION>, one of hundreds of government-backed anti-communist vigilante groups operating nationwide. Police said the attackers could have been rebels or relatives of a man killed by <LOCATION> Nara </LOCATION> several years ago.

<HEAD>Dollar Up In Japan, Stocks Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose against the Japanese yen today, while stock prices lost ground on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar closed at 132.30 yen, up 1.03 yen from last Friday's close The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency opened at 131.68 yen and moved in a range of 131.67-132 .30 yen The dollar opened slightly higher than last Friday's close of 131.27 yen, but active buying of the dollar by insurance companies pushed it further, currency dealers said. They attributed the dollar's bullishness to the market's reduced wariness toward rising interest rates. `` There seem to be no strong incentive to sell the dollar right now,'' said <PERSON> Masato </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanjo </PERSON>, a dealer at the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> office of Manufacture Hanover Trust. `` The bullish dollar appears to have become more like a long-term trend.'' Another currency dealer with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> said there was some demand for the dollar in early trading but otherwise the market was `` very quiet'' as most overseas markets were observing a three-day Easter holiday from last Friday. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 20.14-point loser last Friday, shed another 56.12 points, or 0.18 percent, to close at 31,512.40. On the stock market, dealers said the anticipation of the introduction of the capital-gain tax starting April 1 led to heavy sale of shares, resulting in a lower Nikkei index. Investors currently pay a 0.55-percent securities tax when selling shares, but from April 1, they will pay 1.3 percent in taxes _ 1 percent in capital gain tax and 0.3 percent for the securities tax. Also, in anticipation of the indictment of former chairan of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for bribery charges in a stock-trading scandal, <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> shares closed at an all time low of 1.53 million yen. Its previous low was 1.58 million marked on last Wednesday. But dealers expressed optimism, saying market environments are not as bad as the Nikkei indicates. `` The fact that Nikkei fell only less than 0.2 percent despite all the bad news indicates the deep-down bullishness of the market,'' said a dealer at a major brokerage in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` Once all the bad news is out, it will be time for the spring rally.''

<HEAD>More Space Chicks to Hatch Later This Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An experiment scientists hope will shed light on the cause of motion sickness in zero gravity and the loss of bone mass in astronauts continues this week as more `` space chicks'' hatch. The first of a group of baby chicks to hatch from eggs that took a five-day space ride aboard the space shuttle Discovery pecked through his shell Friday night at <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> headquarters here. <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> is the sponsor of the experiment that is the brainchild of <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> senior <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vellinger </PERSON>. The first space chick hatched less than a week after the eggs took their ride. Seven more space chicks and eight from a control group that remained on the ground also hatched Friday and Saturday. Another eight eggs that traveled in space and eight more control eggs are to hatch this Saturday. <PERSON> Vellinger </PERSON> said the experiment was designed to measure the effects of a weightless environment on embryo development. Vellinger, 23, designed an incubator that was launched aboard Discovery on March 13. It carried 32 chicken eggs. A similar incubator with a control group of 32 eggs was kept on the ground during the period that Discovery was in space. Vellinger and a group of scientific advisers will study the chicks during the next year and then prepare a paper assessing the results. The other half of the 64 eggs _ from space and the control group _ were opened by <PERSON> Vellinger </PERSON> and his five advisers after the shuttle landed to examine the embryos at that stage in their development. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hullinger </PERSON>, a professor of veterinary medicine at <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION>, said it is possible the experiment could provide clues about human reproduction during generations-long voyages as well as the differences in cartilage, bone, tissue and internal organs between the space chicks and their Earthbound contemporaries.

<HEAD>Sheriff's Department To Comply With Grand Jury Recommendations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Sheriff's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to comply with grand jury recommendations for ending abuse of jail inmates by a so-called `` Rambo Squad'' that allegedly stripped, chained and beat inmates, a spokesman said. The grand jury investigated allegations by more than 100 people who said they had been abused or held naked in jail cells after being arrested for misdemeanor offenses which usually were alcohol-related. No indictments were issued, but the panel's report, released last week following a nine-month investigation, criticized <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> and his top assistants for failing to provide the leadership to stop a group of deputies at the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cajon </ORGANIZATION> jail from preying on inmates. The grand jury found that the deputies found `` delight in cruelty to others.'' The panel also cited coverups and mismanagement by jail supervisors, and said many deputies looked the other way while inmates were being assaulted or harassed. Department spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulmer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> has reviewed the 20-page report and `` there is absolutely nothing he disagrees with.'' `` He thinks all the recommendations are good, and he would like to implement them as soon as possible,'' <PERSON> Fulmer </PERSON> said. The panel's recommendations include the creation of an Inspections and Control Division; a strengthening of the department's Internal Affairs Division; required filing of detailed reports of physical confrontations between prisoners and deputies; and tougher standards for the selection and performance of jail training officers.

 Abandoning hopes that raucous spring break festivities might subside, police called in more patrols over the Easter weekend, made hundreds of arrests and braced for a second wave of vacationing students. `` We've got some tired officers,'' Sgt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said early today. Rest appears out of the question anytime soon as vacation schedules call for a new load of college and high school students this week, he said. `` USC -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> and others are heading into town apparently,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. `` We had hoped it was over with.'' The first phase of the annual rite of spring has already left the desert resort town 110 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> littered with beer bottles, cans and other trash, he said. During the 10-day period beginning March 17, three people died in traffic accidents and a 19-year-old woman was injured when she fell from the balcony of a hotel. Arrests reached 1,640 over the weekend. Charges ranged from drunken driving to assault. Officers have handed out an estimated 6,000 traffic citations, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said.

 Children hunted for eggs and Americans paraded under mostly sunny skies to celebrate Easter, while services around the nation echoed with more somber calls to remember the homeless and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Glide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> served a home-cooked breakfast to about 100 homeless people and poor children dressed up in frilly Easter dresses and stylish blue jeans donated by the church. Afterward, they hunted for Easter eggs. `` It's all for the kids,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Near <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Bede </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest who describes himself as a traveling Franciscan preacher, set up a shrine in his home in <LOCATION> Clifton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` We have photos of each American hostage on display and the number of days they've been in captivity. We have an empty basket which symbolizes that their baskets are empty this Easter,'' he said. A more light-hearted atmosphere swept along <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Fifth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, where thousands enjoyed sunny 60-degree weather and promenaded in the annual Easter parade <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerstens </PERSON> attracted a crowd with a 6-pound, 4-foot-tall bonnet that was a basket of silk flowers _ lilies, apple blossoms and forsythia. In the nation's capital, President and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended a christening at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alban </LOCATION>'s Chapel for their latest grandchild, <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was born Feb. 7 to the Bushes' son <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, crowds at the <ORGANIZATION> Biblical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> walked through a life-size reproduction of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s Gate at <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> and Christ's tomb. `` Easter is about the resurrection of <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> and the fact that he died for all of us who believe in him. It's not about the bunny and the painted eggs,'' said <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Roese </PERSON>, the non-denominational center's director. Nonetheless, more than 20,000 people flocked to a farm in Homer, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, to hunt for about 140,000 dyed hens' eggs and candy eggs in what was said to be the world's largest Easter egg hunt. A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor laid a 5-inch-long, 10-ounce Easter egg. Officials at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo spotted the blue egg shortly after sunrise. `` What an Easter egg!,'' exclaimed zoo spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>. `` If fertile, God willing, it will hatch in 54 to 58 days.'' Only one of the endangered condors has ever been conceived in captivity.

 Syrian and Christian army gunners hammered each other's positions in and around <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today after random bombardment of the capital forced residents to spend the Easter holiday underground. Police said three civilians were killed and 13 wounded in the hostilities overnight and during the morning. The casualties raised the toll to 97 dead and 339 wounded since the latest round of fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war broke out March 8. The rocket and artillery barrages in the capital tapered off at daybreak. But heavy duels resounded in the mountains overlooking <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, police said. It was the fourth consecutive night that barrages on both Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> have confined civilians to basements and bomb shelters. The Syrians and their allies have also ordered a blockade of east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and nearby Christian communities, home of about 1 million people. Syrian forces and allied Druse gunners pounded east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with rocket barrages of up to 60 rounds per minute during the night. The bombardment set fires at a fuel tank at the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> port and the city's main power plant, police said. The Christian army units retaliated with barrages from 155mm howitzers. Until the damaged plant is repaired, authorities will be able to provide electricity for just four hours a day. The fighting pits army Commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> units against an alliance of Syrian troops and militiamen of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> contends the Syrians, who intervened 13 years ago as peacekeepers, have turned into an occupation force by taking sides with Moslems and Druse. He heads a Christian military Cabinet in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s divided government. Syrians back the rival Moslem government. The Christian leader has declared a `` war of liberation'' to drive out the 40,000 Syrian troops. He has vowed to fight on even at the risk of destroying <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, today rejected <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s accusations. `` The Syrian army entered <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1976 at the request of the then reigning Lebanese government. This request was later endorsed by the Arab League, of which <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is a founding member,'' <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said. He said any demand for a Syrian pullout should be made by a united <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> government `` which is not present at the moment.'' The latest violence began after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> imposed a blockade on milita-run ports. The militias skim taxes that would otherwise go to the government.

 Political manuevering in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> over `` who is a Jew'' has left a painful legacy among American Jews, who in a survey more often perceived unfairness to Conservative and Reform Jews than to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> Arabs. The American <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> study revealed support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was as strong as ever, but it also showed that widespread discontent was sown when attempts were made to amend <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Law of Return to deny non-Orthodox converts an automatic right to Israeli citizenship. The study also provided new evidence of a growing activism among American Jews toward their spiritual homeland, according to some observers. A majority, 54 percent, of the survey said they had spoken critically of attempts to change the law. A third said they would be less likely to make political or charitable contributions to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> if the law is changed to exclude converts from Reform and <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>, branches to which more than 80 percent of American Jews affiliated to a synagogue belong. `` I think the effect is kind of a contingent, or sleeper, effect,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Queens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, who conducted the survey for the committee's <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on American Jewish-Israeli Relations. `` This precedent will allow American Jews to forcefully and pointedly disagree'' on other issues involving <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The attempt to define Jewishness provided an `` emotional vent'' to American Jews already concerned about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s response to the Palestinian uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Gunther </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, a media consultant to the Rabbinical Assembly and other Jewish groups. `` I think that this is a family squabble that is erupting above the surface,'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said. `` American Jews and Diaspora Jews are no longer content with being checkbook Jews only.'' Orthodox religious parties, which do not recognize the validity of conversions performed by Conservative and Reform rabbis, have long sought to change the Law of Return, but the issue heated up last year when they emerged as power brokers because neither of the two major Israeli parties, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, won a majority in elections. Both parties indicated a willingness to negotiate on the Law of Return issue in return for the help of the religious parties in forming a coalition government. The committee's poll, conducted among 944 Jews in January and February, was not a random sample and provided no measure of its sampling error. But <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said participants were demographically representative of the American-Jewish community. The questions were mailed to Jews on a list compiled by Market Facts, a research company. The findings indicated the issue struck hard and close to home: _ Two-thirds said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would be declaring Conservative and <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> illegitimate if the Law of Return were changed to recognize only conversions performed by Orthodox rabbis _ Three-quarters said they would be upset if the law were changed to recognize only Orthodox conversion, and more than half saying they would be `` very upset. _ Thirty-seven percent said they would be less likely to make contributions to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION>, and 31 percent said they would be less likely to contribute to pro-Israel political candidates if the law were changed <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said he was shocked that respondents were more upset with the Law of Return issue than with the Palestinian uprising on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where more than 400 Palestinians and 17 Israelis have died during the past 15 months. For example, 39 percent of the respondents said Conservative and Reform Jews are treated unfairly in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, while slightly less than a third of the respondents said Arabs on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> are treated unfairly. While some Orthodox leaders in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have tried to downplay the political consequences of changing the law, the survey confirmed it is a grass-roots issue, said one of the American-Jewish leaders who urged <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials to retain the present law. `` It's natural and understandable they should react with great fury,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoffie </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zionists </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` They sense the Jewish state is proclaiming their Judaism to be illegitimate.'' The issue has faded into the background recently as Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> were able to form a coalition government, but American-Jewish leaders are already preparing to fight the battle again. <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, executive vice president of the Jewish committee, said, `` American Jews are at this stage regrouping,'' and have shared the survey results with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials.

 The earthquake that shuddered across <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> on that Good Friday packed so strong a punch that it knocked out a seismograph in Fairbanks. It took a seismologist at a small college in Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, to warn the world of what was to come. `` It could cause great devastation,'' <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisele </PERSON> predicted. `` You can expect tidal waves from this one.'' The earthquake had been felt by <PERSON> Eisele </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Spring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> seismograph. It said the temblor was centered about 3,600 miles northwest of Mobile, in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> or near <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. At 8.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, the 1964 earthquake was one of the strongest on record. In the words of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey: `` The entire earth vibrated like a tuning fork.'' The quake started at 5:36 p.m. <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> on March 27. Centered under a glaciated peninsula 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, it altered 100,000 square miles of landscape. Along a 600-mile arc from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yakataga </LOCATION> on the eastern <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Trinity </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> southwest of <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION>, the land to the north subsided by as much as six feet; to the south it rose by as much as 50 feet. Land shifted horizontally as much as 70 feet in several places south of <LOCATION> Seward </LOCATION>, tangling railroad tracks, splitting roads, yanking down buildings. Property damage exceeded $ 311 million. The earthquake and the seismic sea waves it spawned killed 114 people in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. More than a dozen others died at <LOCATION> DePoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Crescent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, when seismic waves crashed ashore at those communities. In the aftermath came the stories of the lucky and the luckless. Often, merest circumstance determined who died and who survived. In <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON> had just parked his car outside the new <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> when he felt a jolt. He stepped from his car ready to have words with another driver. `` I thought some stupid jerk had rammed me from behind,'' says <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON>, managing editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. As he got out, a huge slab of the building crashed down, flattening his car. Nine people in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> were n't so lucky. In <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, many residents had turned out as usual to watch the freighter <LOCATION> Chena </LOCATION> disgorge its cargo. The arrival of the 400-foot ship always was something special for <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> folks, and on this day _ typically _ a crowd was on hand as longshoremen unloaded the vessel. In an eternity that lasted only moments, <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> was shaken unmercifully, and the <LOCATION> Chena </LOCATION> began wallowing insanely, snapping her mooring lines. The dock heaved, rocked, shook and then pitched into the water, carrying onlookers and warehouses. The <LOCATION> Chena </LOCATION> survived; the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> waterfront and most of the business district were obliterated by collapsing ground and seismic waves. Thirty-one people died. In <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Holm </PERSON> and his son were fishing for herring from a skiff in the harbor. <PERSON> Holm </PERSON> could not understand why he suddenly lost control of the small boat. `` I just could n't make it respond. It kept bouncing, bouncing,'' he says. When the movement subsided, <PERSON> Holm </PERSON> headed to the dock. He and his son, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, helped secure several fishing boats which had broken loose. He checked the lines of his own 72-foot <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. The level of water in the harbor started fluctuating wildly, and then <PERSON> Holm </PERSON> heard `` the terrible roar of water coming up the channel, the frightening noise of docks and buildings collapsing.'' The Holms sprinted for shore as the dock creaked and groaned under the pressure of the rising water. At the head of the dock, <PERSON> Holm </PERSON> fought the impulse to seek safety atop an eight-foot wooden tank used to keep crabs alive. He and his son raced about 150 yards farther to the base of Pillar Mountain, the hill which forms <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION>'s backdrop. With the sound of bedlam in the harbor behind them, they clawed their way up the steep slope to an elevation of about 150 feet. <PERSON> Holm </PERSON> was too exhausted to go farther. He told his son to go on, but the boy stayed with his father. The two watched in awe as huge waves battered <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> for six hours. The city lost most of its seafood processing industry, 75 percent of its business district and half its fishing fleet _ including the good ship <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. The wooden crab tank vanished. Nineteen people died. In <ORGANIZATION> Chenega </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Avis </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was preparing to take a bath when the tiny Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> village began shaking. She scooped up her two sons, and dashed up a forest trail to the safety of a high knoll. Behind her she could hear the sound of waves estimated up to 80 feet tall smashing the village only 70 miles from the quake's epicenter Of the 20 buildings in the town, only the school was spared. Twenty-three people died, including <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s daughter, parents, a grandmother, an uncle and an aunt. `` I had horrible, horrible nightmares for almost 20 years,'' she says. `` Always they were the same. I would be climbing up and up, and the waves would be creeping higher and higher.''

<HEAD>Abortion Rallies Over, Operation Rescue Leader Jailed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 More than 300 anti-abortion protesters remained in jail this morning, where their leader claimed police used excessive force in making arrests and accused the media of a `` pro-death'' bias. The Operation Rescue protesters spent Easter behind bars, sometimes singing hymns, refusing to take the legal steps that would have allowed them to leave jail because they wanted to dramatize their cause. The group's jailed leader, <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, spent part of the day calling journalists to complain that they failed to show pictures of aborted fetuses that might show the public what abortion really entails. He opened the New York-based group's Holy Week protests Thursday by appearing at a news conference with a small, white coffin that contained what he said was an aborted 19-week-old fetus. After opening the coffin lid he left, challenging the media to televise the remains. `` The media is the greatest perpetrator of this holocaust because they're hiding the truth from the public,'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> said Sunday. `` It's not a matter of taste. The majority of the media elite are pro-death and reduce this to a war of words, and it's a war of bodies, dead bodies.'' The protesters are the latest of more than 21,000 to be arrested nationally since 1987, mostly for blocking clinics where abortions are performed. As part of their effort to focus attention on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s reconsideration of its 1973 decision legalizing abortion, 252 men and at least 50 women stayed in jail Sunday by refusing to provide their names to police or to sign misdemeanor trespassing citations. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, a former car salesman, and three others could face more serious charges: They remained jailed today for investigation of felony conspiracy to encourage others to commit a crime. `` This felony charge is a joke,'' he said. `` How can you have a felony conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor trespass? That's ludicrous. He alleged <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police used excessive force when they arrested 750 protesters during a six-hour standoff outside a clinic Saturday. More than 1,000 anti-abortion activists were arrested during three days of protests in Cypress, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Officers' treatment of protesters, he charged, `` was completely uncalled for and unprofessional. You do n't twist people's arms to the point were they're screaming in pain and sticking two fingers up their nose.'' One demonstrator's arm and wrist were broken in a scuffle with police Saturday, Operation Rescue said. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said Sunday that the group was exaggerating the incidents. Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said officers used a `` pain compliance hold'' in the arrests. And he said he would ask the city attorney to sue Operation Rescue for the $ 60,000 to $ 100,000 the demonstration cost the city.

<HEAD>Federal Reserve Bank Sees Surplus Due To Drug Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The cash surplus at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> here has jumped from $ 165 million in 1985 to $ 3.8 billion in 1988, and authorities believe the 23-fold increase is largely because of laundered drug money moving through banks. `` It is a good indicator that we are awash with dope money being laundered through <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, not just from the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area but from elsewhere in the country,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said. `` Staggering amounts of cash are being funneled into the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area for laundering here.'' Despite hefty fines levied against some of the state's largest financial institutions, drug officials say the illegal money is being funneled into the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> after being laundered through banks. Laundering is the process of passing money through enough transactions that it is hard to trace. It may arrive at a bank as a legitimate business deposit. The money may then be transferred to foreign bank accounts controlled by drug kingpins without traffickers having to smuggle cash out of the country. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, which had a reputation of being the hub for drug laundering, saw its Federal Reserve surplus drop from a high of $ 6 billion in 1985 to $ 4.8 billion in 1988, still the largest surplus in the country. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lochridge </PERSON> said the trend `` validates <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> as the new money-laundering and drug financial center in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The Federal Reserve System is the nation's central bank, managing the money supply by controlling how much cash member banks must keep liquid instead of loaning out. About 40 percent of the nation's banks belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>. When deposits at a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> district branch exceed the branch's cash shipments back to its member banks, that district is said to have a cash surplus. Only 10 of the 35 branches of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> reported cash surpluses last year. After <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the others are <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, with a $ 1.9 billion surplus; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, $ 511 million; <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, $ 484 million; <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, $ 399 million; <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, $ 367 million; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, $ 118 million; <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, $ 45 million; and <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, $ 15 million.

The governing party finished third in the provincial assembly elections behind the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Populist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the chief opposition group, and the conservative <ORGANIZATION> True </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of former six-time Premier <PERSON> Suleyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Demirel </PERSON>, according to nearly complete tallies provided by state radio and the <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> news agency. Opposition parties described Sunday's elections as a referendum on <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s free-market economic policies. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> had said he would quit if opposition gains were large enough to make it difficult for him to govern. But today, <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> said he would stay on until the next elections scheduled for 1992. `` he nation gave us a mandate until 1992, we will be serving the nation until then,'' the 61-year-old premier told a news conference `` The people knew the party in power would not change as a result of these elections. They wanted to give us a message: to bring down inflation faster,'' <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> said. He said `` A little warning was intended by the voters but it went a bit too far.'' <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> promised changes in the Cabinet sometime this week. Voters elected more than 326,000 mayors, provincial assembly members, city council members, village leaders and neighborhood representatives. In the provincial assembly elections, the Social Democrats gained 28 percent of the nationwide vote, and the True Path had 25.5 percent, the returns showed. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s party was in third place with 22 percent. Among the smaller parties, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of former Premier <PERSON> Bulent </PERSON> <PERSON> Ecevit </PERSON> got 9 percent, the Moslem fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Prosperity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 9.5 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 4.5 percent, the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Reformist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 1 percent, and the rest was scattered among independent candidates. <PERSON> Demirel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> should quit because of the results. `` He said he would pack up and go, and if he is true to his word, he should do so,'' <PERSON> Demirel </PERSON> told reporters. `` I am sure he will not try to run the country on support based on 22 percent of the votes.'' <PERSON> Erdal </PERSON> <PERSON> Inonu </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Populist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, also claimed a win over the <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Inonu </PERSON>, a nuclear physics professor turned politician, declared, `` The people accomplished a real spring cleaning, making it clear who they wanted to see in power.'' Several Motherland members asked for early parliamentary elections. `` Not early but immediate elections should be held,'' said <PERSON> Fahrettin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON>, minister of energy. Five years ago in local assembly elections, <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> gained 41 percent of the vote, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Populists </ORGANIZATION> won 22 percent, and the True Path won 13 percent. The rest of the votes were divided between three other parties. On Sunday, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> won 30 mayorships out of 53 already decided; the <ORGANIZATION> True </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> won 15 and the Motherland party won three. In the last local elections, the <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> captured 54 mayorships in the 67 provincial capitals. Also on the ballots Sunday were mayor's races in 1,917 small towns. Social Democrat candidates ousted <LOCATION> Motherland </LOCATION> mayors in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s three largest cities: <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Izmir </LOCATION> Political analysts attributed <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s loss to inflation, which reached 75 percent last year, his family's high-spending lifestyle, charges of nepotism, and allegations of corruption in high places. Ballots are counted by hand. Complete unofficial results are not expected until Tuesday.

 Media reports said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s navy seized a yacht with as many as five members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s royal family and four Britons aboard, but officials in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> denied knowledge of the incident. Diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> said Iranians have told them the vessel was taken when it strayed into Iranian waters, but that `` the boat and its occupants have been released.'' Media reports said members of the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> royal family were aboard the boat, but one diplomatic source said he was told by an Iranian diplomat that no <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> royal family members were aboard. Diplomatic sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the boat had four British male crew and technicians and two prominent Arabs. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not elaborate on their identity. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> made no public comment on the reports, which surfaced Sunday in a report by the Kuwaiti newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper reported the yacht was seized by the Iranians in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on Thursday while sailing from <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The Independent Television News of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> quoted diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> as saying the royal family members were <PERSON> Kuwaitis </PERSON> and the four Britons were women. The British <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said: `` All our investigations and inquiries have drawn a complete blank.'' Asked whether that meant no yacht was seized, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said: `` Not that we can tell.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity. Officials in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> also denied knowledge of the reported seizure. Shipping executives and fishermen in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> have referred to cases of `` piracy'' in which they say Iranians have captured at least two expensive boats in recent months. The boats' occupants reportedly were free unharmed.

<HEAD>Court Will Decide Liquor-Labeling Issue in North Dakota Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether states may impose labelng and reporting requirements on liquor sold at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases within their borders. The court said it will review a ruling that such <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> regulation of liquor sold at two military bases in that state violates federal policy. A <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> law requires all liquor sold in the state to be distributed through a state-controlled system. State officials sought to require out-of-state liquor distributors to put a label on each bottle sold at the Grand Forks and <ORGANIZATION> Minot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Bases. The labels were to say the liquor is for consumption only at the military installations. The state also wanted suppliers to report monthly on how much liquor they shipped into the state. The rules were designed to prevent liquor intended for the two military enclaves from being sold elsewhere in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. The federal government challenged the regulations, arguing they violated a federal policy aimed at assuring liquor sold at clubs and stores on military bases would be purchased by the government for the lowest possible price. Profits from the military base sales are used to pay for recreational activities. Federal officials said it could cost the government $ 200,000 to $ 250,000 more each year if the labeling and reporting regulations were enforced in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. They said the rules would force them to purchase more liquor from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> distributors at higher prices. The 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last September that the state regulations must give way to the federal policy. The appeals court rejected the state's argument that it was empowered to impose the regulations by the 21st Amendment to the Constitution, which repealed Prohibition and gave states sweeping control over liquor distribution. `` We conclude that the 21st Amendment provides no basis for regulating the means by which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has sought to order military liquor procurement and to provide for the welfare and morale activities of military personnel,'' the appeals court said. The National Beer Wholesalers' Association supported <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s appeal. The association said there is `` uncontradicted evidence ... that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> was seriously concerned about the problem of diversion of liquor from military reservations.'' The case is <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-926.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said today some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were ill-informed about human rights questions in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and threatened progress toward close bilateral relations. On Sino-Soviet relations, meanwhile, <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> told reporters that even after Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in May, there will be some way to go before differences between the two countries are resolved. Since diplomatic ties were formed a decade ago, relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` enjoy vast potential and the prospects are very good,'' <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said. But he warned against interference in Chinese internal matters that he said `` was not in the interest of friendly relations.'' <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> called for a `` new pattern'' of relations based on mutual trust, and had sharp words for members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who have criticized <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s lack of democratic reform and its human rights record in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. `` A small number of people in the American <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are actually very ill-informed about the situation in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. They have very strong prejudice.'' The Chinese government last week criticized both the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for statements over the declaration of martial law in the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> following pro-independence riots there this month. Human rights, <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said, are a matter of basic questions such as providing adequate food and education and `` are inseparable with the actual condition of the country involved.'' He also said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional criticisms of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s family planning policies that try to keep couples from having more than one child were `` fairly absurd.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in recent years has withheld funds for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> family planning programs on the grounds that money going to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> backs up strict birth control policies that have led to forced abortions. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which supports the anti-Vietnamese resistance in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, backs the dispatch of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ends its 10-year occupation. But, he said, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is not preparing to send peace troops to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The question of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> will be high on the agenda when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> meets Chinese leaders in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said. The summit, the first between the two countries in 30 years, will normalize long-strained relations, <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said, but does n't mean that all major obstacles to better relations will be removed. Soviet support for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is regarded by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as the most serious obstacle to better ties between <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Justices Let Stand Damage Award to Former Oregon Medical Examiner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let stand a $ 300,000 award won by <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s former chief medical examiner from the woman who fired him following news reports that he had sold body parts to finance parties in the morgue. The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments by <PERSON> Kristine </PERSON> <PERSON> Gebbie </PERSON>, administrator of the State Health Division, aimed at overturning the award won by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. A federal jury ruled that <PERSON> Gebbie </PERSON> deprived <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> of his constitutionally protected liberty interests without due process of law when she fired him in 1985. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> had maintained a bank account, in his name but with the knowledge of everyone in his office, for money paid for pituitary glands and other body parts removed during autopsies in the state coroner's office. The money was used for various amenities in the medical examiner's office. When <PERSON> Gebbie </PERSON> announced <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s firing on Oct. 3, 1985, she issued a press release in which she said <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> had `` knowingly violated public trust and confidence'' through his `` systematic 16-year diversion of public funds.'' In upholding the jury verdict last Oct. 31, the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> presented undisputed evidence that <PERSON> Gebbie </PERSON> charged him with: _ Violating the public trust _ Diverting state funds for his own use _ Establishing a `` slush fund. _ Causing the state to be billed for toxicological reports made in connection with private autopsies he performed The appeals court added, `` There was sufficient evidence presented from which a jury could reasonably infer that the charges were both contested and false.'' In the appeal acted on today, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> Solicitor General <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Linder </PERSON> argued for <PERSON> Gebbie </PERSON> that the appeals court ruling places government employers in an `` untenable position.'' The appeal said the 9th Circuit court's ruling gives no clear guidelines for `` government's responsiveness to the performance of its high-level officials and its ability to speak to the public it serves.'' The appeal also contended that <PERSON> Gebbie </PERSON> was entitled to qualified immunity from <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s lawsuit because `` she acted in unquestioned good faith and the law concerning liberty interests and name-clearing hearings is far from settled.'' The case is <PERSON> Gebbie </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, 88-1299.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact Dismissal of Suit Against Pennsylvania Newspapers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to review a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> judge's lawsuit against two newspapers that reported on what was to have been a confidential state investigation of him. The court, without comment, let stand rulings that dismissed state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON>'s suit against The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Gazette </ORGANIZATION>. As a result of various articles appearing in both newspapers about <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON>, the state's <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquiry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> began an investigation in mid-1982. In his suit, <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> said the articles portrayed him as being involved in `` political activity, racism, favoritism and influence-peddling.'' Completed in May 1983, the state board's investigation exonerated <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> of any wrongdoing. During the investigation, both newspapers published reports about the board's supposedly secret proceedings. Some articles even contained excerpts of hearing transcripts. Those reports were the basis of <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON>'s suit, in which he charged the newspapers with obtaining the transcripts illegally and publishing only selected excerpts that placed him in a false light. The suit, which sought monetary damages, also claimed that the articles invaded <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON>'s privacy and violated the confidentiality provisions of state law. A state trial judge dismissed most of the lawsuit's counts, and that dismissal was upheld by a state appeals court. The appeals court relied heavily on a 1978 ruling by the nation's highest court in a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> case. In that decision, the justices said the free-press protections in the Constitution's First Amendment mean newspapers can not be criminally punished for publishing truthful information about secret governmental proceedings. The decision struck down a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law that made it a crime to report about a state judicial commission's confidential investigations into judges' fitness to hold office. The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> appeals court ruled that allowing <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON>'s civil suit would, like <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s criminal law, violate free-press rights `` The imposition of monetary damages -LRB- civil sanctions -RRB- can be just as inimical to and an encroachment of one's First Amendment guarantees as criminal sanctions,'' the state court said. The <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to hear <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON>'s ensuing appeal last Oct. 31. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> argued that the state courts wrongly concluded that the newspapers' free-press rights would be harmed if <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> were allowed to sue over violations of state confidentiality provisions. Lawyers for the newspapers urged the justices to reject the appeal. They noted, among other things, that the state court rulings left <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> free to amend his complaint to explain his assertion that confidential information was obtained `` illegally.'' The case is <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1274.

 The central part of the nation is basking in temperatures more like early summer than early spring as a pair of weather systems pull air up from the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.

 Maverick populist <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> savored his political comeback today as election officials announced he had trounced a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> loyalist for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s sole at-large seat in the new national legislature. `` It's hard to say what my spirit is more full of, joy or concern about what I realistically can do to help Muscovites,'' the 58-year-old <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told several hundred applauding workers at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, where he is first deputy chairman. <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s election commission, said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> won 89.4 percent of the vote Sunday. His opponent, <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON>, received 6.9 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who was ousted as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Communist Party boss in 1987, has accused the party's elite of trying to discredit him and had said he feared votes might be tampered with to cheat him out of victory. The former protege of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> campaigned against the privileges afforded high-ranking Soviet officials and called for faster reforms to improve living standards for everyone. His opponent, <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON>, the 51-year-old director of the ZIL limousine plant, has carefully followed the party line in most matters. The cars made at his factory are a prized perquisite of high-ranking officials. <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON> had said his top priority is to end food shortages by providing more machinery to farmers and improving storage and processing facilities. Large pro-Yeltsin rallies were held in the capital in the closing days of the campaign and the former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party leader became something of a symbol for people expressing a desire for truly representative government. ocal <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> election officials spent all night counting votes after Sunday's election for the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies _ the country's first contested elections in more than 70 years. `` We have been sitting and waiting since last evening for the final votes; we are unshaven and have had no sleep,'' <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubivsky </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Volgograd </LOCATION> district, said by telephone. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudyakov </PERSON>, a city council member, said the votes, initially counted at local election districts, were being recounted at the city election headquarters and the information was fed into computers for final tabulation. He said representatives of <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON> were at the council building to oversee the recount. Of more than 2,000 Soviets interviewed by Western correspondents at polling places after the voting, 1,734 were for <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and 162 for <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON>. Others either refused to disclose how they voted or expressed opposition to either candidate. After casting his ballot, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> claimed many Soviets were worried about voting fraud, and he complained that the elections were not completely democratic. `` People are worried about the election results, worried that there will be deviations at election stations during vote counting,'' he told reporters. `` Everything is troubling them.'' He said the campaign was `` not fully democratic'' but was a `` big step forward'' from previous one-candidate balloting. He said the real test of democracy will be whether the vote count is fair. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who brought <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> into <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership in 1985 and two years later oversaw his ouster on charges of making political mistakes and displaying personal ambition, said criticism of party officials is normal during campaigns.

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government today released a report that accused an aide to Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of links to the assassination of his mother. Officials said investigators later found the aide was not involved. The findings of a special commission report on Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s 1984 slaying were withheld for three years, but a newspaper account of the report prompted opposition legislators to demand its release. When <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> initially refused, opposition legislators walked out of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and some were suspended for a week for misbehavior. The commission report, released to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, accused <PERSON> Rajendra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s personal secretary, of facilitating the assassination. But it added: `` The possiblity of someone else being involved along with Mr. <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON> can not be excluded.'' A government memorandum also released today said investigators had checked the accusations and found <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON> `` had no hand in the conspiracy for the assassination of Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and that there was nothing to indicate that Mr. <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON> was in any way involved in the crime or conspiracy.'' <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON>, 52, left his post shortly after Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s death but returned to government last month as a key adviser to <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. He was not immediately available for comment. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was shot in the garden of her <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> residence by two Sikh bodyguards as she walked to a television interview. One of the Sikhs, <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, was shot and killed by other bodyguards minutes after the assassination, and the other, <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, was convicted of murder and hanged on Jan. 6. A third Sikh, <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, was convicted of conspiracy and also hanged. In releasing the report to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, Home Minister <PERSON> Buta </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said another special investigating team also had `` unraveled a conspiracy.'' He said additional charges would be filed, but did not say when or against whom. According to the report, the commission did not rule out involvement of an unspecified foreign agency that might have used the assassins `` as unwitting instruments.'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has long accused neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of training and arming Sikh militants. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has denied the charge. <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution in 1986 allowing the government to withhold the report in the interest of national security. But on March 14, the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> newspaper published parts of the report that alleged <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON> lied during questioning and gave unconvincing explanations about entries in his diary, including the name of one of Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s assassins. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> released the report only after members of his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> threatened to do so. The government says Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was killed in revenge for an army raid she ordered on the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, the holiest Sikh shrine. At least 1,200 people, many of them Sikhs, were killed in the June 1984 raid, which was aimed at ousting Sikh extremists who had turned the shrine into an armed fortress. Sikh militants began fighting in 1982 for an independent homeland. Sikhs, who comprise 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people, claim discrimination by the Hindus, who make up 80 percent of the population.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main rebel opposition group said today that the sister of its leader, <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajavi </PERSON>, has been executed after being tortured in an Iranian prison. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> had no immediate comment on the allegation. In a statement sent to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, or the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warriors </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Monireh </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajavi </PERSON> was arrested with her husband, <PERSON> Asghar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazemi </PERSON>, in 1982. The statement said the couple's only offense was that the woman was the sister of Rajavi, who in addition to being the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahadeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>'s leader, also is commander of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of Iranian dissident factions based in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. It said <PERSON> Nazemi </PERSON> was executed in 1985 and his wife was tortured for several years before being executed. She was 38 years old, the statement said. The rebels did not identify the prison where she was held or give the date and method of the alleged execution. Iranians usually execute women by firing squads. Men are usually hanged. The <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION> statement said the couple has two daughters but it did not say where they live or how old they are. The London-based human rights group, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, as well as other human rights organizations and some governments have condemned <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for executing thousands of political prisoners since August. In that month authorities began a crackdown against dissidents after a cease-fire halted eight years of war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Court Will Restudy Death Penalty Issue in Pennsylvania Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said today it will restudy how far states may go in limiting a jury's discretion to choose life or death for convicted murderers. The court agreed to decide whether <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s death penalty law violates the Constitution by improperly limiting jury discretion. It will hear an appeal by <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Blystone </PERSON>, sentenced to die for a Sept. 9, 1983, murder committed during a robbery. <PERSON> Blystone </PERSON> and three others picked up hitchhiker <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Smithburger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The jury found that <PERSON> Blystone </PERSON> robbed the man of $ 13 and then fatally shot him in the back of the head. The same jury sentencted <PERSON> Blystone </PERSON> to death. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s death penalty statute says, `` The verdict must be a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance ... and no mitigating circumstance.'' The only aggravating factor the jury found was that <PERSON> Blystone </PERSON> killed <PERSON> Smithburger </PERSON> during a felony _ namely robbery. <PERSON> Blystone </PERSON> did not submit any mitigating factors during the sentencing phase of the case. The <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled last October that the state law does not violate the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s prohibition against the mandatory death penalty. The state court said under the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> law `` an individual may thwart the imposition of the death penalty by offering evidence of mitigating circumstances concerning his character, record and the circumstances of the offense. Since -LRB- <PERSON> Blystone </PERSON> -RRB- refused to present any evidence of mitigation, there was nothing to block'' imposition of the death penalty. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1978 said juries may not be precluded from considering mitigating evidence. Lawyers for <PERSON> Blystone </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> law works like a mandatory capital punishment act because the jury is misled into believing it has a moral duty to impose the death penalty in such cases. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> law enforcement officials argued that the state death penalty statute is constitutional because, despite its mandatory language, nothing prevents the defendant from presenting mitigating evidence to offset the presentation of aggravating circumstances. The case is <PERSON> Blystone </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, 88-6222.

 Voters gave populist reformer <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> a resounding victory in his campaign against top-level privilege and economic failures that have emptied Soviet store shelves, according to election results announced today. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> won 89.4 percent of the vote in his race to represent the city he once ran as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, said <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s election commission. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s opponent in Sunday's balloting for a new national legislature, the more traditional party loyalist <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON>, received 6.9 percent of the vote, <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON> told reporters. The 58-year-old <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> had become the most visible symbol of opposition to the party establishment in Sunday's elections _ the first time Soviet voters had a choice of candidates in seven decades. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s race for the sole at-large <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> seat typified the more democratic politics that President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has brought to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> ... was named a People's Deputy of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s city national territorial district No. 1,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. Hundreds of workers applauded <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> today when he spoke the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, where he is first deputy chairman. `` It's hard to say what my spirit is more full of, joy or concern about what I realistically can do to help Muscovites,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> pledged to quit his job in the <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and be a full-time legislator in the new 2,250-seat <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. Voters elected 1,500 deputies Sunday, and the rest are being chosen separately by members of officially-sanctioned organizations. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was fired as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss in November 1987 after criticizing the party's style of leadership and warning that a Stalin-like cult of personality could form around <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He lost his position as a candidate member of the ruling Politburo and was transferred to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He campaigned against the special supplies of food and consumer goods, cars and drivers and other services that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> government and party officials receive, and criticized what he said were economic reform efforts that did not go far enough. In other races in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, reform-economist <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ilya </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaslavsky </PERSON>, an activist for the handicapped, won seats to the congress. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, a historian whose work went against the official grain before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, will face a runoff election. The new congress will meet once a year to choose the country's president and elect about 400 of its own members to a new full-time legislature, the Supreme Soviet <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s campaign drew thousands of enthusiastic supporters who held marches and demonstrations in the weeks just prior to the election. Asked if he had received congratulations from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said, `` that's unlikely, but I would be very happy and thank him from the bottom of my heart.'' He reiterated that he does not see himself as a political opponent of the Soviet leader. In 74 percent of Sunday's races, voters had a choice between two or more candidates, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said. However, 82 percent of the candidates were <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members, the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported, guaranteeing the Communists will dominate the new assembly. Still, this was the first time since the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s earliest days that the people were afforded a choice. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said about 190 million of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 285 million people were eligible to vote. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said more than 80 percent of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s 6.7 million eligible voters took part in the election. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> faced strong challenges from independent candidates in republics like <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> where nationalist sentiments are strong. In the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, the grassroots Sajudis or Lithuanian Restructuring Movement said unofficial returns showed its candidates finished strongly against those endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Sajudis officials claimed their 39 candidates in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s 42 electoral districts either finished first or forced runoff elections in districts where no candidate gained a majority. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who came to power in 1985, is assured of a seat in the new congress, and the elections are unlikely to produce any major upheaval in the power structure. The Soviet president, who with his wife <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> voted at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters Sunday the occasionally boisterous campaign caused by the contested elections was just what the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership wanted `` The electoral law that we passed has justified our hopes,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` It has advanced the political thought and social activity of the people, and this is what we wanted to achieve.'' Elections in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were until Sunday carefully choreographed rituals in which practically all eligible voters were said to turn out and those running got 99.9 percent of the vote. Some Soviets expressed satisfaction at finally having a choice, but there were also objections. `` I think the quality of our leaders will improve because now we have a real democracy,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Valentina </PERSON> <PERSON> Agababova </PERSON> as she sat on a windowsill at voting precinct No. 5 in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION> district, crossing out names of candidates she opposed. But in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gagarin </LOCATION> district, where 12 candidates were running, `` some old people have gotten upset about having so many choices,'' said elections secretary <PERSON> Natalya </PERSON> <PERSON> Safonkina </PERSON>. The last elections in which most Russians had a choice occurred weeks after the November 1917 revolution that swept <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION> to power. The Communists had since allowed just one approved candidate to run for each seat.

 Prosecutors today filed bribery charges against the former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s telecommunications giant, in a stock-trading scandal that has rocked the government <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON> violated laws prohibiting company workers from receiving money and valuables in exchange for favors, the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> public prosecutors office charged today. The affair involves sales by a Tokyo-based information conglomerate, <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, of unlisted shares in a real estate subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, to more than 150 government officials, politicians and executives. Recipients of the shares reaped huge profits after the stock price soared later in over-the-counter trading. Prosecutors also filed today charged <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, former chairman of the information conglomerate, and his aide, <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobayashi </PERSON>, with bribing Shinto. <PERSON> Kobayashi </PERSON> allegedly was involved in financing the transactions as president of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a second Recruit subsidiary. The charges were filed after the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> ended trading today, but share prices of the <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> already had plummeted to an all-time low before the closing. The company was once at the top of the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with total assets estimated at over $ 1 billion. Prosecutors allege Shinto helped Recruit expand its telecommumication business in return for the stocks. Shinto initially denied knowledge of the stock deal but later admitted his involvement and resigned from his position at the head of the telecommunications monopoly. Prosecutors have arrested 12 people on suspicion of giving or taking bribes or violating security laws. At least 17 leading politicians _ including Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> _ have been linked to the scandal, but none has been arrested. Since the scandal surfaced in July, the popularity of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s administration has suffered. Recent polls conducted by major newspapers showed the prime minister's popularity plunged to 15 percent, the lowest level since he took office in 1987. Members of the political opposition have demanded he resign.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let stand a ruling that a public hospital does not violate the constitutionally required separation of church and state by having a chaplain on its payroll. The court, without comment, refused to hear an appeal by three <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> atheists who said taxpayers should not be forced to fund a chaplain's salary at a county-run hospital. The 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last September upheld the employment of a chaplain at <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Broadlawns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>. Three avowed atheists _ <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, his daughter, <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBelle </PERSON> _ said their rights were violated because the government was sponsoring religious activity. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1983 that paying chaplains to lead daily prayers in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and state legislatures does not violate the Constitution. The court cited a long tradition, 200 years old in the case of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, to support its ruling. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> atheists noted that the chaplain at <LOCATION> Broadlawns </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Alzeno </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, was hired in 1985 and her duties are more than ceremonial. A deacon of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> counsels patients, their families and hospital workers and conducts religious services and Bible study classes at the hospital. She is paid $ 23,000 a year. The 8th Circuit court said her duties serve a secular purpose, enhancing the hospital's `` wholistic treatment approach.'' `` The purpose of the chaplaincy was the same as that of the hospital generally, to help patients get well or at least to provide the best care possible for those who would not get well,'' the appeals court said. It added that there was evidence Ms. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' presence did not advance religion unconstitutionally because she refrained from proselytizing _ seeking religious converts. The appeals court also said Ms. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> may have reduced entanglement between the church and state at the hospital because there is less need for hospital officials to supervise volunteer chaplains who worked at <LOCATION> Broadlawns </LOCATION> before she was hired. It is part of Ms. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' job to make sure that the volunteer chaplains are not proselytizing, the appeals court said. It also noted that many patients at the hospital are committed involuntarily or are prisoners treated there. Comparing Ms. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> to a military chaplain, the appeals court said many patients would have no alternative religious counseling if she were not available. The appeals court said, however, that Ms. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> should be permitted to give only secular counseling to hospital employees. In other action, the court: _ Said it will restudy how far states may go in limiting a jury's discretion to choose life or death for convicted murderers. The court agreed to decide whether <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s death penalty law violates the Constitution by improperly limiting jury discretion. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s death penalty statute says: `` The verdict must be a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance ... and no mitigating circumstance.'' _ Refused to review a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> judge's lawsuit against two newspapers that reported on what was to have been a confidential state investigation of him. The court, without comment, let stand rulings that dismissed state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON>'s suit against The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Gazette </ORGANIZATION>. _ Agreed to decide whether states may impose labeling and reporting requirements on liquor sold at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases within their borders. The court said it will review a ruling that such <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> regulations of liquor sold at two military bases in that state violates federal policy. _ Let stand a $ 300,000 award won by <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s former chief medical examiner from the woman who fired him following news reports that he had sold body parts to finance parties in the morgue. The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments by <PERSON> Kristine </PERSON> <PERSON> Gebbie </PERSON>, administrator of the State Health Division, aimed at overturning the award won by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. A federal jury ruled that <PERSON> Gebbie </PERSON> deprived <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> of his constitutionally protected liberty interests without due process of law when she fired him in 1985. The chaplain case is <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Broadlawns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1286.

 The Rev. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>, the preacher <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said she turned to for solace after her sexual encounter with deposed <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, was sentenced today to six months in jail for witness tampering and tax charges. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> had helped put together the case against <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> after being promised immunity from prosecution. Under a plea-bargain agreement, the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> minister also got five years' probation and was also ordered to pay about $ 26,000 in back taxes, interest and fines. He will be required to stay away from <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, his former church secretary. <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>, 52, was sentenced this morning by state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who denied a request from <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Scaring </PERSON>, that the minister be sentenced to community service instead of a jail term. In January, just before his trial was to begin, <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> entered a surprise guilty plea to two of 18 charges against him. He admitted he tried to get <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> to lie to the grand jury about his financial dealings and filed a false 1986 income tax return. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>'s onetime secretary, has said she and he became lovers after her sexual encounter with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> in 1980 because she was emotionally upset about the experience. Two years ago, revelations about the encounter and the money paid to <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> afterward to keep quiet about it toppled <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> from his PTL ministry. Under his plea bargain agreement with state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, charges that <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> had skimmed church funds were dropped. Also, tax evasion charges against his wife, <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON>, were dismissed. About 150 people from <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>'s congregation made the trip from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> to show support for the minister. Some sat in the hallway outside the courtroom crying while others shouted `` Praise the Lord!'' He preached to his Long Island ministry on Easter Sunday, after the judge agreed to delay sentencing to allow him to appear there on the holiday.

 Moslem guerrillas killed 53 Afghan army troops and shot down five aircraft in fighting around <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s strategic eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, the insurgents claimed today. However, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON>, an Afghan government spokesman in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, said 190 insurgents died in the fighting around <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and that two government soldiers and three civilians were killed.

The guerrilla-run <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said 53 communist troops died, 98 were wounded and five deserted in heavy fighting since Saturday. Insurgents shot down four helicopters and one airplane and captured several posts north of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, the agency claimed. It gave no estimate of guerrilla casualties. The guerrillas said heavy fighting continued around the city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, the airport to the southeast and in suburbs to the north. It said the Afghan air force has retaliated with heavy bombing, causing many high civilian casualties. <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> is the target of the guerrillas' first major offensive since Feb. 15, the date Soviet troops ended nine years of involvement in the Afghan war. Afghan government forces hold the country's key cities but guerrillas reportedly control about 90 percent of the countryside.

<TEXT>
 Pathologists today examined a human skeleton found near the place Lord <PERSON> Lucan </PERSON> last was seen alive following the murder of his children's nanny more than 14 years ago. But <LOCATION> Sussex </LOCATION> police said they thought it unlikely the remains were those of the missing earl. `` I would treat that with a great deal of skepticism,'' a police officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Police said until tests are completed on the skeleton, they will not know the age and sex of the person, the cause of death or how long ago it occurred. The skeleton was discovered Saturday in thick undergrowth on the Beachy Head coastal promontory. <PERSON> Lucan </PERSON> was last seen alive at <LOCATION> Uckfield </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s south coast, Nov. 7, 1974, the day <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivett </PERSON> was battered to death and <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucan </PERSON> was attacked at the <PERSON> Lucan </PERSON> family's <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> home. A car he borrowed was found abandoned at <LOCATION> Newhaven </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Beachy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION>, 18 miles south of <LOCATION> Uckfield </LOCATION>.

 A longtime diabetic whose pancreas had virtually destroyed his heart has been given another chance to live after doctors transplanted both organs in what is believed to be the first such operation ever. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, 45, was listed in serious condition today at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, and a spokeswoman said he was given an 80 percent chance of surviving a year. But before the surgery Saturday, the Silver Spring, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, physicist's chances of living even a week were slim. `` He was slipping away,'' his wife <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said. `` When you see a loved on slipping away, you grab at anything that can help him ... I knew this was it. This was his last chance.'' <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>'s body has shown no signs of rejecting the organs, doctors said. And if all continues to go well, he could leave the hospital within weeks and eventually return to work as a senior scientist for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s Strategic Defense Initiative program, they said. <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> had undergone heart bypass surgery seven years ago, but the organ had begun deteriorating again over the past several months. He was hospitalized a week before a local donor was found. `` This is very fast,'' said <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brigham </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consortium </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was very, very fortunate in terms of timing.'' Doctors refused to identify the donor. <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>'s doctors decided to transplant his pancreas as well as his heart because they believed his severe diabetes would make management of a new heart difficult or impossible. Although the hospital does not have permission from the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to transplant the pancreas, surgeons went ahead with the double transplant anyway, fearing <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> would die if they waited. `` To our knowledge it's the first -LRB- heart-pancreas transplant -RRB- ever done,'' said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodge </PERSON>. Dr. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sollinger </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> surgeon considered one of the leading experts in pancreas transplants, was flown in by private jet Saturday morning. The procedure, which was divided into separate operations for each transplant, lasted the entire day. `` Everything proceeded wonderfully,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Light, a member of the surgical team. `` The pancreas is working, and we think his diabetes is cured.'' The pancreas is supposed to produce insulin, the hormone that regulates the body's metabolism of sugar. When the organ does n't function properly, patients develop diabetes, and often have to rely on insulin injections and constant monitering to survive `` Diabetes can destroy the vascular system,'' said Ms. Dodge. `` Severe heart disease is a complication of diabetes.'' The one-year survival rate for patients receiving a new pancreas has been about 50 percent, compared with 85 percent for other organs, Light said. But improvements in management of anti-rejection drugs for the pancreas should improve <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>'s outlook, making his chances of surviving one year about 80 percent, doctors said.

 Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions taken Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. HOSPITAL CHAPLAIN The court let stand a ruling that a public hospital does not violate the constitutionally required separation of church and state by having a chaplain on its payroll. The court, without comment, refused to hear an appeal by three <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> atheists who said taxpayers should not be forced to fund a chaplain's salary at a county-run hospital. The case is <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Broadlawns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, 88-128 DEATH PENALTY The court said it will restudy how far states may go in limiting a jury's discretion to choose life or death for convicted murderers. The court agreed to decide whether <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s death penalty law violates the Constitution by improperly limiting jury discretion. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s death penalty statute says: `` The verdict must be a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance ... and no mitigating circumstance.'' The case is <PERSON> Blystone </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, 88-6222. JUDGE ` S LAWSUIT The court refused to review a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> judge's lawsuit against two newspapers that reported on what was to have been a confidential state investigation of him. The court, without comment, let stand rulings that dismissed state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON>'s suit against The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Gazette </ORGANIZATION>.

 Guatemalan militiamen brandished machine guns and ordered <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Iltis </PERSON> out of his jeep. Iltis, determined to protect his precious hoard, brandished right back. `` I showed anger _ arrogance, if you like,'' the 63-year-old scientist recalled. `` I flashed out my documents. They backed off. They let me go on.'' This Indiana Jones-style encounter involved neither gold nor gems but, rather, a humble looking, weedy plant. Iltis, an intense, burly, Czech-born botanist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>, is one of the world's foremost collectors of rare plant species. The precious cargo he was protecting from the Guatemalans several years ago was a genetic cousin of corn called teosinte. Because its genes may carry resistance to certain viruses, this scraggly plant may someday prove more valuable to mankind than gold. As such plant-rich parts of the globe as the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle are stripped and despoiled, scientists and governments are racing time to gather rare plant species and preserve them before they are lost forever. Iltis has braved harsh climates and tropical sickness and says he has occasionally given `` gifts'' at customs posts to ensure the safe passage of himself and his botanical booty across borders. And he said plant hunters sometimes face tough practical and ethical choices. Increasingly, Third World nations see the germplasm issue as just another instance of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stealing their resources. The last thing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> botanists want to be accused of is plundering such nations. Iltis said that in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and other countries that have placed `` impossibly difficult'' and time-consuming restrictions on plant exploration, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists look for quiet ways around the regulations. `` You're supposed to collect with the permission of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' said Iltis. `` I never have, but I always share.'' Iltis says he makes up for his intrusions by religiously sending back duplicates of any samples to Mexican scientists. He has also sent valuable plant reference books to colleagues in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and other Central American nations he has explored. Interviews with several plant hunters revealed that conservation, rather than profit, is most often their prime motivator. Some, like Iltis, join the hunt for purely scientific reasons that have nothing to do with improving agriculture. `` There is nothing in the world so thrilling to a taxonomist than to walk into an entirely new flora,'' he told a recent visitor to his university herbarium where row after row of special movable file cabinets house hundreds of rare species of corn and other trophies of more than two decades of expeditions to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` For anyone studying natural history, life can never be long enough,'' he said. Slowly, governments, including our own, have begun sponsoring and financing plant expeditions because rare species may contain genetic information that plant breeders and geneticists can someday use to help protect crops from viruses, drought or other life-threatening blights or hazards. Yet despite the limitless potential of this genetic resource called `` germplasm'' and the high importance scientists attach to its preservation, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> has financed an average of only four expeditions a year since 1956, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> figures. In the fiscal year 1989, a relatively flush year for germplasm exploration, the government is still spending only $ 150,000 to finance about a dozen missions. Nevertheless, that is more than the mere $ 40,000 spent by the government as recently as 1986, according to <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sperling </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s plant exploration office, who has been on three expeditions to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and plans to go to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> this spring to gather wild lentils, chick peas and pistachios. Government-sponsored trips tend to be less hazardous than those undertaken by private scientists, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Spooner </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> botanist who spends 2-3 months a year on plant expeditions for the government, mostly hunting potato species. Such trips usually involve sharing the fruits of the search with scientists from the host country. But prior to his stint as a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> explorer, <PERSON> Spooner </PERSON> recalls, he knew all too well the dangers of attempting the same thing on nothing more than a passport and plane ticket. `` I traveled throughout <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and I was hassled constantly,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, police stopped him and asked for money, he said. In <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, police stopped him `` every 50 kilometers'' and challenged him to produce credentials. `` What do you do if authorities ask for bribes?'' mused <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> plant research associate who has explored for plants in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries. `` You pay it.''

<HEAD>Lorain Ties Future To Casino Proposal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 This city on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> is moving closer to becoming the third area in the country with legalized casino gambling, but residents still disagree whether a casino would be a blessing or a curse. <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, an economically struggling and largely blue-collar city of 72,000 people, would have a referendum on the issue under the proposal the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved March 15. `` It would make more work and brighten this little town up,'' said <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON>, 50, a 27-year employee at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lorain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> But <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, 32, a mother of two, said she may already start to fight against the proposal. `` I think it would hurt <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, and it would hurt <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> families,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>. `` I think crime would definitely go up.'' The proposal, which has been pending for 14 months, faces an uncertain future in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where hearings start next month. Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> wo n't say yet whether he would sign or veto the legislation. House approval sparked a surge of opposition, including comments from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>'s top two elected officials that a casino might attract organized crime. A organization of Roman Catholic bishops in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> opposes any change in state law that could lead to development of a casino. The House bill would permit voter-approved casino gambling only in <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, as a five-year pilot project. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law allows charity bingo, horse racing and the state-run lottery, but casino gambling is legal only in the state of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The bishops said bingo games had enough potential for abuse that parishes were being encouraged to find other ways to raise money, and that non-charitable gambling was even more dangerous. The originator of the proposal is <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON>, whose family operates more than 20 car dealerships in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON> envisions building a $ 400 million resort that will include a 1,000-room hotel, restaurants, shops and a casino on a former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> property his family owns on the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which meets <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, 29 miles west of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. The bill's sponsor, state Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Koziura </PERSON>, believes voters would approve the casino proposal. <PERSON> Koziura </PERSON>, a Democrat from <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, bristles when he talks about opposition by <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON>, a Republican, and <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, a Democrat. `` It could cause us some problems,'' <PERSON> Koziura </PERSON> said. `` This is not a Republican or a Democratic bill. This bill is simply an economic development tool that we feel we ought to have the right to vote on.'' Many believe the project would be an economic boom to <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, which has struggled in the 1980s because of the loss of about 5,000 jobs at the <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> plant, the elimination of approximately 2,000 jobs at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and the 1983 shutdown of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION>, which at its peak employed 1,500. <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> had an unemployment rate of 10.4 percent in February, while <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> had a statewide rate of 6.9 percent, said Mayor <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Olejko </PERSON>, one of the proposal's strongest backers. Supporters believe the casino-hotel complex would employ up to 4,000 people, with increases in tourist-related employment providing a net gain of 10,000 jobs. Others are concerned that a casino would increase crime and corruption. Police Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Malinovsky </PERSON> was indicted this month on felony charges of extortion and perjury for allegedly pressuring fire inspectors into ignoring fire code violations at a charity bingo hall his daughter planned to run. One of his subordinates, Sgt. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, is serving a two-year prison term in connection with the same investigation. Safety Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Yepko </PERSON> resigned last week after police announced that he was being investigated for allegedly telling local clubs shortly after <PERSON> Malinovsky </PERSON>'s arrest that illegal gambling would be overlooked. <PERSON> Yepko </PERSON> has n't been charged. `` I think all this negative publicity will hurt the chances of the casino,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Azzariti </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a high school business teacher who says he has n't decided how he would vote. `` <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> needs something, and we need to develop the waterfront,'' <PERSON> Azzariti </PERSON> said. `` But you'd have to worry about the crime element. You'd have to worry about the kinds of people a casino draws in. I worry about these things, too _ about what's going to happen to the moral fiber of the community. <PERSON> Olejko </PERSON> said the legislation includes protections against organized crime. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> attorney general automatically would be a member of a commission overseeing the casino's operation, and voters would have an opportunity to decide whether to retain the casino after five years.

 All students, teachers and administrators at a private high school will be checked for illegal drug use in a testing program believed to be one of the most far-reaching in the country, officials say. `` We're not trying to be any trend-setters. We're just trying to do whatever we can to look out for our kids,'' said <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, headmaster of the 276-student <ORGANIZATION> Indianola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, which has boys and girls in grades seven through 12. The program, to begin in August, will include the 24 members of the school's board of directors. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said school officials have not decided yet which drugs will be targeted. The town of 13,000 residents, 130 miles south of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, `` sort of'' has a drug problem, says Police Chief Roosevelt <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. Police say two recent burglary-related shootings may have been related to drugs. Officials with private school associations say <LOCATION> Indianola </LOCATION>'s mandatory program is one of the most extensive in the country `` I've never heard of anything like -LRB- it -RRB-. That's very unusual,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. Drug testing programs generally target student-athletes or students suspected of using illegal drugs. Youngsters who refuse to participate in the urine-sample testing will have to leave the academy. Those who test positive will be referred to treatment programs and could be excluded from extracurricular activities, authorities say. The program, expected to cost $ 9,000 a year, was approved earlier this month by the school's board.

 The state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today formally sent to the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> articles of impeachment against Treasurer <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> stemming from losses of $ 279 million in a fund under <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>'s control in 1987. The committee voted 17-7 to recommend the impeachment after adding two additional articles to the 16 it voted for last Wednesday. The popular, flamboyant <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, 61, is in his second term as state treasurer. He is a Democrat, and his party also controls the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> and state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. House Speaker <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said the body could vote on impeachment as early as Wednesday. If it passes the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the case would then go to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for a trial. Senate President <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, anticipating that a majority of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will vote to impeach <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, has told his colleagues to be prepared to hear the case in May and estimated the trial would take three to four weeks. The last time a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> treasurer was impeached and removed from office was in 1876. Also today, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> then voted 22-3 to censure state Auditor <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gainer </PERSON> for his role in the losses. The articles recommend that <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> be impeached for maladministration, incompetence, neglect of duty and high crimes and misdemeanors for his role in the investment fund losses and for conspiring to cover them up. The two articles added today accuse him of putting an unqualified person in control of the state's investment portfolio after two previous treasury employees left and having the treasurer's office charge a service fee for handling investments in the fund. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, Gainer, and former Gov. <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> made up the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> when the losses occurred in the consolidated investment fund. The board had general supervisory control over the fund. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>'s office had direct investment powers. Committee members were angered by statements <PERSON> Gainer </PERSON> made to them during 10 days of testimony on the impeachment issue. They believed he should have been more active in the fund's supervision. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> left office in January after being unseated by <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> in last year's general election.

Marchers have been demonstrating against low-level <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> training flights over <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the alliance's plans to modernize short-range nuclear weapons based in this country, and they have demanded increased disarmament initiatives from the West. `` Modernize defense policies, and not atomic rockets,'' said a banner at a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> rally. Peace activists want the short-range rockets dismantled and not modernized, saying they are not needed because of a lessened military threat from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Heidemarie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wieczorek-Zeul </PERSON>, an official with the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the modernization plans could violate the 1987 Soviet-U.S. treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles based in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` We have certainly not struggled for the destruction of <LOCATION> Pershing </LOCATION> and cruise missiles so that we can now stand by and watch them be replaced by new atomic rockets,'' she said at the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> rally. In <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, an official with the giant workers' union <ORGANIZATION> IG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metall </ORGANIZATION> criticized the government's defense policies as well as the modernization plans. <PERSON> Karin </PERSON> <PERSON> Benz-Overhage </PERSON> called on the government to nullify its decision to raise compulsory military service terms from 15 months to 18 months. Ms. <PERSON> Benz-Overhage </PERSON> also charged the government has shown little willingness to undertake disarmament initiatives. `` More and more young people do n't want to have anything to do with this kind of nonsense anymore,'' she told the <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> rally.

<HEAD>Cherokees Observe 150th Anniversary of End of Tragic Removal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 It is no celebration the <LOCATION> Cherokees </LOCATION> plan this week, although spring brings a special joy in the adopted homeland where the tribe ended its greatest tragedy 150 years ago. In the winter of 1838-39, thousands of Cherokees died on a forced march from their homes in the southeastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to what is now northeastern <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. The path is known as the Trail of Tears. On Friday and Saturday, the tribe observes the sesquicentennial of that time. The last of 14 groups of Cherokees escorted by federal troops arrived in late March 1839. <PERSON> Wilma </PERSON> <PERSON> Mankiller </PERSON>, chief of the nation's second-largest <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> tribe, said <PERSON> Cherokees </PERSON> decided to mark the sesquicentennial after some hesitation because of the sensitivity that lingers over those days. The tribe settled on a commemoration only after wagon hobbyists not affiliated with the tribe re-traced the Trail of Tears last fall. Ms. <PERSON> Mankiller </PERSON> noted most Cherokees made the trek by foot, some in shackles. `` It was n't a friendly removal,'' she said. `` I think there are a number of people who have concerns,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Mankiller </PERSON>, chief since 1985. `` I think it's healthy for us to look back -LRB- and show -RRB- respect for our ancestors. `` It helps to place our present problems in a historical context. But I certainly understand the concerns of people about looking at this issue. `` I think for us it's a very solemn, very emotional time. We look at it as something that happened to our family.'' Ms. <PERSON> Mankiller </PERSON> said the observance provides `` a chance to do some public education about our history.'' `` There's so little accurate information about what modern American Indians are like. There's a vacuum,'' she said. Most Americans know only the Indians they see depicted in <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> movies, Ms. <PERSON> Mankiller </PERSON> said. In the tribe's capital of <LOCATION> Tahlequah </LOCATION>, a university city of 10,000, there will be speeches, story-telling and flute playing. A tree will be planted in honor of the estimated 4,000 Cherokees who died along the trail. Donated hogs will be cooked in huge black kettles on the grounds of a historic home. There will be free corn bread and beans, eggs and wild onions. `` This is what the Indians of the hills eat ... whatever food they could find and forage,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ketcher </PERSON>, deputy chief of the tribe, who remembers when his own relatives would not discuss the tragedy. Those forced westward included Cherokees who owned plantations and had assimilated into the dominant white culture. But the tribe had its own government and its own written language when President <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ordered the Cherokees removed from land sought by white settlers. <PERSON> Ketcher </PERSON>'s great-grandparents were on the trail, uprooted from northern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` I never did hear about the trail when I was growing up _ nothing, not anything,'' <PERSON> Ketcher </PERSON> said. `` Was it just an attempt to shut it out _ like it never happened? `` Many of them would just prefer to forget the whole thing, because it was such a tragic event in the lives of our people.'' Ms. <PERSON> Mankiller </PERSON>, who keeps busy with speaking engagements nationwide, said the sesquicentennial should remind tribal members of their resiliency. `` It is intended to be sort of a solemn occasion ... But also at the same time look back about what happened after the Trail of Tears. We were able to bounce back in the 1800s,'' she said. A commemorative plaque depicts a legendary <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> bird arising from ashes to assume the form of a Cherokee warrior. The tribe arrived in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> politically divided over removal. But the tribe rebounded to re-form a government, enforce tribal laws and erect government buildings that still stand. It established some of the first schools west of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, including a school for women. `` Lots of people in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> believe that <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> history began with the Land Run -LRB- of 1889 -RRB-. We had been here for a couple of generations. We had made this area hospitable. We had settled it,'' she said. Today the Cherokee Nation's concerns focus on education, health care and employment, Ms. <PERSON> Mankiller </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Cherokee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> has a booming greenhouse operation in <LOCATION> Tahlequah </LOCATION>, a defense contracting plant in <LOCATION> Stilwell </LOCATION> and industrial tracts, but economic development in the rural areas remains a major concern. `` I share that frustration, I think, with every other small town in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Mankiller </PERSON> said.

 Sales of existing homes fell in February for the second straight month as higher interest rates pushed buyers out of the market, a real estate trade group said Monday. Sales of existing single-family homes dropped 3.1 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.44 million units, the slowest pace since the 3.38 million rate recorded last March, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> reported. February's decline followed an even sharper 9.4 percent sales drop in January. The Realtors attributed the recent weakness in sales to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s yearlong campaign to drive up interest rates in an effort to slow the economy and ease inflationary pressures. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s credit stance is working,'' said Realtors President <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON>. `` Interest rates are pushed up and buyers are pushed out.'' Fixed-rate home mortgages last month averaged between 10.55 percent and 10.78 percent, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of between 8.56 percent and 8.73 percent By last week, the rates were up to 11.22 percent and 9.30 pecent, respectively. Because lower-income buyers generally were the ones pushed out of the market by the higher rates, the median price of existing homes sold last month increased, the Realtors reported. The median rose $ 3,400 to $ 93,100, meaning half sold for more and half for less. `` Generally, in times of rising rates, the people left in the market tend to be upper-income buyers who can buy the house they want regardless of less affordable financing,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist for the group. He said the resale pace is not expected to drop much further because economic growth appears to be slowing to a level acceptable to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>. February's decline in home sales was led by a sharp drop in the high-priced Northeast, where the market began to cool last year after an earlier surge in prices. Resales in the region were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 580,000 last month, down 18.3 percent from the previous month. The median price of a home in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> was $ 142,600, down $ 1,200 from the previous month. The higher interest rates `` probably will prolong stagnation in some of those markets,'' <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> said. Sales in the South were down 0.8 percent to an annual rate of 1.3 million units last month, with the median price in that region rising $ 6,100 last month to $ 88,500. Sales dropped 1.1 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to an annual rate of 920,000 units, while the median price rose $ 2,100 to $ 69,900. The West was the only region to record an increase in sales last month, with the annual rate rising 3.2 percent to 650,000 units. The median price in the region was $ 133,700, up $ 3,000 from January. `` Strong economic growth in the West has made it better prepared to withstand credit tightening,'' <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> said. `` This region contains some of the hottest markets in the country now, and buyers there seem to be less affected by hikes in interest rates.''

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> human rights group that monitored the Soviet parliamentary elections said Monday the system appeared to be efficient but there were flaws that could have led to rigging the results. Soviet newspapers reported some voters were disenfranchised because of election difficulties. <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON>, the chairman of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> election commission, acknowledged some snags developed in Sunday's voting, the first multicandidate elections in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 70 years. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carliner </PERSON>, an attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference that six delegates visited 17 polling stations in eight election districts. `` The process appeared efficient and officials took their duty quite seriously,'' he said. `` It was clear that they did not try in any way to influence the voters.'' Voters interviewed by the delegation `` were satisfied that their ballots were secret and sacred and would be counted,'' <PERSON> Carliner </PERSON> said. There were possibilities to commit election fraud, however, mainly because there were n't enough Soviet observers to monitor all polling stations, he said. At several polling stations, there were no observers or officials present by late afternoon. `` The lack of observers left open a chance to cheat,'' <PERSON> Carliner </PERSON> said. `` Anyone could have walked in, marked up a bunch of ballots and stuffed them into the box.'' In addition, special voting passes had been given to many people such as businessmen and tourists, allowing them to vote away from their residences, he said. That left the system open to abuse, he said. `` We ran up against masses of absolutely new moments, currents and problems,'' <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON> said from the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> City Council headquarters. `` Some things we did satisfactorily, some things did not get done until the end.'' Soviet newspapers carried complaints of people who said they were denied a chance to vote. `` In some election districts, a few disabled people were denied the voting right because of the inefficiency of voting commissions,'' <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said. In past elections, the disabled could request a ballot box be brought to their residences. If a person could not get to a polling station, a relative could take the person's internal passport and cast the vote by proxy. The newspaper said the election commission of the <LOCATION> Cheremushkinsky </LOCATION> district responded to the complaint by saying, `` They only had two portable ballot boxes and they were short of time.'' In other districts, residents did not receive the special mailed invitation cards needed to cast a ballot, it said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> group has monitored elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Seven people who were seriously injured in the devastating December earthquake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> headed home Monday after weeks of medical care and rehabilitation in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospitals. `` They looked radiant,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Americares </ORGANIZATION>, the medical relief organization that coordinated the effort. The patients were accompanied by 12,000 pounds of medical equipment and 16 physicians and other medical volunteers who will set up a clinic in the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to treat hundreds who lost limbs in the earthquake. Patients will be fitted with prosthetics which will be made at the clinic, and will undergo physical therapy. `` The whole purpose of this effort is to start working on them over there and to train some of the Armenians to carry on the work,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Among those returning home was 8-year-old <PERSON> Arman </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazarian </PERSON>, who could not walk because of a spinal injury when he arrived last month at the Hospital for Joint Diseases and <ORGANIZATION> Orthopaedic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 The judge in the Iran-Contra trial Monday rejected <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s bid to have former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appear in court Friday as the defense's first witness, but held out the possibility he might be called later. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he wanted `` a succinct particularized statement of facts'' from <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers on what they want to elicit from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> before he would decide whether the former president must testify. In a two-page order, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said the defense should file that statement under seal by late Wednesday afternoon. The prosecution wo n't be permitted to see it. North lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> asked the court last Friday to enter an order enforcing a subpoena issued in December directing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to appear at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> sought to have <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appear this coming Friday as the defense's leadoff witness. `` There is insufficient time to resolve the pending questions relating to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s personal appearance to contemplate his appearance by Friday, March 31, as requested,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said a hearing date on the questions concerning <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s possible appearance will be scheduled `` based on developments at trial. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> also said he wants other issues regarding <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s subpoena for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` to be resolved expeditiously this week. The trial was in recess Monday and was to resume Tuesday. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he wanted to know whether the ex-president personally objects to appearing at `` a later date convenient for him'' or whether other arrangements for his testimony could be substituted. These could include a videotaped deposition or excerpts from personal diaries, said the judge. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, acting on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s behalf, opposes <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s subpoena. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> is trying to show that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his advisers approved <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s actions. The fired <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide is charged with 12 crimes, including obstructing and making false statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by denying he was involved in secretly assisting the Contras. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said `` the importance'' of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s testimony to the defense of this case `` is clear both from the record in the trial to date'' and from earlier arguments made by the defense. North's lawyers have brought out at the trial that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> personally approved a secret deal to slip $ 110 million in extra aid to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to entice the country's government to back the Contras. The defense also introduced documents designed to show that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> approved airdropping intelligence materials and recoilless rifles to the Contras to destroy arms-bearing ships headed for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s actions took place during a congressional ban on military aid to the Contras.

 Police and soldiers surrounded a prison farm today where about 250 inmates held guards and Easter visitors hostage, officials said. Seven people were reported killed and about 20 wounded in the takeover. Officials said inmates took over the prison farm on Sunday after wresting rifles from prison guards. At least 300 police officers and 400 soldiers armed with rifles and submachines guns surrounded the prison, reports said. Three of those who died Sunday in the uprising at the <LOCATION> Pavon </LOCATION> prison farm _ the country's largest penal institution _ were inmates and three were guards, according to a judge who spoke on the condition of anonymity. A fourth guard died today of his injuries, said prison spokesman <PERSON> Conrado </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroy </PERSON>. The judge said he did not know how many people were hurt, but a witness interviewed on a local radio station said about 20 people were wounded in a gun battle between guards and inmates. It was not clear how many hostages the inmates held _ one report said about 400 _ or how much of the 2.5 square mile facility they controlled. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON>, director general of prisons, told reporters today that he was reviewing demands of about 250 armed inmates. The inmates reportedly raided the prison armory, then took over the prison farm about 12 miles from <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, at around noon Sunday. Prisoners surrendered many of the weapons during negotiations with authorities, news reports said. Negotiators said the talks ended just before midnight and were to resume today. Negotiators told reporters about 1,000 people remained inside the institution including guards, inmates who had not joined in the rioting, and families with children who were visiting on Easter Sunday. Television station <PERSON> Notisiete </PERSON> said about 400 people were being held hostage. But one negotiator, reporter <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gatica </PERSON> <PERSON> Trejo </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grafico </ORGANIZATION>, said the number of hostages was not clear. The prison farm has room for 1,350 prisoners, but it was not known how many were inside when the uprising began. <PERSON> Trejo </PERSON> said inmate demands included amnesties or reduced sentences, a change in prison officials, and better food and treatment. Another negotiator, Fire Department Cmdr. <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Giammattei </PERSON> <PERSON> Falla </PERSON>, said the inmates also demanded to talk with federal human rights director <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Riva </PERSON>, who was out of town and not scheduled to return until today. Television newscasts showed the prison farm surrounded by police and soldiers sent from the capital. An air force helicopter hovered overhead. <PERSON> Notisiete </PERSON> said additional army units were on standby. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a private radio station, broadcast an interview with a man identified as <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>. He said he and his wife, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, were waiting outside to visit a relative when the revolt broke out. <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> told the radio station his wife was among about 20 people wounded in a gunfight between inmates and guards. He said he initially took his wounded wife into a prison chapel, where many other visitors sought refuge and treatment for the injured. He said his wife was taken to a police hospital and he did not know the extent of her injuries. In an uprising at the same prison farm five years ago, guards shot 12 inmates to death after a prisoner tried to attack a guard with a knife during roll call.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s leader, Gen. <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, urged the military Monday to continue its struggle against the country's dozen rebel groups On Sunday, government troops overran the main <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> camp of <PERSON> Maw </PERSON> <PERSON> Po </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, in <ORGANIZATION> Karen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, located on the border with <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. The victory came after three days of intense fighting, according to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s state radio. The broadcast said 38 government troops were killed and 189 soldiers wounded; at least 74 rebels were killed. `` The traitors such as the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rebels ... and the <ORGANIZATION> Karen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> ... who are lackeys of foreign powers, continue their efforts ... to cause the disintegration of the state,'' <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> said at a military parade marking Armed Forces Day. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> seized power in a bloody coup in September when his troops killed hundreds of people to crush a nationwide movement for democracy. On Monday, he repeated pledges the military will hand over power to the winner of a general election next year. `` With the improvement of the general situation, free and fair general elections will be held throughout the country, except in the areas where there is no peace and tranquility because of rebel activities,'' he said. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> has been torn by ethnic clashes since gaining independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> four decades ago. The Karens, with about 4,000 fighters, roam vast tracts of the southeastern border with <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. Sunday's loss of Maw Po <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, 80 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Raheng </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, was considered a major defeat, sources said. The Karens had held the camp for several years despite previous government offensives. Government troops seized rebel weapons and ammunition in the attack, the broadcast said. The fighting forced the evacuation of 3,000 people from the <LOCATION> Tha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Song </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yang </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, located near the camp. Government troops captured two other <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> camps along the Thai-Burmese border in December and January. The Karens are one of a dozen minority groups that have sought greater autonomy promised to them in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s constitution after independence was won from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1948. The minorities live in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s rugged frontier and make up about 30 percent of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s 38 million people. Most Burmese live in the central part of the country. The lifestyles and traditions of the minorities differ from those of the dominant <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION>, who are mainly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION>.

 As <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> gets ready for its yearly orgy of self-congratulation, where is a jaded journalist to go for the other side of the story _ the detached, indifferent, listless and world-weary side? <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruba </PERSON>, a public relations consultant, is meeting that need. As creator of The Boring Institute, he says his phone has been ringing constantly with interview requests prompted by his satirical `` most boring'' lists. <PERSON> Caruba </PERSON>'s latest, released March 20, was the `` Most Boring Film Awards,'' a sendup of the Academy Awards. <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> is a big winner for his two 1988 releases, `` Raw,'' and `` Coming To <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' which <PERSON> Caruba </PERSON> says, `` run the gamut from merely vulgar to monotonously obscene.'' The institute will surface again in July with `` National Anti-Boredom Month,'' followed in September by `` Fearless Forecasts of TV's Fall Flops.'' The `` Most Boring Celebrities of the Year'' in December resulted in 200 radio interviews for <PERSON> Caruba </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caruba </PERSON>, a 51-year-old bachelor who still lives with his parents in the house where he was raised, says the popularity of his lampoon confirms his beliefs about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s media-glutted society. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public is being exploited cynically by film producers and people who choose what television programs they see. `` We are asked to live our lives vicariously through others, primarily on television,'' he said.

<HEAD>White House Says Gray Has Withdrawn Complaint About Aid Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: New material, editing throughout with White House brushing
aside Gray complaint and rebuking him. ^By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The White House, trying to put an end to an embarrassing episode, today brushed aside a complaint from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s legal counsel about the new Contra aid agreement and issued what amounted to a public rebuke of the official. In a highly unusual move, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> was quoted Sunday as saying the agreement encroached on the president's power to conduct foreign policy Privately, White House officials were perplexed that <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> would go public with a challenge to a policy <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had embraced. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sidestepped a question about whether he was angry at Gray. Mingling with thousands of children on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION> during the annual Easter egg roll, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` On a day like this, I'm not angry at anybody.'' White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> met with chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> today. `` They had a polite discussion about how things work in the White House,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Asked why <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> would have felt that the agreement had not received proper legal review, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> replied, `` I just ca n't tell you what was in <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s mind That's more than I can handle.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s comments amounted to a rare public rebuke of another senior White House official. The press secretary was asked whether <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> had been told that he should work through proper channels instead of taking his complaints to the press. `` I do n't know that they did tell him that,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` I think that's a good idea. I'd tell him that.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added, `` All the appropriate discussions have been commenced and completed with Mr. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and he fully understands our position.'' The spokesman said, `` <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> simply explained his concerns and they were met and that's pretty much the end of it.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> played down the dispute and insisted that the accord does not surrender presidential power to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a voluntary agreement,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Sunday. `` ` You do not have the question arise here with respect to constitutional powers and prerogatives because the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is not imposing its will, in effect, through legislation.'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> himself tried to play down the dispute today during the daily meeting of senior White House officials. He told his colleagues that reports of his concerns were overstated and that he did n't think there were any problems with the agreement, according to an official who declined to be identified. `` He basically backed off,'' the official said. `` There's a lot of discussion of this and a feeling that it was really a somewhat bizarre occurrence and should n't have happened.'' The episode marked <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s second run-in with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, one of the most powerful figures in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. Earlier, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> had raised questions about the propriety of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s financial holdings, and the secretary later disposed of the assets. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> did not return telephone calls seeking comment. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> had expressed concern in a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> interview about a provision giving any of four congressional committees the power to cut off aid to the Nicaraguan rebels after November if lawmakers conclude that the Contras' continued presence is harming Central American peace efforts. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said the provision was `` much more than a gentleman's agreement'' because `` it's in writing and becomes a precedent, although not as serious as if it were in legislation. Both <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and White House national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said on television news shows Sunday that they did not agree with <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> on the subject. But neither would criticize him directly, with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> sidestepping questions about the dispute. A television interviewer noted that it was <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> who `` a few weeks ago embarrassed you publicly by calling attention'' to stock held by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in a bank with major outstanding loans to foreign countries. `` Now he is complaining that you have made a deal that is wrong. Is there room for both of you in this administration?'' `` Nice try, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>,'' replied <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. `` The fact of the matter is, the president, the chief of staff, the national security adviser to the president and I all discussed this particular provision. So, good try.'' `` So, you do n't care to predict how long <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> will be in the administration?'' persisted a second questioner. `` Good try, <PERSON> David </PERSON>,'' replied <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, appearing at the White House with congressional leaders from both parties to announce the deal last Friday, hailed it as a return to a bipartisan foreign policy. The previous administration repeatedly failed to reach accord with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted to end military aid to the Contras in 1988, and the current appropriation of $ 27.1 million in humanitarian aid ends next Friday. Contra forces are now encamped across the border in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Under the new agreement, negotiated by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and congressional leaders, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would vote after its Easter recess to send the Contras $ 4.5 million a month in non-military aid through February 1990. The administration, meanwhile, would pledge in writing to pursue diplomatic means to end fighting in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government has committed itself to hold free elections in February 1990, according to an earlier accord among Central American presidents. Nicaraguan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendano </PERSON>, interviewed by satellite on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' said that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy still was `` out of step with what the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents have agreed upon'' because it would not disband the Contras. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, also appearing on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, said that the accord among Central American presidents called for an agreement by May 15 on demobilizing the Contras, but not their immediate dissolution. If the Sandinistas do not hold elections as promised, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might use `` sticks'' that would `` involve tightening economic sanctions, further diplomatic sanctions and ... there is nothing in this agreement that would foreclose the president's future request for military assistance, should things deteriorate substantially.''

 A crewman without proper certification was in command when an Exxon tanker apparently hit two rocks and ran aground, causing the nation's biggest oil spill, the company said. Officials said a third mate was in command, against company policy, at the time of Friday morning's accident that sent an estimated 10.1 million gallons of crude oil into <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Williams </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> south of here and prompted the governor Sunday to declare the sound a disaster area. The Exxon Valdez crewman did not have the proper license to legally operate such a large ship in the sound, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunphy </PERSON> said Sunday that the captain, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, was in the cabin at the time of the grounding. But today he said `` the captain's whereabouts are uncertain throughout the entire incident. It is known he was not on the bridge for the complete time.'' Both he and another company spokesman, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran-Wescott </PERSON>, said that even if <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was present during part of the time on the bridge, he was not in command. `` We do know the captain was not in command,'' Ms. <PERSON> Curran-Wescott </PERSON> said. `` He apparently may have been physically present on the bridge.'' <PERSON> Dunphy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was consulting an attorney. Meanwhile, winds topping 25 knots this morning forced postponement of efforts to clean up the sound with chemicals to disperse the oil or fire to burn it off. `` Some of the cleanup operations, such as the use of skimmers and also dispersants and the burn technique, have been put on hold,'' <PERSON> Dunphy </PERSON> said. He said he was unsure if the weather would improve enough to allow cleanup to begin later in the day. He said crews using three pumps had managed to move 78,000 barrels of oil from the Exxon Valdez to another tanker, the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, as of 6 a.m., and workers planned to bring in four more pumps todayto speed up the rate of unloading. Based on the findings of divers, the company believes the tanker had struck one rock a glancing blow and was already leaking when it struck a second time and ran around, said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> `` We're surmising there had to be two events,'' he said, but he did n't know how many minutes apart they might have taken place. Coast Guard officials said they could not confirm whether the tanker hit bottom more than once or say what crew memers were on the bridge at the time of the accident. Oil traders and analysts predicted crude oil prices would rise temporarily because it forced the closing of the port of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, southern terminus of the <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> pipeline that carries all crude oil from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Slope </LOCATION>, cutting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude supplies by a quarter. In today's early trading, the May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, was up 57 cents from Thursday's close, trading at $ 20.72 per 42-gallon barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> on Sunday declared the wildlife-rich sound a disaster area and said he would seek federal funds to help with the spill, which the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> estimates has affected about 100 square miles. Oil has washed up on two islands, and sightings were reported of dozens of crude-coated birds. Also Sunday, officials said the government authorized use of chemicals and fire to combat the massive slick. Before winds forced postponement of the effort, <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> had said officials planned to use a C-130 aircraft today to spray chemicals to disperse patches of oil in a 5-square-mile area of the sound. The company also planned to burn `` fingers'' of the slick by igniting them with a laser. `` The volume of oil released in the water is, for all intents and purposes, beyond control by mechanical means alone,'' <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> said the latest estimate of damage to the tanker is eight damaged oil cargo tanks and two damaged ballast tanks. At the time of the disaster Friday, third mate <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON> was in command and his actions violated federal regulations, said Ms. <PERSON> Curran-Wescott </PERSON>. `` He did n't have a proper pilot's license for that. He was n't authorized by the company, nor was it legal,'' she said Neither <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> nor Cousins could be located in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> by The Associated Press for comment. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> took over the investigation Sunday, one day after issuing subpoenas for <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, Cousins and helmsman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kagan </PERSON>, the third member of the bridge crew. Results of routine drug and alcohol tests administered to the three were n't immediately available, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> slated hearings for next week in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was relieved of his command, but to give him rest, not as a disciplinary measure, officials said. The 987-foot tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>, carrying 1.2 million barrels of North Slope crude oil, ran onto a reef 25 miles from port early Friday after swinging out of a traffic lane to avoid ice. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> is at the southern end of the 800-mile <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil pipeline. Estimates put the spill at 240,000 barrels of oil, or about 10.1 million gallons, making it the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spill on record. The only larger oil-related accident in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters involved 10.7 million gallons of oil when two ships collided in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in 1979, but that oil burned as well as spilled. `` This oil spill may well be the greatest disaster to hit <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> since the Good Friday earthquake 25 years ago,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. A wildlife specialist toured the sound and observed 75 ducks and two otters coated with oil, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergmann </PERSON>. A station was set up to clean birds, and a mammal-cleaning station also was planned. Fishermen fearing lost income have sought compensation from the shipping company, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials said. `` We're not ready to absorb any loss,'' said <PERSON> Riki </PERSON> <PERSON> Ott </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishermen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION>. `` We expect full compensation.'' More than four miles of floating boom has been placed in an effort to contain the oil, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. Skimming boats worked to remove the oil. The transfer to a second ship of oil remaining aboard the <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> resumed during the weekend, and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said it could take seven days to unload the damaged vessel. <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> said 36,000 gallons of chemicals that were to be used to break up the oil were in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> and 19,000 were to be flown from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Fishermen and other users of the resource-rich sound have expressed concerns about additional damage that could be done by chemicals. Environmentalists, the governor and other state officials have accused <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of responding too slowly to the spill. <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> operates the oil-loading terminal at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. Both companies said they were satisfied with how the problem was being handled. `` We're proceeding cautiously,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cirigliano </PERSON>. `` We want to make sure we do n't make any mistakes in cleaning up the spill.'' Under the terms of the law authoritizing the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> pipeline, the owner-operator of an oil tanker has strict liability for the first $ 14 million in damage from a spill, according to Oil Spill Intelligence Report, a weekly publication in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. If damage exceeds $ 14 million, claims are paid out of a reserve that is funded by a tariff on oil companies' Alaskan production. The reserve has $ 300 million and can pay up to $ 100 million per spill.

 A man accused of threatening to blow up an airliner has a history of mental problems and has been picked up for similar threats in the past, including ones against President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, officials said Monday. `` We do n't feel that the guy's dangerous, but he's causing people a lot of trouble,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasonkin </PERSON>, 23, was arrested at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after he called the airport police information center late Sunday and told the operator he put a bomb on a London-bound jet, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which operates the airport. <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON> quoted the caller as saying: `` I want $ 1 million or many people will die. I planted a bomb on <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight 102 to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. It's already in the air.'' <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON> said the police kept <PERSON> Sasonkin </PERSON> talking for 20 minutes while they traced the call to a pay phone in the Pan Am terminal building. He was still talking when police reached him. <PERSON> Sasonkin </PERSON>, of the borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, was charged with attempted grand larceny for demanding money, falsely reporting an incident for telling police a bomb was on the plane, and aggravated harassment for making the call, authorities said. <PERSON> Sasonkin </PERSON> was arrested June 27, 1988, for allegedly threatening President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. He's also been picked up several other times for making threatening calls and each time was committed to a mental hospital for observation, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said the flight was not affected. <PERSON> Sasonkin </PERSON> retracted his story and denied placing a bomb on the plane, airline spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriendler </PERSON> said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman on Monday praised the Soviet elections, calling them a `` move in the right direction.'' `` It goes without saying that yesterday's elections were neither free nor democratic by Western standards,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>. `` But they do represent an advance over the practices of the past in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' she added.

It's another sign that they're serious about perestroika,'' she said. Perestroika is the process of restructuring the Soviet economy undertaken by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Sunday's balloting was the first time in 70 years that Soviet citizens had a choice of more than one candidate. Asked what the Soviets should have done to comply with Western standards, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said they should have held `` the same type of elections, I guess, that we have.'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, who made her debut as the department's spokeswoman at Monday's daily briefing, declined to go further, saying elaboration on her comments would `` get me in trouble.''

<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> on Monday pledged to stay in office until the end of his term in 1992 despite the stunning defeat suffered by his <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in nationwide local elections. Opposition parties had cast Sunday's election as a referendum on <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s free-market policies, and <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> had vowed to resign if opposition gains were large enough to make it difficult for him to govern. The governing party came third in the provincial assembly elections behind the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Populist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the conservative <ORGANIZATION> True </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of former premier <PERSON> Suleyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Demirel </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won only three mayorships in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s 67 provincial capitals, down from 54 mayorships it captured in local elections five years ago. <PERSON> Demirel </PERSON> called on <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> `` to be true to his word'' and resign. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> promised to shuffle his Cabinet but said he would stay in office. `` The nation gave us a mandate until 1992, we will be serving the nation until then,'' <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, 61, told a news conference. In a statement to foreign correspondents, <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> said the election results `` would not affect, in any way, the political balance and the parliamentary arithmetic. -LRB- The -RRB- Turkish government's international economic policy and relations will continue unchanged. Apparently giving assurances to the international business community, the statement said `` our engagements, including joint venture arrangements, would suffer no modification.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has a 292-seat majority in the 450-seat legislature. Political analysts attributed <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s loss to inflation that rose to 75 percent in 1988, his family's free-spending lifestyle, charges of nepotism and alleged corruption by state officials. `` The people knew the party in power would not change as a result of these elections. They wanted to give us a message: to bring down inflation faster,'' the premier said. He said `` a little warning was intended by the voters but it went a bit too far.'' Voters elected more than 326,000 provincial assembly members, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members, mayors, village leaders and neighborhood representatives. In the provincial assembly elections, the Social Democrats got 28 percent of the vote nationwide and the True Path had 25.5 percent. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s party was in third place with 22 percent, down from 41 percent in local elections five years ago. The rest of the votes were split among four smaller parties. The Social Democrats won 31 mayorships out of 54 already decided, and the True Path won 15. Social Democrats ousted incumbent governing party mayors in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s three largest cities, <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Izmir </LOCATION>, according to the returns announced by the state radio and the <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> news agency.

 <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s most popular attraction these days is its employment office, where the tourist giant will be hiring up to 4,000 workers a year over the next few years. The employment drive begins next week with a goal of 2,300 new workers by the end of the month to begin staffing $ 1.5 billion in expanded attractions. The first, the Disney-MGM Studios theme park, opens May 1. Disney also has a new, highly visible employment office, or `` Casting Center'' to help attract workers in what is considered a tight job market for entry-level, tourism-hotel-restaurant workers in the area. The $ 10 million center resembles a Venetian Castle with Disney touches. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> ears adorn its crenelated top and a rotunda forming the entryway sports 13 golden-colored <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> characters. `` We know the market is tough,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wacker </PERSON>, director of employee relations. `` But we're confident that when jobs pop up, people will come looking to find them.'' Disney has in the past few years raised its starting rates to $ 5 an hour, while many employers pay the current minimum of $ 3.35. Prospective employees get their first taste of <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>'s world in the Casting Center with a 12-minute film about what it takes to be a Disney `` cast member.'' Disney's dress and grooming rules for men include no beards, moustaches, long hair, earrings or visible tattoos. For women, eye shadow and frosted hair is out, and no earrings larger than a quarter.

The lawyer, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Scaring </PERSON>, said he would consider appealing the sentence, which included five years on probation. <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> had agreed to the sentence in January in exchange for his guilty pleas to two of 18 charges against him. `` I thnk that the Rev. <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> pled guilty because he simply did n't want to put his parishioners through the tragedy and trauma of a court trial,'' Scaring said after Monday's sentencing. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, who was n't present, was <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>'s one-time church secretary whose sexual encounter with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> toppled his PTL ministry.

The judge ordered the minister to pay about $ 26,000 in back taxes, interest and fines and to stay away from <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> also dismissed tax evasion charges against <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>, 52, stood quietly and chewed gum during Monday's proceedings After the sentencing, he kissed his wife goodbye and was escorted to the county jail in handcuffs by sheriff's deputies.

At the Easter service, <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> christened three babies, performed a marriage and received a standing ovation from parishioners. On top of the normal Sunday contribution, <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> asked churchgoers for an extra Easter offering.

<HEAD>Army Won't Accept Updated Stinger Missile Until Problem Fixed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Army has refused for nine months to accept delivery of a new version of its potent Stinger anti-aircraft missile because the heat-seeking weapon sometimes can be fooled by flares, officials said Monday. Capt. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bomier </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, said the problem with the so-called Stinger-RMP is considered relatively minor despite the delay in taking deliveries from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the missile's producer. <PERSON> Bomier </PERSON> said testing of a `` fixed'' version of the new missile is under way, and `` We do n't expect it to take much longer.'' `` We expect the problem that we have can be resolved with modifications to the -LRB- computer -RRB- software -LRB- in the guidance system -RRB-,'' he said. `` But the Army is not going to accept that missile until it can do what we expect it to do and what is written into our contract.'' <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged through its <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office Monday there had been a problem with the Stinger-RMP and that it was working with the Army to correct it. But <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilkerson </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>' Valley Systems Division in <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cucamonga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where the missile is made, refused Monday to discuss when the new round of testing might be completed and deliveries started. The Stinger, renowned for its performance in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> where it helped U.S.-backed resistance fighters overcome Soviet air power, is a shoulder-fired missile for use against airplanes or helicopters. The basic Stinger, delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in 1979, is a heat-seeking missile and can be fooled by some types of flares. The Stinger-RMP is designed to overcome that problem with a more sophisticated guidance system. The `` RMP'' in the name stands for reprogrammable micro-processor. The new missile features removable computer software that can be updated to compensate for new types of flares or threats as they develop. The problem that <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> is working to correct surfaced during final testing of the new missile and involves the missile's failure to ignore certain types of flares when they are ejected from a hovering helicopter Army and corporate officials decline to elaborate further _ citing security classifications _ but stress the problem crops up only in one situation and that even with the one flaw, the Stinger-RMP is a much more effective weapon that the basic Stinger. `` The weapon works,'' <PERSON> Bomier </PERSON> said. `` The problem involves only one target under certain selected conditions. We have n't stopped buying the missile. We just have n't accepted it yet.'' The Army has awarded two contracts to General Dynamics for the Stinger-RMP. They total about $ 900 million and call for delivery of about 23,000 of the missiles through May 1991. In the meantime, the older models of the missile still are being used. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> continues to produce the new missile while the fix is developed for the computer software and it is warehousing them in the interim. <PERSON> Bomier </PERSON> said the company is paying the cost of storage.

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state sued the federal government Monday for $ 157 million in welfare reimbursements that state officials charge <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has illegally withheld. State social service officials charged in the lawsuit, filed in federal court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, that the federal government has refused to give state and its local governments money owed for five separate years, dating to 1979. The reimbursements are the federal share of the Aid for Families with Dependent Children program dealing with children placed in foster care. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Perales </PERSON> said federal officials have never acknowledged that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> filed for the reimbursements. `` We are paying. We are providing the service,'' <PERSON> Perales </PERSON> told reporters. `` The issue here is that the federal government is not paying its share.'' <PERSON> Perales </PERSON> said `` just about every other state is owed money'' totaling about $ 600 million. He mentioned <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as two states with a similar problem. `` We're talking about a system in which the federal government says, ` We're going to help you finance the care of your children in foster care,''' <PERSON> Perales </PERSON> said. `` We rely on that trust and relationship. ... We are relying on the good faith of the federal government.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said he had not seen the lawsuit and could not immediately comment. The agency, part the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, administers the foster care program. The $ 157 million consists of reimbursements the state claims it's owed for 1979, 1980, 1983, 1987 and 1988, <PERSON> Perales </PERSON> said. Some $ 50 million would go to the state, about $ 80 million would go to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and $ 27 million would go to other local governments, said state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>. The federal government estimates how much the state will need to run the foster care program each quarter. According to <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Perales </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is supposed to reimburse the state whenever actual costs for the quarter are higher than the federal estimate, but did n't in these cases. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, a Democrat, accused the Republican <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of trying to balance the federal deficit `` on the backs of those who can least afford to deal with that problem _ individuals who are vulnerable, who are disabled.''

<HEAD>No Shelter from the Tax Collector After a Nuclear Attack</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It will take something more than a nuclear attack to wipe out your obligations to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. However, an addition to the Internal Revenue Manual, which is supposed to guide the conduct of all <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employees, acknowledges that tax collection might suffer if the bomb is dropped. Once the emergency is over, the manual declares, `` operations will be concentrated on collecting the taxes which will produce the greater revenue yield.'' <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Johnell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said Monday that the new section _ titled `` <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION>'' _ was added to the manual in response to a directive to government departments from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The two-page policy statement is dated Dec. 14, 1988. `` In the event of a national emergency -LRB- especially resulting from nuclear attack -RRB- the primary function of the service is to support the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>,'' the manual states. `` This support as a minimum will consist of analyzing and reporting upon emergency tax legislation, prescribing regulations and forms, issuing rulings and technical information of an emergency nature.'' Within 30 days after an attack emergency, the agency would expect to resume assessing and collecting taxes. At that time, the manual states, many employees might find themselves reassigned to carry out essential functions `` regardless of and without any effect on the current positions or grades of the employee.'' `` On the premise that the collection of delinquent accounts would be most adversely affected, and in many cases would be impossible in a disaster area, the service will concentrate on the collection of current taxes,'' the manual says. `` However, in areas where the taxpaying potential is substantially unimpaired, enforced collection of delinquent accounts will be continued.''

<TEXT>
 Differences will remain between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> even after they resume normal diplomatic relations at their first summit in 30 years, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said Monday. Soviet support for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is regarded by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as the most serious obstacle to better ties between <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> said the issue will be high on the agenda when Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in May. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> told a news conference that the visit will lead to normal diplomatic relations, but there will still be `` some way to go and some efforts to be made'' before two countries resolve all their differences. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which supports the anti-Vietnamese resistance in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, backs the dispatch of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ends its 10-year occupation. He said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is not preparing to send troops to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> to participate in a proposed peacekeeping force. The Chinese-Soviet summit, the first since <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> met in 1959, follows the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> announcement this month it would withdraw of 75 percent the 50,000 Soviet forces from <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> _ two <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> moves to ease its long-strained relationship with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> later clashed over ideology, and Soviet and Chinese troops clashed in the 1960s and 1970s along the 4,670-mile border. At the news conference, <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said Sino-U.S. relations have progressed smoothly since diplomatic ties were formed a decade ago. Relations, he said, `` enjoy vast potential and the prospects are very good.'' But he also called on a `` new pattern'' of relations based on mutual trust, and had sharp words for members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who have criticized <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s lack of democratic reform and its human rights record in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. `` A small number of people in the American <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are actually very ill-informed about the situation in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. They have very strong prejudice.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last week criticized both the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for statements concerning the declaration of martial law in the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> following pro-independence riots this month. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> rioters were trying to split the Chinese nation and foreign nations that raise the human rights question are interfering in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. Human rights, he added, are a matter of basic questions such as providing adequate food and education and `` are inseparable with the actual condition of the country involved.'' He noted <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> still has 200 million illiterate people. `` There are things that can be easily achieved in some countries but not in others.''

 A travel service that arranges trips to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for Cuban exiles has been bombed, the 11th attack in two years on agencies that handle passengers and packages bound for the communist island. Federal and local authorities said Monday they are renewing their investigation of the case. Militant anticommunist Cuban exiles are the prime suspects in the bombings. Just before midnight Sunday two small bombs blasted holes in the outside wall of Marazul Charters, the only company authorized to handle trips for Cuban exiles wanting to visit their homeland. No one was hurt, but the explosion also shattered a window and light fixtures in businesses across a narrow canal. `` We're actively investigating, but we have n't identified a suspect yet,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszynski </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office. He said the <LOCATION> Metro-Dade </LOCATION> police bomb squad was gathering evidence to identify the detonation method for the two bombs. There have been 13 similar bombings in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area over the last two years _ 11 at agencies doing business with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, one aimed at an art museum showing work by Cuban artists and one at the home of the sponsor of a forum on U.S.-Cuban relations. Marazul's owner, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Aruca </PERSON>, has spoken in favor of closer relations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, an anathema to some in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s anti-Castro community. The bombings were the work of `` fanatical and radical elements in the community,'' <PERSON> Aruca </PERSON> said Monday. `` Anyone who perceives a softening of the attitude toward a dialogue with <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> can expect to have that happen to them.'' The bombing apparently did not frighten off Marazul's customers, who often have to wait months for seats on the twice-a-week charter flights to visit relatives in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` My husband would like to see his mother before she dies,'' <PERSON> Hilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Aybar </PERSON> said while waiting in front of the agency. `` I do n't see why he should n't go. Threats phoned to Marazul and other agencies criticize them for indirectly supporting <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> by providing hard currency to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, and more broadly by softening attitudes toward the communist government. The latest bombing came three days after another <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> agency announced the first direct mail to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, and two weeks after the Kiwanis Club of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, which sponsored <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s Calle Ocho street party, caused a controversy by banning any singers who had performed in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.

 The commander of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> units has asked President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to support his drive to expel all Syrian troops from his country, officials said Monday. In a letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said he was determined to achieve the withdrawal of all foreign troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who saw the letter. The official spoke only on condition he not be named. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> maintains 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, while <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> forces _ estimated to number about 1,000 _ and an allied Christian militia patrol a cordon of southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> along the border with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> contends the Syrians, who intervened in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> 13 years ago as peacekeepers, have turned into an occupation force by taking sides with Moslems and Druse. He heads a Christian military cabinet in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s divided government while <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> backs the rival Moslem government. In his campaign to drive out the Syrians, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> units have been engaged since March 8 in a fierce artillery battle in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with an alliance of Syrian troops and militiamen of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The fighting is considered the worst <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> has known in recent years. In his letter, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said `` he sees himself as the spearhead'' for removing Syrian forces and restoring the country's sovereignty, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. `` He wanted to gauge our reaction to this and our ability to assist,'' he added. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> did not ask for any specific help; rather he wants <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> understanding for his plan `` and moral support,'' the official said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be responding to the letter, likely reiterating the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position of neutrality in the conflict, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued two statements last week urging Christians, Moslems and Syrians to cease fire and negotiate, either directly or through the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are in contact with all sides in an obvious show of neutrality, but have refused to mediate after failing last year in mediation attempts between the Christians and Syrians.

<TEXT>
 Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> on Monday urged breaking down bureaucratic barriers between programs aimed at preventing school dropouts, saying a `` fragmented, piecemeal, programmatic approach'' does n't work. She began a 10-city fact-finding tour of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> regional offices during which she is meeting with officials and students in youth job training and employment programs. The tour ends April 4 in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` We need a way to tie together the programs both federally and most definitely at the community level,'' she told civic leaders, teachers and students in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s Exodus program, founded in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in 1971 to combat <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s 34 percent dropout rate. The program now is in 31 cities. She said her tour is designed to help learn which programs work and which do not. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said the information will be used to start programs to identify needs of individual students in 12 cities to be picked later. These are to be converted to model programs in five cities. She said current programs often overlap or duplicate each other and lack follow-up studies. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said much of what she referred to as the `` skills gap and the motivation gap'' is rooted in a time when there were fewer possibilities for young people in the job market and when expectations were lower. `` Everyone can have a job today who wants a job if he has the skills,'' she said. `` But you've got to have the skills. `` It's a new day,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` We've got a real mission here together to accomplish this.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said she believes her primary goal is to ensure that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has the best-trained labor force in the world. But she noted that youth unemployment nationally is at 16 percent and that minority youth unemployment is at 35 percent, or even higher in some areas. `` We must look at our own situation,'' she said, adding that she will urge other federal departments, such as Education and <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, to tie programs together with the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Are we training people for the jobs of yesterday or the jobs of tomorrow?''

<TEXT>
 Articles of impeachment were sent Monday to the full House against state Treasurer <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, who was charged with improper handling of a fund that lost $ 279 million and covering up the losses. Neither <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, 61, a popular, flamboyant Democrat in his second term as treasurer, nor his lawyer would comment immediately on the 17-7 vote by which the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> recommended 18 impeachment articles to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The committee also voted 22-3 to recommend censure of state Auditor <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gainer </PERSON> for his role in the losses in the consolidated investment fund, which was under the overall control in 1987 of a board upon which Gainer and <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> served. The fund was under the direct investment power of the treasurer. House Speaker <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said the 100-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is expected to take up the resolution Wednesday. A simple majority is needed to send it to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Senate President <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, anticipating <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>'s impeachment by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week to be prepared to sit as a jury in late May It would take 23 `` yes'' votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ two-thirds of the 34 members _ to convict. That could lead to <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>'s removal from office and loss of a pension estimated at at least $ 2,128 a month. The judiciary committee voted 19-6 last Wednesday to formalize 16 impeachment articles and the final vote on the document was taken Monday. Added Monday were articles charging that <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> put an unqualified person in control of the state's investment portfolio after two previous treasury employees left and that the treasurer's office charged for handling investments in the fund The articles charge <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> with failing to supervise the fund, delegation of his power and authority, making improper investments of state funds, paying out funds that were not earned, and covering up the losses, which occurred mainly in April, May and June 1987. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>'s chief defender on the committee, Delegate <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitrolo </PERSON>, said a minority report signed by six members is being prepared to present to the House. `` We do n't feel there is evidence to impeach,'' said <PERSON> Pitrolo </PERSON>. Gainer's censure motion, which amounts to a public reprimand, said he failed to adequately supervise the fund and to fulfill his public duties.

<TEXT>
 Americans are n't responding to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` thousand points of light'' message by giving more time and money to charity, a poll released Monday says. Most of the 1,010 people polled by the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> said they planned no changes in the time they volunteer to charity or money they give, said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Poughkeepsie </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as part of his call for a `` kinder and gentler'' <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, has asked Americans to give more time and money to charity. `` Most people feel that they are giving at their limit and are giving a fair amount,'' said <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, author of `` The Guaranteed Fund-Raising System.'' Half the people polled said they donate time to a religious group or civic or community organization. Eighty-five percent of Americans contribute money to churches, charities or civic groups, the poll found. Slightly more than two-thirds of the respondents said they'd give the same amount of time and money to charity in 1989 as they did last year The survey found 19 percent planned to give more money this year and 12 percent would give less, largely because they had more or less money to spend. Similarly, 83 percent of those who do n't volunteer time now do n't plan to change their habits, the survey found. `` The people who are in positions of leadership in this country, be they religious, political or civic leaders, are going to have to make a very clear case for additional giving and additional involvement,'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. Non-profit groups need to better show how the money and time makes a direct impact, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. Too many groups seem more preoccupied with their fund-raising than what the money is actually going to do, he said. `` The people who are involved and are already giving understand what the social needs are,'' he said. The survey, conducted by telephone in the lower 48 states from Jan. 29 to Feb. 1, also found that women are more likely than men to give time or money to charity. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.5 percent.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday urged the Marxist government of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to accept a peace proposal put forth by U.S.-backed rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>. The proposals by <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> of the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- `` are a significant step in that direction, and are deserving of broad support,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. She said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> urged the government in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> `` to respond positively to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>'s gestures and offer of peace.'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, who has been fighting the government for 14 years, has called a four-month halt to attacks on Cuban-aided government troops in order to bring about peace talks. He also has pledged not to interfere with reconstruction of the strategic east-west <LOCATION> Benguela </LOCATION> railway, destroyed by rebel attacks, and he said he would be willing to release 100 captured government soldiers. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which gives <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> an estimated $ 15 million in weapons annually, has been embarrassed by recent reports of human rights violations by <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> has denied the reports, which include allegations that he ordered the torture and killings of rebel dissidents, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say they are investigating. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> wants to take advantage of a recently signed, U.S.-sponsored agreement for the withdrawal of Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in order to start talks on power sharing with the government. But so far, the government has refused to negotiate with the rebels, even though there is little prospect for a military victory by either side. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> acknowledges he can not win a conventional war against the Cuban-backed government forces, but his rebels have for years controlled about a third of the country.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that either ordinary lactose _ milk sugar _ or another sugar from a <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> plant can sharply reduce the amount of common food poisoning bacteria in the intestines of chickens destined for the consumer market. Preliminary tests showed that the number of salmonella bacteria in infected chickens can be reduced in a significant number of the birds by 99.9 percent for a cost of pennies a day, said <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> biochemist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLoach </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, College Station, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> DeLoach </PERSON> said in a report issued here by the agency that lactose and D-mannose were added to the drinking water of chicks dosed with 100 million Salmonella typhirmurium bacteria. When the 10-day-old chicks were compared with birds that had received the bacteria but no sugars, only 53 percent of the birds on lactose and only 26 percent of those on D-mannose had any salmonella bacteria, he said. `` It's not only important how many birds had salmonella, but how many salmonella bacteria those birds had,'' <PERSON> DeLoach </PERSON> said. `` The birds treated with either mannose or lactose had 99.9 percent fewer salmonella than the control birds in those experiments.'' <PERSON> DeLoach </PERSON> added: `` Lactose worked just as well as mannose, and the cost of lactose in drinking water might be no more than two cents per bird. Right now, if the poultry producer put his birds on D-mannose for 10 days, it would cost him 50 cents a bird.'' The exact amount of bacterial contamination in poultry is unclear, but <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> and private estimates have ranged from 35 percent to 60 percent nationally. Salmonella and other organisms can be spread when slaughtered birds are put through eviscerating machines and their intestinal contents are spilled. <PERSON> DeLoach </PERSON> was part of a team studying salmonella at the agency's veterinary toxicology research unit at College Station D-mannose is produced naturally by the Fraxinus ornus plant along the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> basin </LOCATION>, the report said. The sugar _ seminose and carubinose _ is available commercially in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A sister compound, mannitol, has been used for years as a stabilizer and preservative in pharmaceutical products. The report said D-mannose reduces the ability of salmonella bacteria to settle in a chicken's intestines, forcing the organisms to pass harmlessly out of the bird. Studies are still under way on how lactose works.

 Thousands of volunteers are being used to help farmers comply with new federal conservation requirements, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. A record 8,222 volunteers helped the department's <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in the 1988 fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30, almost a four-fold increase from 2,223 the previous year. Wilson Scaling, chief of the agency, said the unpaid helpers will be recognized during National Volunteer Week, April 9-15. `` We're in the midst of one of the biggest conservation efforts in history, and volunteers andre playing a key role,'' he said. Scaling referred to provisions in the 1985 farm law requiring farmers with highly erodible crop land to have a conservation plan approved by the agency no later than Dec. 31, 1989, and to have it implemented by Dec. 31, 1994. The volunteers, called the Earth Team by the agency, include college students to retired people. They're used for a variety of jobs, including design and layout of conservation practices on individual farms, educational activities, and computer and general office assistance. Scaling said anyone interested in joining the program can call a toll-free number, 1-800-THE SOIL to find out more information, or they can contact local <ORGANIZATION> SCS </ORGANIZATION> offices, which are located in nearly all counties.

<TEXT>
 The 220,000-ton tanker <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cadiz </ORGANIZATION>, owned by a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, ran aground March 16, 1978, after tow lines snapped, impaling the vessel on rocks two miles off the western French coast. At least 68 million gallons of light Gulf crude oil spilled out along about 100 miles of <LOCATION> Brittany </LOCATION> coastline. The spill created an oil slick 18 miles wide and 80 miles long, blackened beaches, and killed thousands of birds and millions of sea creatures. Local industries such as tourism, fishing, and particularly the oyster industry, were seriously affected. The French government has paid out as much as $ 100 million in clean-up costs and compensation to those affected by the spill. In February, a judge recommended a $ 115.2 million judgment against <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, with the French government slated to recieve $ 44.4 million and affected towns about $ 7.5 million. Today, <PERSON> Brittany </PERSON>'s beaches are again clean, the fishermen are at work again and the oyster beds productive. But insidious damages, like the death of small animals which other fish had fed from, have caused the gradual disappearance of certain species, and officials say the total fallout from the pollution has not yet been evaluated.

<TEXT>
 The Argo Merchant, a Liberian tanker, was lost in the early morning darkness on Dec. 15, 1976, when it ran onto a shoal off <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Winds and waves battered the ship while the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> tried to save it. The tanker leaked oil until it finally broke apart nine days later and lost the rest of its cargo. A total of 7.6 million gallons of residual oil -LRB- not crude -RRB- were spilled. Winds were blowing offshore, and the oil drifted into the open ocean. A few months later, no oil could be found on the ocean bottom. No serious harm to the waters or fish were detected. In 1980, a federal court ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> Argo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> was an unsafe ship, citing general mismanagement, neglect, and navigation errors.

<NOTE>PACIFIC NORTHWEST-BARGE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Approximately 231,000 gallons of heavy bunker oil spilled from a barge off the southwest <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coast on Dec. 22, 1988, after the tug towing the barge struck it while maneuvering to secure a towing line. The spill fooled officials, who predicted it would be broken up in heavy seas. However, a few days after the accident, a storm pushed the oil back toward land, where it washed up on hundreds of miles of beaches, including pristine wilderness beaches in Olympic National Park and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s Pacific Rim National Park. A massive cleanup effort followed, involving professional and volunteer crews. Still, up to 10,000 birds died and effects of the pollution will linger for years. The <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> company whose tug was towing the barge, <ORGANIZATION> Sause </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to pay cleanup costs. The state's cost to date is $ 350,000, of which <ORGANIZATION> Sause </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> has paid $ 115,000 A marine resource damage-assessment team is investigating the spill's effects on everything from surf smelt and sea otters, to subsistence seafood harvesting by Indian tribes. A price tag will be put on the whole package, including a cost per dead bird and for such ephemeral items as lost recreational opportunities.

 A decade of bargaining between the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and a federal workers' union has ended with the military offering child care to the command's 83,000 civilian employees nationwide. The <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> since 1978 had sought <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> funding for union-operated day care for children of civilian <ORGANIZATION> AFLC </ORGANIZATION> employees. The agreement gives control to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, which by October will expand its existing <ORGANIZATION> AFLC </ORGANIZATION> child-care facilities and offer them to all families of civilian workers. Families of uniformed personnel in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, as in other services, have had access to subsidized day care for decades. The initial cost of expanding the service, which officials wo n't disclose, will be borne by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Operating costs for civilian child care will be paid by parents who enroll their children, and service fees will be set by each base, according to officials at the command's headquarters at <ORGANIZATION> Wright-Patterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The agreement was reached Feb. 27 with little publicity. On Monday the <ORGANIZATION> Macon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; News ran an account of how the agreement will affect the command's 15,100 employees at <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in central <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Robins </LOCATION>, 20 civilians are on a waiting list for day care, which accommodates 32 children of civilians along with 142 dependents of military personnel, said base commander <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Edenfield </PERSON>. The first priority for on-base child care has been for military families, and just 1,000 children of civilian workers are enrolled in the AFLC centers nationwide, said <ORGANIZATION> AFLC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrotte </PERSON>. Along with <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>, expanded day-care centers will be established at five air logistics centers: <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 At least 33 people have been arrested in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in a multimillion-dollar, interstate sports betting ring, state and federal officials announced Monday. Those arrested allegedly accepted or placed bets in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with an operation based in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars on events in college and professional basketball, football and baseball, and horse races. While arrests were made in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> was seizing six facilities associated with the operation and began serving search warrants on suspected leaders of the organization, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonacci </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s statewide prosecutor. Phone taps were used in the investigation, which began in late 1987. `` We've got calls where thousands were bet by one person on one game,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Marblestone </PERSON>, assistant statewide prosecutor. `` We're not talking people betting 10, 20, 30 bucks.'' Arrested and accused of leading the operation's <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> division were <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>, 45 and his wife, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. According to information gathered through the wiretaps, the <ORGANIZATION> Kopps </ORGANIZATION> were salaried employees of the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> organization and earned $ 150,000 a year, said <PERSON> Marblestone </PERSON>. They face charges of racketeering, conspiracy to commit racketeering and 30 counts of bookmaking. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>'s bond was set at $ 250,000 and Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>'s was set at $ 50,000. If convicted, <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> faces up to 22 years in prison and Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> faces up to seven years, said <PERSON> Marblestone </PERSON>. Most of the other people arrested were bettors. They face misdemeanor charges.

<HEAD>Government Claims Guerrilla Attack on Jalalabad Collapsing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials said Monday the attack by Moslem guerrillas around <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> was collapsing and the rest of the country was `` very calm and quiet.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman would not rule out the possibility, however, that the guerrillas were regrouping to continue the fight at <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, their first major offensive since Soviet military forces withdrew Feb. 15. In <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, a guerrilla group claimed 53 soldiers were killed and five aircraft shot down in weekend fighting around the strategic city on the main road from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to the Pakistani border. The Afghan News Agency, associated with rebel leader <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, said insurgents had captured several army posts north of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> in heavy fighting since Saturday. It gave no figures on guerrilla casualties, but on Sunday the official Afghan radio said nearly 350 were killed. Claims by the two sides usually conflict, and no independent confirmation is possible. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, said guerrillas fired only 250 rockets and shells at <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> in the 24-hour period ending at sundown Monday, compared with 12,000 in the previous 24 hours. `` Our armed forces detected their place of attack and shelled -LRB- them -RRB-,'' he told reporters. `` As a result, 190 of the extremists were killed and 70 were wounded.'' He said two government soldiers and three civilians were killed and five soldiers and nine civilians wounded. `` Extremists'' is what the government calls the guerrillas who begqan fighting after a communist coup in April 1978. Soviet soldiers arrived in December 1979, and an estimated 115,000 were in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> when the U.N.-mediated withdrawal began last May. Despite the lull he reported in fighting at <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said it was too soon for foreign journalists to visit. Asked whether the reported decline in guerrilla activity could mean they were regrouping for a fresh attack, he said: `` We're of the opinion that they are drawing a conclusion that they can not achieve any success through military means,'' but whether they would attack again was open to question. A guerrilla victory there would give them control of their first major city and provide a base for the `` interim government'' they elected Feb. 23 in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` Except for minor military activities in border provinces, including <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION>, the rest of the nation led a very calm and quiet life,'' and at <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> the attacks are `` weakening and disintegrating,'' he said. <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> is near the the border with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s neighbor to the west and the base for eight predominantly Shiite Moslem insurgent groups. The Shiites frequently are at odds with the seven predominantly Sunni Moslem groups that operate from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> claimed Pakistani miitiamen and advisers from <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> had been killed fighting with the guerrillas, but he gave no figures. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON>, a rebel commander outside <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, claimed in a report mailed to news organizaions that <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> military advisers and pilots were with Afghan forces near the Soviet border. Officials in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> often claim Pakistani troops, along with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> military advisers, help the insurgents. All three countries acknowledge supporting the guerrillas but deny direct involvement. Previous guerrilla reports have said Indian and Soviet pilots were bombing their forces, but both countries deny it. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said he was incorrctly informed Sunday when he told reporters all passengers on two small buses were killed by guerrilla rocket attacks. He said `` a number'' survived and were in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> hospitals. One attack occurred on the Jalalabad-Kabul highway and the other on the road linking <LOCATION> kabul </LOCATION> with the northeastern province of <LOCATION> Laghman </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, a city of 2.2 million, was quiet Monday and has been for a week.

<HEAD>Bush Urged To Move Fast To Avert New Trade Deficit Spiral</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The improving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, the biggest factor promoting domestic growth last year, is on the verge of stalling out unless the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration moves quickly to devalue the dollar and reach a budget agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a research institute warned Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> said that unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is able to get its trade problems under control, the country faces the threat of a recession, triggered by the flight of foreigners from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments. There is also a danger that rising trade deficit would force <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration to erect protectionist trade barriers that would threaten a global trade war, according to the study, `` American Trade Adjustment: the Global Impact.'' The report said without needed policy changes, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trade deficit will begin rising again in 1990 and by 1992 will surpass the record imbalance of $ 154 billion set in 1987. The forecast covers the current account, the broadest measure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade, because it includes not only trade in merchandise but also trade in services, primarily investment flows between countries. The current account deficit shrank 12 percent to $ 135 billion in 1988 as a boom in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export sales accounted for almost half of total economic growth last year. The report said this improvement was about to stall out because high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption spending was continuing to pull in imports while the dollar's value was not low enough to spur further gains in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export sales. The report recommended that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration persuade <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s major allies to accept a further devaluation of the dollar. It said the dollar needed to drop another 25 percent against the yen and another 20 percent against the West German mark. Since February 1987, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has promoted a dollar-stabilization effort in the face of protests from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies, including <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, that the greenback already had fallen enough from its highs in 1985. The report called on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to meet the targets of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, which calls for a balanced budget by 1993. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>, a senior fellow at the institute and the author of the report, said a reduction in the federal budget deficit would dampen the growth of domestic demand in this country and thus reduce <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s appetite for foreign goods. The study said if the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> act quickly to implement the budget cuts, it would accomplish the shift from a consumption-driven economy to an export-driven economy without a recession. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergsten </PERSON>, director of the institute, said the risks of a recession are greater now because in the past three years <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has borrowed an additional $ 428 billion from the rest of the world to finance its huge current account deficits. Those deficits mean that Americans are handing over billions of dollars to foreigners to pay for imported products. Unless the trade improvements are resumed, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s net debt will top $ 1 trillion by the end of 1992, the report forecast. The net debt represents the excess in foreign investments in this country over what Americans own overseas. The growing debt burdens run the risk of a `` collapse of confidence in the dollar, triggering a further surge of inflation and interest rates _ and possibly a recession,'' the report said. <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> said the administration should have as a goal lowering the current account deficit from $ 150 billion to an annual rate of $ 50 billion, which he said was a more realistic figure than trying for total elimination of the deficit. The report, which used computer models to simulate global trade flows, reached these other conclusions: _ The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit would drop by $ 9 billion to $ 13 billion in 1992 for every percentage point boost in growth in the economies of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s major trading partners _ The trade deficit would narrow by between $ 8 billion and $ 10 billion in 1992 for every percentage point decline in the dollar's exchange rate The report said the trade-weighted value of the dollar against all currencies needed to fall by 10 percent. _ The trade deficit would improve by $ 15 billion for every percentage point drop in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economic growth rate, reflecting a lower demand for imports The institute is a non-partisan research organization which specializes in studies of international economic issues. It receives its financial support from private foundations and corporations, both in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and overseas.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> completed a stunning political comeback with his landslide victory over a candidate who symbolized power and prestige. Yet, his broad base of political support translates to little real power in his bid to challenge the government and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> bureaucracy. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> rolled up more than 89 percent of the vote to defeat technocrat <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON> for a seat representing all of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in Sunday's first multicandidate national balloting in 70 years of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> power. Together with the defeats of high-ranking officials in other areas of the country, it is a warning of popular discontent with entrenched officials and their privileges. The victory restored the burly, 58-year-old Sverdlovsk native to a place of prominence in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, giving the onetime protege of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a parliamentary seat representing the city he used to run as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief. But it is only one of 2,250 seats in a body that meets once a year to elect a president and a new, more active legislative body: the Supreme Soviet. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said he wants all members of the congress to serve one year of their five-year terms in the Supreme Soviet, but there is no guarantee when <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> will be elected to the practically full-time lawmaking body. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> has been on the outs politically since losing his job in November 1987 following his blunt criticism of the party's style of leadership and warnings of a Stalin-like cult developing around <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. During his populist campaign against the privileges of the party elite and the failure of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms to put food on the tables of ordinary people, however, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was careful not to challenge <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s leadership. He repeated that disclaimer after his victory. `` I did n't consider myself, I do n't consider myself, and I do n't want to be an alternative candidate to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told hundreds of workers Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, where he serves as first deputy chairman Accused in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of advocating a multiparty system, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> has denied the charge and said it was an effort to undermine his campaign. But he gave a clue about how he plans to push his program, saying deputies must form interest groups if they expect to accomplish anything. `` It is impossible to carry out 2,250 programs, as many as there are deputies,'' he said Monday. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said he foresaw `` some based on ecology, some on social issues, some on the economy. In this way they can be formed to strengthen that trend, that voice.'' `` And just the opposite, they can stand as a strong barrier against those trends that people do n't need, which hurt our people and the government too,'' he said. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> ran hard in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s most visible electoral district against what he said is an entrenched power structure that enjoys special privileges while creating shortages for the masses by mismanaging the economy. He said the leadership has failed to meet its top priority of improving living conditions because reforms have not gone far enough. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> campaigned for eliminating most government ministries and cutting the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> bureaucracy to improve local autonomy. His campaign was built on his popularity gained while serving as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Communist Party chief in 1985-87. It also served as a lightning rod for discontent that is surfacing as Soviets are increasingly allowed to voice their opinions. <PERSON> Yevgeniya </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonkonovye </PERSON>, 62, said Sunday that she voted for <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> because he visited the clinic where she worked and because he used public transportation. `` You feel his earthiness,'' she said. <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON>, in contrast, came across less naturally and recited a campaign program that closely followed mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> calls for improved food and consumer goods. In his short term as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was a close supporter of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, especially of his calls for greater openness. But it was <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> who criticized his one-time protege for being overly ambitious and presided over the meeting at which <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was fired. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> has criticized <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s electoral reforms as not being democratic enough, and he chastised the party for nominating 100 candidates for an equal number of seats in the congress. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was among the 100. In contrast, three-quarters of the 1,500 congress members chosen Sunday had competition. `` Democracy in society has gotten ahead of democracy in the party, judging by the election law,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s popularity with a program that criticized Communist Party policies could conceivably help <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and the Soviet leader appeared to acknowledge that in comments he made to correspondents after voting Sunday. Asked about the charges made against <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> in the final days of the campaign, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party leader must be willing to accept criticism along with everyone else in a freer atmosphere. But he also said those who supported <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s attacks on bureaucracy were ardent supporters of continuing reforms. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might be able to use the strong showing by <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and losses suffered by conservatives elsewhere to show the conservatives still in the power structure thatay \* # \* \* # \* \* # \* 88.50 \* \* \* Jul \* # \* \* # \* \* # \* 87.00 \* \* \* Sep \* # \* \* # \* \* # \* 84.25 \* \* \* Dec \* # \* \* # \* \* # \* 82.25 \* \* \* Jan \* # \* \* # \* \* # \* 78.75 \* \* \* Mar \* # \* \* # \* \* # \* 78.75 \* \* \* May \* # \* \* # \* \* # \* 78.75 \* \* \* Jul \* # \* \* # \* \* # \* 78.75 \* \* \* Sep \* # \* \* # \* \* # \* 78.75 \* \* \* Dec \* # \* \* # \* \* # \* 78.75 \* \* \* Jan \* # \* \* # \* \* # \* 78.75 \* \* \* Fri.'s open int 145.

Astronaut <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabe </PERSON>, who will pilot the shuttle Atlantis, noted that <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> will be the first American planetary launch in 12 years and the first from the shuttle. `` The planetary program has been dormant for some time,'' he said. `` So <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> will be a very fullfilling flight for us. Not only when we launch it, but 15 months later when it orbits <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>.'' Astronaut <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who will command the flight, said the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> flight is a `` logical marriage between the manned and unmanned space programs.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> and his four Atlantis crew members held a news conference to discuss the four-day flight, scheduled for launch from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, on April 28. Six hours after Atlantis lifts off, astronauts <PERSON> Thagard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> are to release the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft from the cargo bay. An hour later, a payload rocket motor is to ignite to start the 8,000-pound probe on a 466-day voyage to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> is to reach <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> on Aug. 10, 1990, swooping into orbit to begin 243 days of mapping the entire surface of the planet with high-resolution radar. `` Venus is our closest neighbor in terms of space, mass and size,'' <PERSON> Thagard </PERSON> said. `` Planetary science is very important to learning how the Earth evolved and what is going on here. <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> is another data point. We worry about the greenhouse effect here on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> could tell us if there are any parallels between <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>.'' Although Earth and <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> were almost identical at the beginning of the solar system, some 4.6 billion years ago, they evolved very differently. Today, <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> has a surface temperature of 900 degrees and is shrouded in a cloudy atmosphere. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleave </PERSON>, a mission specialist on next month's mission, said <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>'s radar images could show whether <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> has shifting crustal plates similar to those that sometimes cause earthquakes. `` Being a civil engineer and interested in the design of buildings that could withstand earthquakes, I would like to know more about plate tectonics,'' she said. `` Because there is no water on <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, the radar can look at the entire planet and this might help us understand plate tectonics on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> also could answer questions about the extent of volcanic activity on <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and whether the planet ever had oceans.

<TEXT>
 The city is getting tough on the pugnacious pit bull dog, barring the breed from taking up future residence and requiring photos and tattoos of those already here. The <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> adopted a Health Code amendment Monday that requires that all pit bull terriers be registered, spayed or neutered and identified by photographs and tattooing. The regulations, which go into effect in 30 days, also require that the animals be muzzled whenever there is any potential contact with the public, that they be on a leash when outside the owner's home and that signs be posted on the premises indicating the presence of a pit bull The terriers, which were long ago bred to battle bulls for sport, have been known to turn on humans without warning and bite or maul them. Registration of all pit bulls with the city <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> must take place before Oct. 1, and owners must have proof of liability insurance of at least $ 100,000. Unregistered pit bulls can be seized and owners face fines of up to $ 500 a day, said department spokesman <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON>. `` After October first,'' he said, `` there will be no pit bulls allowed into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. ... Eventually, there will come a time when there will be no pit bulls in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said the only figures he had available on deaths from dog attacks indicated that from 1983 to August 1987, there were 29 deaths nationally and 21 of those were caused by pit bulls.

<TEXT>
 Crimes motivated by bigotry are more violent than previously assumed, according to a study released Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` The idea that a civil rights violation consists of kids painting graffiti on a church or throwing a rock through a window does not describe the type of incidents reported to the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police,'' Professor <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> McDevitt </PERSON> wrote in his study for the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` More than 50 percent of the incidents of racial violence identified in our study are acts of a very serious and potentially injury-resulting character.'' The study examined 452 crimes reported from 1983 to 1987 and identified by the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disorders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> as motivated by bigotry. The crimes included whites assaulting a white boyfriend of a black female, bricks thrown through windows, a swastika painted on a synagogue and assaults on homosexuals. Fifty-three percent of the crimes were categorized as physical assaults, and 47 percent as property damage. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON>, research director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prejudice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violence </ORGANIZATION>, an independent organization in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, called the Northeastern study `` the first really decent analysis of hard data.' Such research reinforces findings of the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> institute that one out of four or five minority persons will be victimized during the course of a year, he said. `` It's very underreported,'' <PERSON> McDevitt </PERSON> said. `` Victims fear retaliation. And victims will deny it's a hate crime. If you feel you're a victim because of your religion or your color, then each time you step out the door -LRB- you fear -RRB- you're going to be attacked.'' Among the findings: _ Sixty-three percent of the racial incidents were perpetrated by whites, 33 percent by blacks Four percent of such offenses were committed by people of Hispanic or Asian origin. _ The largest percentage of victims _ 35 percent _ were white, followed by blacks, 32 percent; Vietnamese, 12 percent, other Asian, 11 percent; Hispanics, including Portuguese, 7 percent; and Jews, 1 percent Nearly one-third of the victims were female. _ In 30 percent of the cases, victims were told they were being attacked because they `` did not belong'' in a neighborhood _ 64 percent of the racial attacks were committed by more than one individual and most involved four or more people ganging up against a lone victim <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON> said it's estimated that up to 70 percent of such crimes, including verbal assaults, are never reported. But he said society can work to get rid of bigotry. `` Prejudice is learned. What confuses people is that, because it's learned so early, they believe it's innate or natural. Understanding that it's a learned attitude lets us understand that we can change attitudes,'' <PERSON> Erhlich </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his wife, children and grandchildren joined thousands of youngsters on the sunlit South Lawn of the White House Monday for an Easter egg roll lacking much of the commercialization of recent years. `` What we were trying to do was basically bring back good kid entertainment and take some of the commercial out of it,'' said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Romash </PERSON> of the White House visitors center. Ms. <PERSON> Romash </PERSON> said White House security estimated nearly 40,000 children and parents came through the gates for this year's event, about 5,000 more than last year. The Bushes were accompanied by two of their children, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> and <PERSON> Doro </PERSON>, and six grandchildren. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> hid wooden eggs in straw for younger children, and his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, and 10-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON>, read stories. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, wife of White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, also joined the story readers. Actor <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeve </PERSON> and his two sons, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>, joined the first family at the egg roll, as did actors playing Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf from the Broadway show `` Into the Woods.'' The president squatted down to explain to 2-year-old granddaughter <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBlond </PERSON> how to use a plastic kitchen spoon to roll a hard-boiled egg 20 or so feet down a lane drawn on the White House lawn for the occasion. Then he blew a whistle to start the round. Egg-rolling is a technique that may have fallen into disuse since 1878, when the children of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> persuaded President <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> to allow them to compete at the White House after they had been banned from the grounds of the Capitol. The eggs are to stay rolling through the lush grass for the distance, but some of the older children _ the top age allowed is 8 _ sailed their eggs across the finish line with one flick at the whistle. Some of the littlest competitors needed help from a parent. No one seemed to be keeping track of who won the events, but it did n't matter, because all the participants in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> egg rolls win a souvenir wooden egg. This year they bore the signatures of the first couple. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talked with <PERSON> Reeve </PERSON>, bystanders and others, then blew the whistle for a second race. At its conclusion, he headed back to the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, shaking hands along the way. `` Our goals this year were to, one, accentuate the family because that is so much of the Bushes and, two, increase the involvement of the kids in the basic activities that they come for,'' Ms. <PERSON> Romash </PERSON> said. `` A Family Easter at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, 1989'' said the brochure and sticker given each child upon arrival. Afterward, each was given a single Easter Card with a story about the Easter Bunny, not the bags of candy and other goodies of recent years. Gone were the actors dressed up as TV cartoon characters or well-known brands of candy that were a feature of the event during the years <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lived in the White House. Instead, clowns, some volunteers from the <LOCATION> Ringling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bros. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Barnum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Bailey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circus </LOCATION>, made up the bulk of the costumed entertainers who mingled with the little ones this year, distributing helium-filled balloons of pink, yellow or white and signing autographs. It was a day with much standing in line for most guests, an average of two hours just to get in plus additional waits to participate in the most popular events.

<HEAD>Hairless Calf Survives Winter With Flannel Shirts But Faces Sunburn
Risk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HILLMAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A rare Holstein calf born without hair has survived its first month by wearing flannel shirts and leg wraps, but it now faces the risk of fatal sunburn as summer approaches. `` The local vet has been here a couple of times to look at him and he said he's seen calves with two heads or five legs, but he's never had to deal with one that does n't have any hair,'' said <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoheisel </PERSON>, the owner of <LOCATION> Baldy </LOCATION> Except for a small patch of fur on its hind quarters and two wispy tufts on its forehead, the <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON> farmer's cow is as bald as a cue ball. It does n't even have eyelashes. `` When it was born, he reminded me of one of those little baby mice without any hair,'' said <PERSON> Hoheisel </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON>. Raising a hairless calf has posed some unusual problems. <PERSON> Baldy </PERSON> eats considerably more than most calves his age, yet he stays surprisingly svelte. Almost all of his food energy is consumed in keeping warm and not much is left for growing, the <PERSON> Hoheisels </PERSON> said. To warm Baldy, the owners have outfitted him in old flannel shirts. And because he bruises and cuts easily, Mrs. <PERSON> Hoheisel </PERSON> has fitted him with leg wraps. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Spurrell </PERSON>, a doctor who specializes in animal reproduction, or theriogenology, at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Baldy </PERSON> likely is showing signs of hypotrichosis-congenita, an extremely rare genetic mutation `` Most calves like this die shortly after birth, so a calf living even this long is highly unusual,'' <PERSON> Spurrell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baldy </PERSON>'s long-term prognosis will not improve much as summer approaches, <PERSON> Spurrell </PERSON> said. The animal's weight may increase, but because of the lack of hair, the calf will be highly susceptible to severe sunburn and accompanying infection. <PERSON> Spurrell </PERSON> said he doubts that <PERSON> Baldy </PERSON> could gradually adapt to longer exposure to the sun the way people do _ by becoming tan. `` As long as he's healthy and not suffering, we're in no rush to get rid of him,'' <PERSON> Hoheisel </PERSON> said. `` Being as rare as he is, he's kind of nice to have around.

<HEAD>Britain's Thatcher Suggests Israel Talk to Opponents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said Monday that the need to resolve the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> crisis has never been more urgent and suggested that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> consider talking to its opponents. She addressed a banquet given by Morrocan King <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> at the start of an African tour that also will take her to <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> noted <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>'s 1986 meeting with then-Israeli Premier <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, which drew fire from some other Arab nations. `` Nothing is ever lost by exploring the views of one's opponents,'' she said `` That is an example from which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> can learn.'' The remark appeared to be another suggestion that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> meet with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. British Foreign Office Minister <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON> said on a visit to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last month that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders should accept the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a negotiating partner. <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON> met in January with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a terrorist organization despite <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s renunciation of terrorism in December and his recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, a move that opened the way for the U.S.-PLO dialogue now in progress. `` Never has the need for a solution -LRB- to the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict -RRB- been more urgent,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told the royal banquet. `` The proliferation of weapons, including chemical weapons and the ballistic missiles to deliver them, brings home to us the horrors of a further conflict. `` No one should be in doubt that the present situation in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is fundamentally unstable and can not continue.'' She said an international conference would provide the `` right'' framework for negotiations. Successful negotiations must include `` the direct involvement of representatives of the Palestinian people from inside and outside the occupied territories,'' she said, as well as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> influence with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and support of the permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> comprise the five permanent members. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said she would like to see <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> make a cooperative effort to bring the Israelis and Palestinians together. Her talks with <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> were to focus on the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION>, British-Moroccan ties and Moroccan relations with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. In an interview with the official Moroccan news agency MAP, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> expressed her assent with <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s wish for strengthened economic ties with the EEC. <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> has vainly sought entry into the trading bloc. Greeted at the rain-drenched airport by Premier <PERSON> Azzedine </PERSON> <PERSON> Laraki </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was ceremonially offered a bowl of milk and dates upon her arrival Monday before attending a luncheon given by <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>'s wife and three daughters. The British prime minister's aides said before her departure that she would launch a southern African peace initiative during her one-week trip. She said in a radio interview broadcast on Saturday, however, that she could not go to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> until <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, jailed leader of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, is released.

<TEXT>
 A massive mudslide closed the main road to Cedar Breaks National Monument and stripped off a half-mile section of pavement, and it continued to ooze downhill Monday, authorities said. The slide, roughly half a mile long and half a mile wide, sent mud and boulders cascading across State Road 14 sometime during the night and was discovered Monday morning, said <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. No injuries were reported. The highway had been heavily traveled during the Easter weekend, the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> said. No one was stranded at the monument because other roads lead from the monument back to main roads. The slide pushed an unoccupied road grader off the road. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said it also blocked a section of <LOCATION> Coal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, which runs through the canyon eight miles east of <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, but no serious flooding was reported. The slide continued to move but did not appear to be a threat. The movement was `` barely perceptible to the eye,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Tippetts </PERSON>, communications supervisor for the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. State road crews expected to open a detour around the slide area Tuesday after plowing snow from two sections of rural roads that been closed through the winter, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. The area received heavy rain and snow during the weekend, said meteorologist <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alder </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. It was n't immediately known if the precipitation triggered the slide, but <PERSON> Alder </PERSON> said `` that's probably what loosened the soil.'' A weather gauge at nearby <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> reported 10 inches of snow, while <LOCATION> Zion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, 15 miles to the south, reported 0.54 of an inch of rain, <PERSON> Alder </PERSON> said. Cedar Breaks is a natural amphitheater a half-mile deep and two miles wide, with cliffs eroded into pinnacles and ridges in a variety of colors. It was named by Mormon pioneers, who called its rugged topography `` breaks'' and mistook its juniper trees for cedars.

 <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and other anti-establishment candidates rode a wave of popular discontent to victory in parliamentary elections that gave Soviet voters their first real choice, according to returns Monday. Communist Party chiefs in the nation's second - and third-largest cities were defeated in Sunday's voting, and a top member of the Soviet leadership apparently was rejected in his home district where he ran unopposed Results trickling in from across the country indicated Soviets took advantage of new electoral freedom to express their dissatisfaction with shortages of food and consumer goods, rising prices, the bureaucracy and officials who promise reform. The winners will join those picked earlier by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and other organizations in a new 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. The parliament is still certain to be dominated by the ruling party and an entrenched <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership that assured itself of seats without having to face opposition at the polls. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the burly, 58-year-old former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss, won a landslide victory after a populist campaign against the special privileges afforded the party elite at a time when most people can find practically nothing in their stores. The one-time <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> protege amassed 89.4 percent of the vote against <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON>, a factory director, in a race for a seat to represent all of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s election commission. <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON>, 51, who also campaigned for improvements in the food supply but whose factory makes the ZIL limousines that symbolize privilege, received just 6.9 percent of the vote, <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s win marked a stunning political comeback following his dramatic fall from grace in 1987, when he was ousted as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief and later fired as a non-voting member of the ruling Politburo. He was accused of political mistakes and personal ambition after he criticized his fellow leaders and complained that perestroika, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform program, had not fulfilled the people's needs. `` It's hard to say what my spirit is more full of, joy or concern about what I realistically can do to help Muscovites,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told hundreds of workers at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, where he still holds ministerial rank despite his ouster from the party's top ranks. The workers applauded warmly. But <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s victory carries little power. The congress to which he was elected will meet just once a year to elect a president and a fraction of its own membership to a full-time legislature, the Supreme Soviet. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said he wants all members of the congress to serve one year of their five-year terms in the Supreme Soviet, but there is no guarantee when <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> will move up to the lawmaking body. The congress will be made up of 1,500 deputies elected in Sunday's territorial balloting and 750 members chosen earlier by various party, social and professional organizations. Elsewhere, other longtime office holders who traditionally won in uncontested elections went down to defeat. <ORGANIZATION> Leningrad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> lost overwhelmingly to a shipbuilder who took 74 percent of the vote in the nation's second-largest city, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. In an apparent defeat for a Politburo member, the name of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> regional party chief <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON> was omitted from a <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> list of victorious parliamentary candidates, local journalists said. <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON>, one of eight non-voting members of the 20-man Politburo, had no opponent in the parliamentary race, but voters had the choice of voting against any candidate by crossing out the name on the ballot. Another loser was <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Masik </PERSON>, regional party chief in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s third-largest city and capital of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said.

 An aerospace company employee who received a transplanted kidney was recuperating well Monday, thankful that he was rushed by helicopter from a remote desert camp in time for the surgery. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON>, 47, `` is doing great. He's awake, alert and reading the newspaper,'' his son, 23-year-old <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON>, said by phone from <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>. `` He's pretty happy about the new kidney. We're all happy.'' The elder <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON> was upgraded from critical to serious condition, and showed no sign of rejecting his new kidney, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayala </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> said his father expected to be discharged within two weeks. He underwent transplant surgery Sunday after an urgent ground and air search to find him once the donor kidney became available on Saturday. He was some 200 miles from the hospital when he was found. <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, and 25-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, were camping in a remote <LOCATION> Imperial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> area near the U.S.-Mexico border, when they finally were located early Sunday by <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON> and Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> KNX-AM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> radio helicopter pilot <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Tur </PERSON>. `` He's very thankful, especially to <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Tur </PERSON> and his helicopter,'' <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON>, an accounting manager at <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, wore a paging device so hospital officials could locate him, but he was well out of its range. Because <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON>'s blood type is shared by only 15 percent of the population, `` doctors said it could be years before a kidney became available,'' the son said. `` It was just a fluke one with the right blood type became available so quickly.'' <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> drove 100 mph to the <LOCATION> Imperial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, while search-and-rescue crews also looked and Tur flew through driving rain in his search. They initially were unable to find the elder Ridgeway among Easter weekend crowds of campers. It was like looking for `` a needle in a sand dune,'' Tur said. `` It was a pretty close call, mainly because the helicopter was running out of fuel,'' the younger <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON> said. `` They -LRB- Tur and others with him -RRB- had 10 minutes left before they would have had to turn around and go back.'' <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON> required the transplant because he suffered polycystic kidney failure, in which cysts form in the kidney and prevent its proper functioning, <PERSON> Ayala </PERSON> said. The condition is genetic, <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON> said. He said the donated kidney came from a local teen-age girl. <PERSON> Ayala </PERSON> said she had no details on the donor.

<HEAD>Sources: Iran Plans To Releas Yacht Seized By Guards</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> planned to release a yacht that was seized by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Revolutionary Guards with four Britons and members of the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> royal family on board, sources said Monday. Details of the incident remained sketchy in the face of government denials, and sources could not confirm whether the yacht and its passengers were still in Iranian hands. But Iranian diplomats in the southern gulf port of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> were discreetly spreading word that the yacht would not be held, said a diplomatic source in <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> who spoke on condition of anonymity. Earlier reports said the ship was seized Thursday near the Revolutionary Guard stronghold of <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, with five members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s ruling <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> family and four young British women on board. One report said they were airline stewardesses. There was no confirmation Monday of who was on board. `` This seems to be nothing more than the usual practice of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards,'' said a Kuwait-based diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` There does not appear to be anything political behind this incident, it just seems to be an exercise in piracy.'' The guards, using speedboats with guns mounted on board, roamed the gulf shipping lanes and attacked vessels during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, which was halted in August by a cease-fire. `` A ranking Iranian diplomat has confirmed that the yacht was seized when it strayed in Iranian waters,'' said the diplomatic source in <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>. He also said the Iranian confirmed an imminent release. The sources said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> did not want to jeopardize the friendly ties it has been developing with <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> since the cease-fire, and that the affair would end quietly. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has not commented publicly on the reports. The diplomats said the occupants of the yacht may have been released by Monday, but that sandstorms and rough seas were keeping the ship in Iranian waters. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s government apparently leaked the story to the respected daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION> to pressure <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for a release. The newspaper first reported details of the seizure on Sunday. The governments of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> denied all reports involving the incident. The diplomats speculated that the identity of the passengers would never be released, especially if members of the royal family were involved. The 82-foot yacht's name, the <LOCATION> Falaika </LOCATION>, is the same as a resort island off <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and indicated that it came from the wealthy emirate. If Britons were on board, they might not have been missed because they did not bother to register with the local embassy, the diplomats said. `` By the time everything has firmed up, it will probably be referred to as a case of a small motorboat getting lost and released, with no one of significance aboard,'' said one source.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last year turned away or deported 17,854 foreigners for carrying fake passports or working illegally, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> report Monday. For the first time in 10 years, the number of males deported for violating immigration law exceeded that of females and was 90 percent higher than in 1987, the report said.

Of the total, more than 16,000 foreigners overstayed visas and 14,300 of these were employed without proper working papers, the report said. The remaining foreigners were turned away at borders with fake papers, the report said. The largest national group deported was from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, followed by illegal workers from <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the report said.

<HEAD>Detainee Halts Hunger Strike After 38 Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DURBAN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A detained black activist ended a 38-day hunger strike Monday, drinking milk and eating two slices of toast to end the longest of a wave of fasts protesting detention without trial. <PERSON> Sandile </PERSON> <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON> said he would consider resuming the hunger strike if Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> refused to free him. `` I'm just giving Mr. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> a chance, a few days so he can think about my release,'' <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON>, 26, said from his bed at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aidan </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, where he was visited by his mother, aunt and sister-in-law <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON> lost about 57 pounds, one-third of his normal weight, in the hunger strike, and doctors had said he risked brain damage and blindness if he did not resume eating immediately. He was fasting to protest his nine-month detention without trial. The Law and <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said last week that <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON>'s release would not be considered while he continued his fast. There has been no response from the ministry to his decision to resume eating. <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON> said he would suspend the fast after a meeting Saturday with the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, a prominent anti-apartheid leader. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> also spoke Saturday to <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> about <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON>, who has staged the longest fast of the estimated 600 detainees participating in hunger strikes since January to demand their freedom. <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON>, a university researcheundations and contributions from 100,000 members, has 40 staff lawyers. `` I guess we would have more than effective legal counsel in any litigation,'' said <PERSON> Meyerhoff </PERSON>, who is a lawyer. `` Unless there was some showing of bad faith or malice here on our part, the law is clear that a lawsuit like that could be successfully defended,'' he said, adding such a lawsuit could be considered frivolous by the courts. The <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> report on pesticide residues in childrens' food was released in late February, and concluded that eating apples treated with the growth regulator Alar increased cancer risk in children. The report has been widely disputed, and the federal government has said apples are safe to eat. The industry has accused the <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> of unfairness because only 5 percent of the crop is treated with Alar. Alar is the trade name for daminozide, and is still legal to use. Nevertheless, the report caused an uproar, prompting some school districts to temporarily ban apples, hurting exports and retail sales. The exact economic impact has not yet been measured, but prices for the top grade of red apples have dropped about $ 2 per box in recent weeks, and apple shipments from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> dropped by over 300,000 boxes in the past two weeks. Warehouses in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which produces half the nation's supermarket apples, still have 17.7 million boxes of red apples from the fall harvest in storage Multiplying that by $ 2 per 42-pound box produces an economic loss of $ 35.4 million for the rest of the season, even if prices drop no further. `` The basic problem in the industry now is they've -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- smeared the red apple so bad on the Alar thing that it's rolling over into the non-Alar-treated fruit,'' <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> said. `` Everytime a housewife sees red apples she could be seeing red herself,'' he said. `` I do n't know how you can measure that.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it had made a final determination that imports of anti-friction bearings from nine countries are being sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at less than fair value. The department's ruling covered imports from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>. The agency also ruled that bearings from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> were being subsidized. As a result of earlier preliminary rulings in the case, cash deposits or bonds are being imposed on imports from the nine countries to offset the price advantages and subsidies. If the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> makes a final ruling that the low-priced imports harm <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will instruct the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to collect the final anti-dumping and countervailing duties. The department began its investigation after the <ORGANIZATION> Torrington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Torrington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, filed a petition last March on behalf of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bearing industry, alleging that massive dumping by the foreign countries was damaging the domestic bearing industry. <LOCATION> Torrington </LOCATION> is the nation's largest producer of a range of bearings. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gridley </PERSON>, the company's industry marketing manager, said several studies had found that a `` substantial number of bearing factories closed and workers were laid off while at the same time imports from these foreign countries have been increasing.'' <PERSON> Gridley </PERSON> said the company was very pleased with the ruling and with the department's in-depth inquiry. The petition resulted in 34 anti-dumping and 10 countervailing duty investigations covering several kinds of bearings. The department said the investigations were the most technical and complex in several years, and covered more than 25 foreign companies. Imports of anti-friction bearings from the nine countries were estimated at about $ 650 million in 1988. Anti-friction bearings are used in the aircraft, automotive, machinery and electronics industries.

Some <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> supporters want an independent <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, but the organization has stopped short of calling for secession. `` Any question of secession is for the future'' while the republic works toward creating democratic institutions, <PERSON> Chapaitis </PERSON> said in an interview.

 Christian army gunners exchanged artillery fire with Druse militiamen and Syrian soldiers Monday in a battle that began nearly three weeks ago and has killed or wounded hundreds of civilians. An Arab League mediation committee appealed for a cease-fire. Police reported sporadic rocket and howitzer barrages during the day and said the fire intensified just before sundown. They said the Syrians and <PERSON> Druse </PERSON> launched hundreds of rockets into into residential districts of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the Christian enclave north and east of the capital. Dozens of rockets were directed at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Yarze </LOCATION>, headquarters of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who commands the 20,000 Christians of the Lebanese army, and the presidential palace in nearby <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> lives. His gunners used 155mm howitzers to shell Syrian and Druse positions in the mountains overlooking <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, police said. They reported two civilians were killed and seven wounded in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and four wounded in Druse-controlled villages southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, but they had no word on casualties among combatants.

Citizens on both sides of the sectarian line that divides <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, who have been living in bomb shelters, took advantage of the comparative daytime lull to replenish food and other necessities. `` It seems our hibernation ... is going to last for a long time,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Khoury </PERSON>, a Christian from the <LOCATION> Mansourieh </LOCATION> district. `` I have bought some mattresses because we can not go on sleeping on the hard floor, some games for the children and tranquilizers for our fraying nerves.'' Random shelling overnight sometimes reached 60 rounds a minute and the main power plant was set ablaze. Electricity was rationed to four hours Monday. Arab League mediators sent appeals for a truce from league headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> to President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the Lebanese belligerents, <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> radio stations reported. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> keeps 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and has become the country's main power broker during the long civil war. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, leads the six-member committee. The mediators, appointed in January, scheduled meetings in the Tunisian capital with two former presidents of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and four of its former premiers. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> told a news conference Monday he had sent a new note to the league blaming the fighting on <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s `` lust for power.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has made no secret of his hopes to become president. President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> named <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to lead an interim government Sept. 22, when <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> could not agree on a successor at the end of <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s six-year term. Moslems supported by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> swore allegiance to <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, the incumbent Sunni Moslem premier, and two governments resulted. Under an unwritten agreement dating to independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943, the president is a Christian, the premier a Sunni and the parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> says the Syrians have become an occupation force by taking sides, and has declared a `` war of liberation'' to drive them out. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> contends the Syrian military presence is legitimate. `` The Syrian army entered <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1976 at the request of the ... Lebanese government,'' he told reporters. `` This request was later endorsed by the Arab League, of which <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is a founding member.'' Any demand for Syrian withdrawal should come from a united government, `` which is not present at the moment,'' he said, and accused <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> of `` pushing <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to the brink of ... disaster.''

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> will propose elections in the occupied lands as a step toward beginning peace talks with Palestinians while avoiding direct contact with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, a senior official said Monday. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who is bringing his peace plan to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next week, is being pressed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, European countries and opponents in his own government to find a way to end the Palestinian uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Also Monday, an Israeli policeman caught alone in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village opened fire Monday on young Arabs who pelted him with stones, killing a 4-year-old boy, the army reported. Arab hospital officials said <PERSON> Amjad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> died of a chest wound. The death toll since the uprising began in the occupied territories more than 15 months ago now stands at 412 Palestinians and 18 Israelis. A military spokesman said the policeman who came under stone-throwing attack in <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kad </LOCATION>, a remote <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village, and `` was forced to use his weapon.'' He did not say why the policeman was there. Israeli policemen are assigned to the occupied territories only for investigative duties and the army handles patrols. The military command said police and the army were investigating the shooting. The senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan calls for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied lands to choose local leaders in the next few months who can negotiate an interim peace agreement. But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said his proposal would not lead to an independent Palestinian state. `` In the Land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> there can be just one country, the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said Monday at a gathering of senior members of his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. `` In the coming days, I'm going on a mission for the country. I'm confident because I know the majority of the country is behind me,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said of his trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The official said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s vision of the temporary settlement resembles the five-year period of Palestinian autonomy outlined in the U.S.-sponsored Camp David accords that led to the 1979 peace treaty with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. `` The main idea is elections as part of an interim settlement, but the type and extent of the elections _ whether they would be mayors or local leaders or representatives _ will be left open to negotiation,'' the official said. Other reports have said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> might propose administering the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> with neighboring <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> as part of a confederation. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, who proposed several months ago that elections be held, told high school pupils near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> on Monday his center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc must cooperate on a peace plan. `` We can of course <PERSON> gore </PERSON> each other, the two main blocs ... but let's put aside differences and seek the area where we can move the peace process forward in a joint, cooperative way among us,'' he said. Labor, led by Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> formed a `` national unity'' coalition after indecisive elections in November. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> refuses contact with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which he says is a terrorist group, and objected when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opened contacts after <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism in December. Holding elections, which <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> initially rejected, is seen here as a compromise. `` I am convinced that in any peace agreement both sides have to overcome many obstacles and also make concessions,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said Sunday on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television Sunday. According to the senior official, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is trying to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to accept the proposal for Palestinians not officially linked to it to open talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> insists on entering the talks later. He said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s government rejects that condition as well as demands that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> accept the principle of trading land for peace. Meanwhile, leaders of the rebellion urged <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to intensify it with `` knives, axes, firebombs and large rocks.'' In leaflet No. 37, issued Monday, the Unified National Leadership of the Uprising also demanded that Palestinians boycott meetings with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials to frustrate <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s effort to find non-PLO partners for peace talks. A general strike Monday virtually shut the territories down. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said 11 Palestinians suffered gunshot wounds in six stone-throwing encounters with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. Soldiers confined more than 260,000 <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> residents to their homes with curfews on eight towns and refugee camps.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will name a veteran national security official to an arms control post that became a focus of controversy in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, the White House announced Monday.

 <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, jailed for more than 12 years for a murder he says he did n't commit and freed partly because of the movie `` Thin Blue Line,'' said Monday he hopes to build a future by speaking about his ordeal. `` This is a case and a story that must be held before the public,'' <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said in an inteview at his mother's home `` I want to get some speaking engagements, talk to people, law schools, places where lawyers and judges are trained. They must know my story. `` If I can support myself and do that, I want to take that avenue. But failing that, I'll get a job. In that case, <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> could just filter into the mists of time.'' In the meantime, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a quiet, introspective man with a dry wit, is enjoying his newfound freedom and trying to find some private time. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, 40, was freed last week from a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> prison he had inhabited since being convicted in 1977 for the murder of a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> policeman. He was sentenced to die. He was released Tuesday after the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reversed the conviction. On Thursday, prosecutors announced they would not seek to retry him. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' story was chronicled in filmmaker <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' documentary `` Thin Blue Line,'' which questioned evidence and prompted <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> officials to re-examine the case <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> spent Thursday night with his mother, <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON>, who sold her house in suburban <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to help pay her son's legal bills. After taking a short drive Friday around <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, which has doubled in size since he last saw it, he spent the rest of the day with his family in <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He spent most of Saturday and part of Easter Sunday shopping for clothes and other necessities. On Sunday morning, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> attended an Easter church service. `` <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> took a flower out of his lapel and gave it to the pastor,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. Then the whole church clapped. That whole church was just so glad to see that boy.'' He tried to rent a videotape of `` Thin Blue Line,'' but was told it was not in stock. `` The guy there said I should n't rent it because all they do in it is talk,'' he said, smiling. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> had other errands to run Monday, including applying for a driver's license and a Social Security number. He also went to rent a post office box to accommodate the stream of letters and gifts for him. `` I've been given just about everything you can think of, an Easter bunny, flowers, this watch,'' he said. But <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was calm in the face of the publicity storm his release created. He said the family has agreed to put its private homecoming on hold for now. `` We're trying to snatch as much private time as possible. My family understands,'' he said, adding that his mother has become almost as much a celebrity as he has. `` I'm afraid I'm going to have to get her an agent.'' He said he tries not to think about the time he spent in prison, which he said `` is as bad and worse than any movie you've ever seen. I carry the scars.'' His face filled with pain and he spoke slowly when he recalled his brush with death in 1980. Three days before his execution date, a stay was issued. `` A judge calls you in and tells you you have 30 days, then you return to your cell and you have 29 days, and then you have 20 days and then you have 10 days ... and you know next week, you may have nothing,'' he said. `` You make peace with yourself. `` You must know the man that is inside you. I liked the man I saw there. But I wonder if I could have been man enough to ... walk to my death as a man.''

 King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> arrived Monday for meetings with President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> in the quest by moderate <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> for a common position on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> is scheduled to meet with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next Monday. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> will confer with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> three days later, and King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> is to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on May 2. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, conferred with <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> on Saturday to coordinate strategy in seeking an energetic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> said Monday he told a group of visiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators: `` It is vital that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> play its role in helping to achieve permanent and comprehensive peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit is aimed at pushing the peace effort forward.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, Fahd and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> favor an international conference on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace, which Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has opposed. It would include the parties involved and the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Egyptian officials said privately that <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and the others believe the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can convince <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to reverse its position on such a forum and its refusal to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and hope the conference can begin this year. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is considered a key because of its political influence in the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> world </LOCATION>, friendship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, financial aid to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and poorer <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states, and position as custodian of Islam's holiest shrines. The 10th anniversary the U.S.-mediated peace treaty between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occurred Sunday. No other Arab country has made peace with the Jewish state. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is involved in current peace efforts in hopes of acting as `` a bridge'' and `` because the parties want us there,'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> has said. Fahd's four-day official visit is the first by a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> monarch to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 15 years. The Egyptian officials said the meetings with <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> should strengthen <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s hand with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. After the <LOCATION> Ismailiya </LOCATION> discussions, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renewed the demand for an international peace conference and praised the current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace as `` positive.'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said: `` We believe the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is giving great attention to this problem and we hope the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> position will crystallize very soon. ... We all hope to see progress toward comprehensive peace in the region and we believe the international conference is the only means to this end.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> renewed his promise of action twice last week. In an interview published Friday, he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> he planned to tell <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> `` we have got to move the peace process forward.'' In a White House statement released Saturday, he said the 10th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Egyptian-Israeli </LOCATION> treaty `` turns our minds toward the still more daunting challenges ahead. ... We must commit ourselves, as <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> did, to fresh thinking.'' President <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, then <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s prime minister, negotiated the treaty. <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> was assassinated in 1981.

 Opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> said Monday that ultrarightists in the government and military oppose democratic reforms and are `` attempting to bring about a catstrophe by any means.'' They fear losing their hold on power and `` feel as if their throats are being choked by demcoratic reforms,'' he said in an address to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> also said he is opposed to a referendum on President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s administration and that he favors the presence of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> until peace can be secured with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. In other developments: _ Police detained 23 dissidents who tried to reach the North Korean border for a reunification meeting with communist delegates at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, the truce site established in the demilitarized zone under the cease-fire that ended the Korean War in 1953 The dissidents had defied a government order barring South Koreans from going to the meeting. _ Government prosecutors said that a dissident leader, the Rev. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ik-hwan </PERSON>, would be arrested if he returns to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> from an unauthorized visit to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> They said <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> would face prosecution under national security laws and if convicted could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> arrived Saturday in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> capital, after a trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. South Korean officials denounced <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> for a speech he made in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> in which he called North Korean leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> a `` respectable president.'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> announced on March 20 that he was indefinitely postponing the planned midterm referendum on his government's performance, but <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> urged the president not to hold such an election. He said a referendum could plunge the nation into chaos and allow extreme rightists to seize control. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has said he postponed the referendum because radical leftists were plotting a revolution. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, said it would be premature to conduct a refereundum because <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has not carried out all of the democratic reforms he promised during the election campaign. `` Our goal is not to expel him -LRB- <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> -RRB-, but to complete work for true democracy,'' he added. Some observers believe <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> does not want a referendum because polls show he is trailing rival opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON>. They said if the people voted against <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s administration it could have forced an election and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> had the best chance of winning. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general, won the election in December 1987 after <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> split the opposition vote. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> rejected the anti-Americanism of many radical groups that are demanding the withdrawal of the 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. He said he favored Amerian troops remaining here until a permanent peace with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is assured.

<HEAD>Fishermen Say `I Told You So' After Huge Oil Spill</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Tanker Spill, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fishermen who warned years ago that an oil spill could wreak havoc with Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>'s pristine environment say their worst fears have been realized. `` It's a heck of a way to win an argument,'' said fisherman <PERSON> Knute </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 62, who opposed the 1977 construction of an oil terminal in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, the nation's northernmost ice-free port. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> joined a group of fishermen who testified in the 1970s before a congressional committee considering construction of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline and the oil terminal. `` We were concerned about what biological damages could be,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said Monday. `` We were concerned about tankers piling up on reefs.'' The oil companies `` ignored us,'' he said. `` All they said was that the latest technology would be used. They said not to worry about a spill because it would never happen. Now it's happened.'' The tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground early Friday on a charted reef as it maneuvered around floating ice 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. Cleanup of the 10.1 million-gallon spill, the largest in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, was proceeding slowly Monday as high winds and currents spread the oil over more than 100 square miles. A $ 12 million herring-roe fishery expected to open in early April may be ruined, while other fisheries may suffer this summer and for years to come, said <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, executive director for the <ORGANIZATION> Cordova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishermen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>. Some fishermen could go broke waiting for other fisheries to open, she said. Last year, fishermen on Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> caught $ 131 million in salmon, herring, halibut and shellfish. Even if this year's catch is good, marketing the fish could be difficult, said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesarini </PERSON>, co-owner of a Valdez fish-processing company. `` People are concerned whether the fish will be edible,'' she said. Charter boat operations and other businesses dependent on tourism say the spill is tarnishing the pristine image of the island-dotted sound, which is surrounded by glacier-topped mountains and filled with whales, bald eagles, porpoises and other wildlife. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said one of the hardest-hit towns may be <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON>, 30 miles east of the spill. The town's population swells to 6,000 residents during fishing season. `` Everybody is here because of fishing in <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said. `` We can be looking at a devastating loss.'' Up to 50 fishermen offered their boats for the messy job of pulling containment booms around fingers of the oil spill, but by Monday only four boats had been used. <PERSON> Cesarini </PERSON> said she already is losing money because of the spill. A boat en route to the cannery with 14,000 pounds of scallops had to be diverted because the spill closed the Port of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. `` We're talking about $ 1 million lost income right this second,'' with more losses likely to follow, she said. `` We're pretty outraged This was to have been our best year.'' Fishermen met Sunday with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials to discuss claims for compensation for immediate losses as well as losses expected from damage to the marine environment during the next 20 years. The company said it will operate claims offices in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cordvoa </LOCATION>. The spill may affect dozens of charter boats, cruise ships and state-run ferries that cater to the summer tourist trade. In <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, population 3,100, motels and restaurants are packed now with oil spill workers, government officials and journalists, but the boom soon may give way to a bust. `` I would n't expect people in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> will want to see beautfiful Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> with oil floating in it,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said. `` It's a negative we'll probably live with all summer long,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glacier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tours </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, which coordinates cruises in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. `` Any time something negative happens, that's what people remember. They do n't remember that it's cleaned up.'' -- -

 Thousands of ethnic Albanians clashed with police throughout <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> on Monday in the province's worst ethnic violence in eight years Two police officers were reported killed and at least eight people wounded. State-run media said violence spread to at least seven <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> towns in the fifth straight day of protests of constitutional changes that would reduce autonomy in the southern province. Helicopters sprayed tear gas on demonstrators in one town, the <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said, and gunfire was reported in at least three others. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said officials closed schools and universities and banned gatherings of more than three people. Authorities also imposed an 8 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew on the province, permitting only movement authorized by police, the news agency said. Barrages of handgun and automatic weapon fire rang out Monday afternoon in the suburbs of <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, the provincial capital, 160 miles south of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. State-run media said a paramilitary officer was shot and killed in clashes with thousands of Albanians in <LOCATION> Podujevo </LOCATION>, 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>. Another police officer was fatally shot in the town of <LOCATION> Titova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mitrovica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> radio said. In addition, unconfirmed reports said two demonstrators were killed in <LOCATION> Podujevo </LOCATION>. State-run media reported only eight injuries by early evening, but witnesses and media reports suggested many more had been wounded in the violence. Two <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporters traveling through <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> on Monday saw hundreds of military vehicles, including modern Soviet-made T-72 tanks, on the move. Helmeted riot police carrying shields and wearing gas masks used tear gas, batons, water cannon and even armored personnel carriers to disperse thousands of ethnic Albanians. Police road blocks ringed <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> and at least one other town, <LOCATION> Lipljan </LOCATION>, was reported temporarily sealed off by police during a fierce battle with demonstrators hurling rocks and bottles. There were similar battles in <LOCATION> Gnjilane </LOCATION>, according to television reports. By evening, there was no visible military presence in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s governing body, the collective presidency, said Monday's demonstrations `` were characterized by unprecedented brutality and aggressiveness,'' the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported. The protests were the worst since 1981, when at least nine people died in ethnic riots in the province. The protests began Thursday, when <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> approved constitutional amendments giving leaders from the mainly Christian republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> more power in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> is the largest of the country's six republics. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s provinces of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> have enjoyed considerable autonomy since 1974, but Serbian leaders said they needed more control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> to protect the mainly Christian Serbian minority from the mainly Moslem ethnic Albanian majority, which makes up 85 percent of the vote. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that 174 ethnic Albanians have been detained in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> since Thursday. Seventy-eight of them have been sentenced to between 30 and 60 days in jail on misdemeanor charges, the agency said. More than 100 other ethnic Albanians were sentenced to 60 days in jail Monday for defying compulsory orders to work and end protest strikes at two <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> mines, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. A partial state of emergency was imposed on the province last month because of the strikes. The ethnic unrest in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> has deepened divisions in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s Communist leadership, with leaders in the more liberal northern republics of <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> opposing <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s drive for more control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Borba </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that an unsigned appeal to the human rights organization <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> was published in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> protesting the arrests of ethnic Albanians. Among those detained is <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> party leader in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, who is accused of fomenting strikes by ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> workers last month. He is the first party man detained on political grounds in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> since the 1950s. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s poorest region, with 30 percent unemployment, twice the national average. Ethnic tension throughout the country has been exacerbated by the long political and economic crisis, with annual inflation expected to hit 400 percent in April.

 The government released contradictory findings in the 1984 assassination of Premier <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> Monday, one implicating her personal secretary and expressing the suspicion that he was linked to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. A memorandum accompanying this report exonerated the secretary, said Home Minister <PERSON> Buta </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> in releasing the report to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> disclosed at the same time that separate investigations that did not figure in the report `` unraveled a conspiracy, a larger conspiracy to eliminate Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>,'' and that more arrests were expected shortly Two Sikh bodyguards shot and killed Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> on Oct. 31, 1984, as she walked through the garden of her <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> residence to a television interview. Her son, <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON>, replaced her as prime minister. A report by an investigative commission under <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> M.P. <PERSON> Thakkar </PERSON> was completed nearly three years ago, but was kept secret on national security grounds. This inquiry ran parallel to an inquiry of police experts called the Special Investigating Team. The 314-page Thakkar report implicated <PERSON> Rajendra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s secretary for more than 20 years, and also said security officials were aware of the threat to Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s life and could have prevented the murder. A memorandum accompanying the report said the allegations were checked out by the Special Investigating Team, appointed by the government to lay charges against those involved, and it found <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON> had `` no hand in the conspiracy.'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> the team completed its work in January and added that charges will be filed soon against others involved in the conspiracy. The Thakkar report links only three people directly to the assassination: the two known gunmen and <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON>, 52, left government after the assassination, but returned last month as an adviser to <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON> could not be reached at his home or office for comment, but the government has said he is innocent. According to the Thakkar report, Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> reprimanded <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON> a month before her death and made inquiries about replacing him. It accused <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON> of facilitating the murder by countermanding an order to remove all Sikhs from the inner security circle, approving shift changes for one assassin, and keeping secret instructions about Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s security that indicated `` he was snooping or spying on the late prime minister and was active as an informant for someone.'' The report said <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON> was walking with Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> to the interview, but fell back just before the shooting started. `` It appears that he has been making a deliberate effort to emphasize that he had not noticed <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> taking out his revolver from his hip pocket,'' the report said. It said <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON> lied or gave inadequate reponses to questions about entries in his diary about one assassin, foreign money, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and his association with a Sikh suspected of having ties to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agency, which `` gives rise to a suspicion as to whether <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON> had some links with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>.'' The Thakkar report said security officials `` appear to have taken things for granted.'' It said `` high officials ... were aware of the threat to the life of the prime minister'' and that `` the unfortunate occurrence could have been averted'' through careful study and precautionary action. <PERSON> Thakkar </PERSON> finished his report in February 1986, but recommended it be kept secret lest its contents jeopardize other investigations. Only <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and two senior <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers had seen the report when <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution in July 1986 allowing it to be withheld. Two weeks ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> newspaper published excerpts and oppostion lawmakers demanded the report be released. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> made it public after some members of his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said they would do it if he did not. The government says Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was killed in revenge for an army raid she ordered in June 1984 on <LOCATION> Sikhdom </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, to clear the compound of militants. At least 1,200 people died, most of them Sikhs. Other bodyguards shot and killed one assassin, <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, and the other, <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, was convicted of murder and hanged on Jan. 6. A third Sikh, <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, was convicted of conspiracy and hanged. The three men were not related. All male Sikhs take the name <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, which means lion.

<TEXT>
 A bomb exploded near a British cultural center early Tuesday, hours after Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> arrived to discuss the controversy over the novel `` The Satanic Verses.'' Police said no one was injured in the 1 a.m. blast at a building under construction about 10 yards from the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>. It broke windows in the library and some surrounding shops, but damage appeared to be slight. Bomb experts at the scene had no immediate information on the explosives used. There were no claims of responsibility, but the bombing appeared to be linked to anti-British protests over `` The Satanic Verses,'' by <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, a naturalized British subject born in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. An explosion at a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s largest city, killed a <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> guard on Feb. 27 Police said they believed the blast was related to <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book. Moslems feel the novel blasphemes Islam. The book includes a brothel scene in which the prostitutes take the names of wives of the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, and it suggests <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> wrote the holy Koran rather than receiving it directly from Allah. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> has been in hiding in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since Feb. 14, when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomenie </PERSON> ordered Moslems kill the author <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, who was born a Moslem but no longer practices religion, has defended his work as a fictional examination of the nature of good and evil. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Monday afternoon amid unprecedented security designed to prevent protests over the book. About 2,000 police lined the 12-mile route from <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to the British Embassy. Authorities barred would-be protesters from demonstrating at the embassy. `` If our government would have allowed the demonstration, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> would have felt the depth of our feeling,'' said <PERSON> Mustaza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pooya </PERSON>, a member of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pooya </PERSON> was among a delegation of fundamentalist religious leaders and right-wing Pakistani politicians that was allowed to present a four-page memorandum to the foreign secretary criticizing <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for protecting <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> was `` willing to concede that the book certainly caused anguish,'' <PERSON> Pooya </PERSON> said after the meeting. Reporters were barred. Authorities imposed a ban on public gatherings in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> of more than five people during <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>'s 26-hour visit. Seven people died and more than 100 were injured in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> on Feb. 12 when hundreds of demonstrators battled police outside an American cultural center to protest publicatin of `` The Satanic Verses'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, a Moslem country of 107 million people, banned `` The Satanic Verses'' after its publication in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> last September. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> was to meet with Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> to discuss the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> crisis, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and both countries' support of Moslem rebels battling the communist government in neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was urged Monday to find a national consensus `` against executing our young'' and ban the death penalty for all juvenile murderers. `` There is a consensus of opinion in this country against executing our young,'' argued attorney <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> McKerrow </PERSON> in behalf of a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> death row inmate condemned for a murder he committed when he was 16. But questions from the bench during two hours of arguments in cases from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> suggested the justices doubt that any clear consensus exists. The high court is to decide by July whether imposing the death penalty on murderers who committed their crimes before reaching the age of 18 represents the `` cruel and unusual punishment'' banned by the Constitution's Eighth Amendment. In the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> was condemned for a murder he committed when he was 16. In the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanford </PERSON> was sentenced to death for a killing he committed when he was 17. The court's decision will affect only 31 of the more than 2,200 death row inmates nationwide. Anti-capital punishment forces nevertheless are attaching enormous importance to the issue. The justices were told that of the 36 states with capital punishment laws, only 12 ban the death penalty for killers who were under 18 when they committed their crimes. Noting the lack of unanimity among state legislatures, Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> asked, `` Why should we set the bright line at 18?'' Ms. <PERSON> McKerrow </PERSON>, a lawyer from <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, answered that 18 `` is the age most commonly chosen for demarking the separation between childhood and adulthood.'' She noted that 80 Missouri laws treat individuals under 18 differently from those over 18 _ including a law that bars juveniles from witnessing executions. Ms. <PERSON> McKerrow </PERSON> also noted that the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judges </ORGANIZATION> have supported banning capital punishment for juvenile killers. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Heft </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> lawyer, argued for <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> that people under 18 are `` children who have not evolved into adults'' and who `` have a tremendous capacity for change.'' The issue is not whether a line should be drawn but where to draw the line,'' Heft contended. Lawyers for <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> urged the justices to leave any line-drawing to state legislatures. `` What is a national consensus?'' asked Missouri Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. He said the fact that <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, the convicted <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> killer, could have been condemned in 22 states despite his age `` demonstrates an absence of a national consensus'' regarding a minimum age for executions. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> did not explain the apparent conflict between his use of the 22-state figure and the fact that 24 of the 36 states with death penalty laws do not exempt those under 18. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said state legislatures may choose to exempt juveniles from the death penalty as a matter of mercy, but argued, `` The Constitution is an instrument of justice, not an instrument of mercy.'' He added, `` Common sense dictates that youths mature at different rates.'' The high court effectively drew the allowable capital-punishment line at age 16 last year when it voted 5-3 to throw out the death penalty of an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> killer who committed his crime when he was 15. Four members of the court _ Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> _ said in that decision that the death penalty is unconstitutional for those younger than 16. Three _ <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> _ said that the Constitution does not set such age limits. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who asked only two neutral questions Monday, provided a fifth vote last year but stopped short of calling for the abolition of capital punishment for killers under 16. She will provide a key vote in the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> cases. So, too, will Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who joined the court in February 1988, too late to participate in the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> case. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> asked numerous questions Monday, some of which focused on a jury's ability to take a defendant's youth into account even if the death penalty is a possibility. The cases are <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, 87-6026, and Heft vs. <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>, 87-5765.

The broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted a statement by the Culture and <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s film division as saying, `` The showing of this film, especially in a Moslem country, is an insult to ... all those who believe in God, and is playing into the hands of global arrogance -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB-, which fears the role of religion in awakening the oppressed countries.'' The film by American director <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> was adapted from a novel. Many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and West European Christians condemned it for a dream sequence in which <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> descends from the cross, seduces <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON> and raises a family.

 The chairman of the presidential commission that investigated the Three Mile Island accident said Monday that the nuclear power industry apparently has heeded the panel's recommendations and become more safety conscious `` We warned them that unless they changed their attitude completely they would be out of business, and it sounds to me as if they took it to heart,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemeny </PERSON> said on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the nation's worst atomic power accident. <PERSON> Kemeny </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> president, based his assessment on a recent report by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION>, a group the industry established after <ORGANIZATION> Three </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> to work on safety issues. The institute concluded that the nation's 111 nuclear power plants now licensed are safer and more efficient. `` I'm not saying that every problem has been fixed,'' <PERSON> Kemeny </PERSON> said in an interview. But he said it was `` very hard for me to believe that it's the same industry we really tore apart 10 years ago.'' Still, <PERSON> Kemeny </PERSON> said he was concerned that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission may have become even more mired in a maze of regulations that do n't necessarily insure safety. Referring to reports that the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> mandated 149 changes based on his commission's recommendations, <PERSON> Kemeny </PERSON> said: `` That's typical madness to me. I wish they had mandated 40 important -LRB- changes -RRB-. They'd have a much better chance of compliance.'' <PERSON> Kemeny </PERSON>, 62, is a mathematician who had a small role in the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project that developed the first atomic bomb during World War II, and who later worked as a research assistant to <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Kemeny </PERSON> to head a 12-member commission to investigate the Three Mile Island accident. The panel spent six months investigating the March 28, 1979, partial meltdown at the nuclear power plant in <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. Among its recommendations that the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> adopted were establishing 10-mile evacuation-planning zones around commercial reactors and requiring an array of new control-room equipment to better apprise operators of a plant's safety status. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., charged during the weekend that nearly four out of five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> atomic plants still have failed to complete all the changes <PERSON> Kemeny </PERSON> did not dispute <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>'s allegations, but reached a different conclusion, noting an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> official's statement that more than 97 percent of the changes have been completed. `` Remember, these are all changes, none of which were in place 10 years ago,'' <PERSON> Kemeny </PERSON> said. `` I think that's substantial change.'' Ten years ago <PERSON> Kemeny </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> `` the worst government agency that existed.'' He said he still has concerns. `` What we found -LRB- then -RRB- was that they had such a huge number of regulations _ they regulated everything, even minute things _ that many -LRB- nuclear plant officials -RRB- ... spent all their time making sure that they met all the regulations, rather than worrying whether their plant was safe,'' <PERSON> Kemeny </PERSON> said. `` I do n't mean that those two things are inconsistent, but just because you meet all the paper regulations does not mean your plant is safe.'' <PERSON> Kemeny </PERSON> said he has n't followed the commission closely in recent years, but noted that the private <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> duplicates much of the information sharing, inspection and training that the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> does, sometimes with stricter standards. `` To me that's a suggestion that the industry itself feels that the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> is not sufficient,'' <PERSON> Kemeny </PERSON> said. `` Let me say one thing for the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>,'' he added. `` I do n't think regulation alone can solve this problem. Unless the industry has a commitment to safety, no amount of regulation can solve it.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> urged the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to reconsider a proposed aid package to the Nicaraguan rebels, saying the guerrillas were `` a cannon aimed at <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, speaking to 60 <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> scholars from 37 countries, accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of ignoring a Central American peace plan that commits regional leaders to drafting a program by mid-May to dismantle the rebel force. He said of the bipartisan aid package unveiled Friday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, `` It reaffirms once again the policy that the strongest can act without regard for the will of others.'' The proposal, worked out between the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and congressional leaders, provides $ 4.5 million a month in non-military aid to the rebels, known as Contras. The current $ 27.1 million in humanitarian aid runs out Friday. The package proposes aid at least through November and could continue through Feb. 28, 1990, if congressional committees approve. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were respectful of our accord, it would approve aid for 90 days, and gear it to the dismantling of the Contras,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told the gathering of <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fellowship </ORGANIZATION> scholars, in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on a one-day visit. `` What they're trying to do is maintain intact a force in Honduran territory, which is like a cannon aimed at <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The president of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> himself has insisted he has not agreed that the Contras remain for another 10 months or a year.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` still has time to rectify, and show its respect for the will of the Central American presidents.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> moved up general elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> by 10 months to Feb. 25, 1990, as part of the regional peace plan he and the presidents of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> reached in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Feb. 14. The presidents agreed to come up with a plan by mid-May to demobilize up to 11,000 Contras living in Honduran jungle camps near <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> with about 12,000 relatives. Most guerrillas moved from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> into the camps after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off military aid in February 1988. A month later, the Contras and <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> signed a cease-fire, which <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has been extending every month since. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> might consider redirecting the proposed $ 45 million in aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, which could use the money to build 9,000 homes for victims of last October's Hurricane <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>. He said with $ 45 million, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> could buy food to feed 750,000 people for seven months, or milk for 2.8 million children. `` That indeed would be humanitarian aid,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. `` We hope this is a document with a rhetorical tint ... and that deep inside it really is looking for a peaceful solution. But their actions will be the determinant'' factor. Responding to questions, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he finds it inconceivable that the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> could lose next year's elections. `` The people would have to be crazy to vote against the Front... against the revolution,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said `` The peasant, the worker who has seen his wife, his son killed by the Contras is not going to vote against the Front.'' He said Nicaraguans have `` discovered the ... capacity of capitalism to exploit them, to keep them in ignorance, the capacity to deny them the right to organize. ... Now, the day the people do n't want any more revolution, they have the vote and the weapons in their hands. The people decide. The Front can not impose anything on the people.'' Barricada, the official <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> paper, and the pro-government <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid package is proof the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> won <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s eight-year civil war. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Makes Official <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Triumph,'' said <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuevo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diario </PERSON>'s headline. <PERSON> Erick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Social-Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid proposal sounded the rebels' death knell. It `` effectively foresees the end of the war,'' he said in an interview. `` The war has no future and I believe the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must channel its efforts in that direction.''

 Leftist guerrillas released an empty railroad car parked at a siding Monday, and the car killed three people as it rumbled down the tracks for nine miles before coming to a halt, officials reported. <ORGANIZATION> Enafer </ORGANIZATION>, the state railroad company, said the car was set loose near <LOCATION> Chosica </LOCATION>, 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. It blamed left-wing rebels but did not name a specific group. The brief statement did not identify the three people who were killed or give any other details. Officials reported two policemen were slain by gunmen of the Maoist Shining Path movement in separate attacks. They said a police captain was fatally wounded by four guerrillas who shot him as he walking to his home in <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, 140 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, Sunday night. The other policeman was slain Sunday night in a downtown market in <LOCATION> Pucallpa </LOCATION>, 235 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, according to the officials. Peruvians began receiving their mail Monday when postal service resumed after a strike for nearly two months by members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> who sought salary increases. The government and union reached an agreement Thursday on a wage and benefit package but no details were released. About 85 percent of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s 7,000 postal employees participated in the strike that began Feb. 2 and halted home mail delivery and other services. Officials said some 10 million letters were placed in post office storerooms during the strike. The nation's 70,000 miners stayed on the job after the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> called off a three-day strike set to begin Monday. The union said talks with the government were planned Tuesday and the strike could be rescheduled depending on the outcome of the meeting. Miners were demanding that contracts be negotiated jointly instead of on the current company-by-company basis. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> has been hit with dozens of strikes since the economy spiraled into deep recession a year ago. In most cases, workers demanded pay increases to offset inflation, which hit 1,722 percent in 1988.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A mob with machetes attacked and seriously wounded seven <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missionaries after a pickup truck carrying the Americans accidentally ran over two Haitians, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti-Inter </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official put the number of Americans injured in the incident Sunday at 12, but said none was hurt seriously. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some Americans were hospitalized and that others were treated and released. The report by independent <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti-Inter </ORGANIZATION> said seven Free Methodist Church missionaries were hospitalized in serious condition with multiple machete wounds after the attack, and the two Haitians suffered broken legs. The missionaries and Haitians were not immediately identified. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it was not authorized to release the missionaries' names because of the Privacy Act. The radio station said the attack occurred after the pickup truck went out of control and plowed into the Haitians, who were celebrating the Lenten season on a highway near <LOCATION> Leogane </LOCATION>, about 18 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. Bystanders stoned the truck and set upon the missionaries with machetes, the report said. It did not say what caused the truck driver to lose control. Two witnesses told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the missionaries were saved by the arrival of a soldier, who fired a shot into the air to quiet the crowd. The man and woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said some of the missionaries also were armed and that they fired their weapons. The witnesses said they were driving home to <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Leogane </LOCATION> region when they came upon the scene. They described it as `` nightmarish.'' The truck struck the crowd, and the pedestrians interpreted that action as a deliberate attempt to harm them, the witnesses said. Bands of revelers known as `` ra-ras'' are a Lenten season tradition in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. They wander about, chanting and playing drums and bamboo trumpets. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said the Americans planned to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Tuesday.

 A woman said Monday she will give birth in a camper parked outside the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> to protest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s refusal to let her husband join her in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities are ready to let <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Juwang </PERSON> leave the country, but first want him to clear up what they regard as slanderous charges against the government, an Italian Embassy official in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Patrizia </PERSON> <PERSON> Riccardi </PERSON> is expected to give birth to the child's second couple within days She said she met her husband at a reception in 1986 in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> was employed with the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> delegation to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Riccardi </PERSON> were married in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> two years later, after the birth of their first child, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, and after <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> renounced the diplomatic post that under Chinese law prevented him from marrying a foreigner. Ms. <PERSON> Riccardi </PERSON>, 33, said the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government has confiscated her 28-year-old husband's passport and wo n't allow him out of the country. She said she had written to <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and Italian Foreign Minster <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> seeking their intervention. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, Embassy First Secretary <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Assunta </PERSON> <PERSON> Accili </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabbatini </PERSON> said, `` We've been told several times by the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government that they are willing to permit him to join his wife'' once a dispute over his departure from his <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> post in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in resolved. She said <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> waiting for permission to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Chinese authorities have accused <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> of slandering the government in a letter written to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in which he reportedly says he was forced to quit his job because of his marriage to a foreigner, Mrs. <PERSON> Sabbatini </PERSON> said. The Chinese government says <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> resigned voluntarily and that they replaced his diplomatic passport with an ordinary one after his marriage. The second passport was confiscated after he wrote the letter to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, officials say. Mrs. <PERSON> Sabbatini </PERSON> said the Chinese told the embassy they were discussing the matter with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and would issue <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> a passport once the question of his resignation is clarified. She said the Chinese `` do n't like very much what his wife is doing in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.'' Ms. <PERSON> Riccardi </PERSON> has been living in the camper near the embassy for several days and the police have n't done anything about it. When informed of her plans to have a baby in the camper, a police officers said she has a right to do in it what she wants.

 A reactor closed for more than two years at the <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, National Laboratory can be restarted, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday. The High-Flux isotope reactor has been shut down since November, 1986, when it was found to be suffering from embrittlement of the reactor pressure vessel. The vessels become brittle when continually bombarded with atomic particles as an offshot of chain reactions. Since then, there have been more than 20 safety studies of the reactor and Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON>. <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said Monday he is convinced the operation will be safe. `` I have reviewed the work that has been done to assure the safety of this reactor and I am comfortable with the restart of the reactor,'' said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> in a statement. The reactor is expected to be restarted within five weeks. It will be operated at 85 percent power. The reactor was constructed in 1966 and is used for research on a variety of projects.

 Rebellious inmates Monday night allowed 15 adults and four children o leave a prison where armed convicts and hundreds of family members are standing off army and police forces. The inspector-general of the National Prisons System, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncada </PERSON>, said he does not consider as hostages the more than 600 non-inmates still inside <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>'s biggest prison, 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` They remain there by choice,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview outside the prison's main gate. `` The family members still inside are backing the movement.'' <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncada </PERSON> said the last people considered hostages _ four doctors and two firemen held for 24 hours _ were released at midday. At least four guards and three inmates were killed and 20 people wounded in battles that broke out as prisoners tried to escape on Easter Sunday afternoon. The 19 family members escorted out at 7 p.m. Monday spent about 30 hours in the <PERSON> Pavon </PERSON> prison. Like the 607 family members believed still inside, they were paying Easter visits to jailed relatives when the uprising began. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncada </PERSON> said the prison mutineers had about 75 M-1 carbines taken from prison guard dormitories. He said from 75 to 100 inmates belong to what he repeatedly referred to as `` the movement.'' Officials said about 1,350 inmates are at the 2 -LCB- - square-mile prison farm and up to 100 joined in the revolt Prisoners who did not take part apparently remained in areas not controlled by the rebels. The inspector-general said prisoner demands _ for better food and reduced sentences _ had not changed since Sunday. He said they did not demand a plane to fly to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> as reported by a local radio station. <PERSON> Clementina </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> and her 2-year-old son <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> were among those leaving the prison Monday night. Mrs. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, who was visiting her eldest son <PERSON> Gerardo </PERSON> on Sunday, said she was escorted her out because her little boy had a fever. She said rebels asked visitors if they had health problems that made their stay impossible. <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who was visiting her husband, cried as she spoke from inside a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> van outside the gate. `` I was sick from nerves,'' she said, explaining her departure. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncada </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> ordered prison and other authorities `` to exhaust every alternative'' in negotiating a solution. `` Peace and tranquillity is the strict order,'' he said. Local news reports said <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> gave orders to avoid bloodshed. A 15-minute exchange of gunfire took place Monday morning, but no casualties were reported. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncada </PERSON> said `` serious problems remain'' in resolving the crisis. `` -LRB- The rebels -RRB- must reform their conduct and surrender the weapons.'' Prison spokesman <PERSON> Conrado </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroy </PERSON> earlier told reporters family members `` fear that if they leave, authorities will take reprisals against the rebel inmates.'' Troops were rushed to <PERSON> Pavon </PERSON> when the insurrection began, and on Monday about 1,000 soldiers and police were reinforcing the prison's 180 guards as officials negotiated with the rebels. <PERSON> Monroy </PERSON> said the rebels added to their demands on Monday, saying they wanted to be flown to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. He did not elaborate. Federal Human Rights Director <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Riva </PERSON> spent about five hours inside the prison farm Monday negotiating with the inmates. He reported later that the women and children there need food. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gatica </PERSON>, a journalist for <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grafico </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, entered the prison Sunday as a negotiator. He said a carbine was held at his temple and a knife at his chest for the first few minutes. The inmates `` were aggressive and confused, sometimes arguing among each other,'' he said.

 Computer games, three-dimensional maps and nature trails are being developed to help visitors understand how last year's forest fires were actually useful. Space-age techniques went into the production of some of the interpretive projects, which were considered nine months ago when fires began consuming what would eventually consume nearly half of the 2.2 million-acre park. `` Around the first of July we began to realize that we were not only confronted with an incredible history-making event in terms of fire suppression, but with a virtually unprecedented educational opportunity as well,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s chief naturalist.

 Policy-makers at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, sifting through murky economic data, probably will not tighten credit further this week but will indicate they stand ready to push interest rates higher if inflationary pressures do not abate soon, private economists predicted Monday. The central bank, facing growing political pressure over fears of a possible recession, is likely to postpone further credit tightening for the time being at a meeting this week, many economists believe, although they expect this respite will be brief. Most analysts are forecasting that a variety of interest rates, including banks' prime lending rate and mortgage rates, will be headed higher in the months ahead as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> struggles to keep inflation from getting out of control. So far this year, inflation at the wholesale level has been racing ahead at an alarming annual rate of 12.6 percent, and consumer prices have been rising at a slower, but still troublesome, annual rate of 6.1 percent, up sharply from the 4.4 percent increase in consumer prices turned in during the past two years.

 Call it a reluctance to work on windswept rooftops, knead dough at four o'clock in the morning or get dirty installing furnaces. Whatever the reasons, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is facing a serious shortage of young people interested in skilled manual labor. The situation has become so serious that the federal government in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> is calling on ethnic <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> immigrants and women to apply for the jobs. At the same time, it is urging some students to look to skilled manual labor instead of universities, which are overflowing. At a recent manual labor trade fair in <LOCATION> Kassel </LOCATION>, about 110 miles north of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, construction worker <PERSON> Friedrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, 64, explained what the long-range effects of the trainee shortage might be in his trade. `` Our generation was the one that rebuilt the country after the war,'' he said. `` Sometimes when I look back I ca n't believe what we accomplished. `` Now, with many of us getting ready to retire, and not enough apprentices to train, we're facing an experience gap that will get worse over the next 10 years.'' Education Minister <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Moellemann </PERSON> has proposed that the government increase its annual spending on the training of specialists in labor and technical fields by the equivalent of $ 216 million to $ 1.3 billion. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> recently told the Rhineland Palatinate state Labor Chamber that it should fill the trainee gap with women or young ethnic German immigrants from countries in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` This would not only signal solidarity with our own people and help them,'' he said. `` It can be an enrichment to take on these people, who often show an especially high motivation for work.'' Some old-timers in the country's 126 trades classified as manual labor say West German young people today want only white collar jobs. Federal Labor Office figures for January indicated that 2.3 million West Germans were unemployed, but that only 92,402 of the jobless were youths or new trainee prospects. With so few prospects, employers say that finding manual labor trainees is difficult. <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Gress </PERSON>, who runs a plumbing and heating company in <LOCATION> Koenigstein </LOCATION>, about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, says he has been trying for two years to find an apprentice. `` There just does n't seem to be anyone interested,'' he said. `` I think they see the work as too hard and sometimes dirty.'' <PERSON> Hannelore </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckes </PERSON>, 50, who with her husband <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> operates a bakery in the same town, said their search for a trainee has been fruitless. `` We've tried to find either a young woman or man since the end of the last school year. But no one wants to do manual work anymore. Part of it is because our day starts at 4 a.m., and we work half days on Saturday.'' At the <LOCATION> Kassel </LOCATION> trade fair, <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Griehs </PERSON>, a 65-year-old retired welder, manned a booth advertising for young people to get into the welding business. `` It's not like it was when I became an apprentice,'' he said. `` In those days we were encouraged and proud to become master tradesmen. `` Parents and schools are partly at fault because they push children to keep studying for office work and computers rather than work with their hands.'' He said industries, such as automakers, hire away many young people with starting salaries as high as $ 550 a month, while most apprentices in manual trades average $ 190 to $ 375 a month. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinhold </PERSON>, 57, a senior construction worker at another booth at the fair, said the building industry has its own special problems that discourage youth. `` When you move heavy stones around to build houses from age 16 on, by the time you're 45 your spine is so worn out you ca n't walk straight anymore. The young know this.''

 The night is dark and dismal on Dresdener Street. Suddenly, bizarre lights and music burst from a rusty old vending machine as miniature monsters stare sinisterly from inside. No, this is not `` The Twilight Zone.'' It's the `` Blumenautomat Galerie,'' where a few coins buy strange, tiny sculptures created by <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Glueckman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Suwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Laimanee </PERSON>, and a show that keeps fans coming back for more. In its previous life, the `` Blumenautomat Galerie'' -LRB- Flower Automat Gallery -RRB- was an after-hours vending machine that dispensed posies to passers-by. But now it is one of the most talked about multimedia art events in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, pulling its creators out of years of obscurity. Glueckman and <PERSON> Laimanee </PERSON> came up with the idea as an alternative means of promoting their modernistic concept of art, and say it is <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s only 24-hour art gallery. `` This is not what you would call a conventional exhibition. It's not what you would call a normal thing,''' acknowledged the wry, 37-year-old <PERSON> Laimanee </PERSON>, who is originally from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. The man-size automat is bolted to a wall on dimly lighted <ORGANIZATION> Dresdener </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION>, a cul-de-sac in one of the poorest sections of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Placed inside the machine's 12 compartments are toy-like creations made by <PERSON> Laimanee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glueckman </PERSON> at the made-to-sell price of about $ 3.80 each. The Flower Automat Gallery is a humble but eerie-looking machine. Indeed, sometimes it seems to have a life of its own. Laimanee deposits coins and pulls a bug-eyed monster sculpture from one of the compartments. The left-hand side of the rusty machine bursts into a brilliant light show, to the accompaniment of strange music put together by <PERSON> Laimanee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glueckman </PERSON> on a tape recorder. Two minutes later, the show is over and the vending machine has returned to a state of repose. `` Our Flower Automat Gallery is really a work of art in itself,'' said <PERSON> Laimanee </PERSON>. Every four weeks the artists change the miniature creations and play host for the premiere of a new show. <PERSON> Laimanee </PERSON> also has to fill up the machine every day because of the great public demand. The Flower Automat Gallery has captured the curiousity of arts enthusiasts across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 As a <LOCATION> Rhodesian </LOCATION> soldier, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore-King </PERSON> believed the good were white, the evil were black and the war he fought was a noble struggle waged in the name of Christian democracy. A decade later, he is convinced the war to prevent black majority rule was immoral and looks back with shame at how he and thousands of other white Rhodesians accepted `` simplistic, jingoistic nonsense'' from their leaders. Far worse, he says his fellow whites still hold blacks in contempt and he fears they are throwing away their last chance for peace in the land now called <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. Once a member of an elite counterguerrilla force, the Grey Scouts, <PERSON> Moore-King </PERSON> has written the first published reproval of the seven-year war by a former supporter of white rule. In `` White Man Black War,'' Moore-King accuses the leaders _ `` Elders,'' he calls them _ in what was the breakaway British colony of <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> of an inflexibility that led to the deaths of 1,400 whites and 27,000 blacks before the white minority gave up power under British pressure in 1978. `` These Elders valued the comfort of their lifestyles beyond the lives of their children,'' Moore-King writes in the book published by <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s year-old <ORGANIZATION> Baobab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was greed that sent us to war.'' The 134-page volume has caused a stir among blacks and whites who fought or lived through the conflict that ended with <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION>'s transition to independent, black-governed <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> It provoked numerous reviews in the local media, with one white lawyer saying the book `` was like peeling a scab off and seeing how well the wound was healing.'' <PERSON> Moore-King </PERSON>'s unforgiving and brutal accounts of war atrocities form the basis of his scathing indictment of <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION>'s leaders. He particularly assails <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the prime minister of <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION>, calling him the whites' `` High Priest.'' `` Mr. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, along with the farmers, businessmen, and other politicians told us that we were not fighting to persecute, oppress, or deny our black countrymen _ we killed and burned to save them from communism,'' Moore-King writes. `` The shameful part of our history is not that we were wrong, just that we were so childishly thoughtless,'' <PERSON> Moore-King </PERSON> said in an interview at his modest home in <LOCATION> Ruwa </LOCATION>, about 20 miles east of <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> -LRB- formerly <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION> -RRB-, the capital. The house is off a dirt road surrounded by <PERSON> African </PERSON> <PERSON> bush </PERSON> and black neighbors. Moore-King, 36, said the book, published in December and now into its second printing, was born of anger and fear he felt after returning to his homeland in 1985 after a seven-year absence. `` I feared the whites in this country were screwing up the opportunity to live in this land,'' he said. `` They have been given a second chance in a way.'' An estimated 90,000 whites remain in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> out of the 250,000 or so in the early 1970s. `` The irony is that having lost the war, we have n't lost the lifestyle,'' Moore-King added. Most whites in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> live in spacious homes, many with swimming pools and tennis courts and cared for by black servants. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who still lives in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, said he does not intend to read `` White Man Black War'' and dismissed Moore-King as a `` crank.'' `` It seems at one time he was a great Grey Scout,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> in a telephone interview. `` Now he's turned against everything he once believed.'' Moore-King, who is bearded, broad and imposingly tall, was a sergeant in the Grey Scouts, a mounted infantry unit used as a mobile fireforce and specializing in high-speed tracking. In flowing, impressionistic style, his book recounts wanton destruction, torture and pointless massacres. Soldiers mistakenly bomb a schoolhouse in which black civilians have taken refuge, and 123 are killed. A `` nanny and two pics'' walking home late at night are gunned down by inexperienced young soldiers who mistake them for guerrillas. A black man hangs spreadeagled on a steel bed-frame while a soldier sends electric jolts through wires attached to his scrotum and a nipple. Moore-King left <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> in 1978 and wandered around <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for several years, still believing the war was a noble affair. `` I swore I was n't a racist and justified it by saying I did n't hate black people, they just were n't ready for independence,'' he said <PERSON> Moore-King </PERSON>'s attitude began to shift when he went to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the early 1980s and worked at an insurance agency on an equal basis with blacks. When he returned to <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> upon the death of his parents he feared retaliation by the black government. Instead, he said, he was welcomed back by blacks who treated him with respect. But he found attitudes little changed among whites. In his book, <PERSON> Moore-King </PERSON> tells of a moment soon after his return when his landlord found him sharing tea on his porch with a black neighbor. Not only were Moore-King and his wife evicted, but the landlord locked the vegetable garden Moore-King had left to his black friend. The book paints the pitiful scene of the hungry black man looking longingly through a fence at tomatoes rotting on the vine. `` It was one of a number of things that I thought were repugnant morally, but also dangerous and stupid the way anger was being stirred up in blacks,'' said <PERSON> Moore-King </PERSON>, who plans soon to leave his job as a <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> insurance agent to work on his second book. `` I can understand now why our countrymen took up arms against us,'' he wrote in his first book. `` And if these actions and attitudes and forms of selective ignorance displayed by my tribe once caused blood and fire to spread across the land called <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION>, what will these same actions and attitudes and forms of selective ignorance produce in this land called <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>?''

<HEAD>Traveling in Albania, Europe's Last Adventure</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TIRANA, Albania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` Land of <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>! ... thou rugged nurse of savage men,'' wrote Lord <PERSON> Byron </PERSON>, perhaps <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>'s most famous literary tourist. Albanians have changed since he visited in the early 18th century, but being a tourist in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most isolated country still is an adventure for outsiders. Whether arriving at <LOCATION> Tirana </LOCATION>'s bumpy airport, touring the picturesque countryside or lounging on the marvelous beaches, a traveler seems constantly surrounded by the same faces: <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>'s ever-present secret police, the <LOCATION> Sigurimi </LOCATION>, keep an eye on all foreigners Traffic on the winding, narrow roads is almost nonexistent, with only the occasional truck or horse-drawn cart bumping along in the dust. That's probably why Albanian drivers have an unnerving tendency not to worry so much about sharp curves, to the horror of their foreign passengers. `` But what if we run into <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>'s other bus,'' a foreigner on a tourist bus joked, eliciting a sour glance from the Albanian driver. The wild and jagged mountains of <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>'s interior offer breathtaking views of forests and streams in deep precipices, while the few and scattered villages are surrounded by carefully tended terraced fields. In the countryside, only women are seen tilling the communal fields and small plots each family has been allotted in an apparent attempt to increase food supplies. The long, sandy beaches and the lack of crowds make <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>'s Adriatic seaside resorts a far cry from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s crowded summer retreats, although one is apt to run into the ever-present men in dark suits and sunglasses among the bathers Since World War II, <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> has been sealed off by the harshest Communist regime in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The isolationism and fear of the outside world is exemplified by the thousands of empty bunkers in the countryside and on beaches. The weapon slits in the bunkers are mostly bricked over now that <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> has decided it does not have to be on the alert against invasion. But moonlight dips in the sea are strictly forbidden, and police patrol the beaches, apparently to discourage citizens from swimming off to the nearby <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Corfu </LOCATION> or to the foreign ships riding at anchor. Visitors are often lodged in hotels built by the Italians when they ruled <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> before or during World War II. Most of the furniture and fittings in the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Durres </LOCATION> appear to be left over from that period. Lodging comes moderately expensive for foreigners _ 280 lekas -LRB- $ 40 -RRB- a day for the room only. <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> closed its borders with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> in the 1940s, and ordinary Albanians are forbidden to travel abroad. The 10,000 foreign tourists who come annually are restricted to organized group travel. No Americans are allowed, however, since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is still considered <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>'s foremost enemy. Most of the tourists are from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. There is very little to do in the evenings, since nightlife as it is known in the West is nonexistent, and the primary entertainment for Albanians is to watch television programs from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. Albanians used to hide TV antennas under the rooftops of their homes. When the Communist leader <PERSON> Enver </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoxha </PERSON> died in 1985, after a 41-year rule, citizens gradually became bolder and put them outside for better reception. Forests of antennas now sprout from decrepit concrete apartment blocks where most Albanians live. Few women are seen on the streets of towns. There are fewer cars and no pets. Food is not plentiful in <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, and citizens choose not to waste it on dogs and cats.

 <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Junger </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, noted for their hip, urban comedies, have turned to the soil for their newest series, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Heartland.'' `` Heartland'' may be the first television comedy to milk laughs from farm folk without portraying them as `` aw-shucks'' hayseeds. `` This is from an idea that's been percolating for a while,'' said <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>. `` We started a long time ago with the idea that the farm is the last of the family businesses. And although the American family farms are disappearing, the people running them are some of the most clever and inventive people in business. People on farms are now sophisticated and no longer culturally isolated. `` Rather than the images we were raised with, we wanted to portray them as the last vestige of the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>. Farming is a complex business that requires you to be mechanic, veterinarian, agronomist and many other things all at once. In talking to farmers we found that it was laughter that helped them get through the hard times.'' `` Heartland,'' which made its debut on March 20, stars <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliland </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Layman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristofer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Devin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratray </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daisy </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> as a family living in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. It was created by <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Reo </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> has urged its 42 organizations in 35 states to ask its members to watch the show. Other Witt-Thomas shows are `` The Golden Girls,'' `` Empty Nest'' and `` Beauty and the Beast.'' <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, starring in his seventh series, portrays family patriarch B.L. <PERSON> McCutcheon </PERSON>. <PERSON> McCutcheon </PERSON> is outspoken and cantankerous, two characteristics <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> virtually holds a patent on. He's lost his own farm and lives with his daughter and son-in-law. Daisy <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> McCutcheon </PERSON>'s granddaughter, is <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>'s real-life daughter. `` That allows us to play to a very primal conflict,'' said <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>. `` Very few fathers ever believe that their son-in-law is worthy of their daughter. That's a great source of comedy and conflict. There's little that they agree on, from raising children to farming to politics.'' Both <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> agreed that it was hard to launch a show with only six episodes on a third-place network. `` It's tough to get sampling at any time, and it's especially tough to get the audience to sample a show with only six episodes,'' said <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>. `` The phrase we use is, ` it's tough to hit the green.''' Partners since 1976, <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> have produced such shows as `` Soap,'' `` <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>,'' `` It Takes Two `` `` Hail To the Chief'' and `` I'm a Big Girl Now.'' In the past, both worked for <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Productions </PERSON> and Spelling-Goldberg Productions. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> is the son of entertainer <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> is married to writer-producer <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who created `` Soap'' and `` The Golden Girls.'' `` Bureaucracy is the enemy of comedy,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who wants to keep the company small. `` Most major studios have n't been as successful as the independent producers with comedy.'' The Witt-Thomas show `` Beauty and the Beast'' was a big risk for the producers. A one-hour show is a financial burden for an independent producer, because the network licensing fee does not cover all the costs. <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> said `` Beauty and the Beast'' was hurt by the writers' strike, which delayed its fall premiere to Nov. 19, and by its temporary move from Friday to Monday nights The concept of a noble, heroic man-beast living underground in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> could easily have turned out corny without the right execution. `` It's an epic love story,'' said <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>. `` It's also very literate and stylized. The people read <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> and poems. It was a risk creatively and financially. It's still not profitable. But every once in a while you find something you want to do because you like it.''

<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> is two weeks into his fifth year as a hostage in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and business is proceeding about as usual, which means that none is evident. For the hostages, business as usual means only waiting. Now that the four-year anniversary observances are over, the hostage issue is back on the back burner, an agonizing, frustrating riddle in which nine Americans are held captive and silent by Moslem extremists who are themselves silent most of the time. After a Capitol Hill ceremony on the <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> anniversary date, March 16, there were going to be yellow ribbons on display around <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and a resolution seeking action to end the hostage ordeal, although no specific step was or could be proposed. Neither ribbons nor resolutions are in evidence. Not that they would change the situation, but it has dragged now to the point at which symbols become substitutes for acts no one has been able to devise. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested as he took office two months ago that moves by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to assist the hostages, to establish contact and help gain their release, would be a significant step toward a time of better relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. There was no response. He has said no more on the subject. That is the standstill into which <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> now proposes to move with a renewed humanitarian campaign for the release of foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Fifteen are known to be held, nine of them Americans. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said they should n't be left out of mind because they are out of sight. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, has been held longer than any other hostage. He and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> became acquainted when <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> covered the release of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, a downed flier held for a month by the Syrians. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> to appeal for <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>'s release and to escort him home. He said he would go back to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> now to work for the release of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and the others if he had leads, contacts and indications such a mission would help. First, he said, there should be a humanitarian appeal in messages on radio, on television and in Lebanese newspaper advertisements. He said he is looking for sponsors to finance that effort. `` In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the captors are basically nameless and faceless,'' he said in an interview at his <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> headquarters. `` Therefore the appeal has to be a broad-based appeal to religious and political leaders and others who care.'' The black civil rights activist and two-time <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate said such appeals were making headway and might have succeeded in 1985, but were undercut by the administration's arms deals with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Two American hostages were freed during the arms dealings. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> invited the interview on his projected renewal of public appeals in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for release of the hostages. He said private appeals can work. `` We should not interfere with the government in its efforts,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` But the government's efforts are both modest and ineffective.'' He acknowledged that he does n't know what efforts the new administration is planning or making for the hostages. Humanitarian appeals have been made before, and have failed before. Indeed, one of the men who made them, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, envoy of the archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION>, was himself kidnapped on Jan. 20, 1987, and remains hostage. The captors, after all, are no humanitarians. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said they can not operate without the tacit support, or at least acquiescence, of the society around them. `` We want to put the focus again back on the captured as well as on the basic agony of the captors,'' he said. `` We need to have those holding the hostages know that Americans are concerned about the rebuilding of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, about the children in the camps, about the invasions and the bombings. `` We are concerned about that. So was <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>.''

<TEXT>
 At a time when the French are trying to whip up enthusiasm for the 200th anniversary of their Revolution, visitors will be treated to an American exhibition in <LOCATION> Galeries </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s best-known department store. A major art exhibition will form the backbone of the show in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> store, which also includes a Tex-Mex restaurant, a demonstration of Navajo arts and crafts and phone booths offering free three-minute phone calls to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The exhibition might be dubbed the biggest `` show and sell,'' gambit ever attempted in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> because it's also a commercial enterprise aimed at selling thousands of items `` made in the U.S.A.'' `` We feel the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was the most obvious choice for our annual show devoted to a foreign country,'' said <PERSON> Jean-Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Girardin </PERSON>, director of promotions and sales. He pointed out that people in both countries battled for liberty in the late l8th century, and that the <PERSON> Marquis </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafayette </PERSON>, a French statesman, had championed the American patriots' cause as a general under <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> in the American Revolutionary War. <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>'s gesture was viewed suspiciously by the French, who first condemned him but finally welcomed him back as a hero in 1781 when they saw how he'd defeated their arch-enemies, the English. The exhibition of 50 American paintings from the <ORGANIZATION> Wadsworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atheneum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, is the most important such show sponsored by a retailer in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` Chosen by the museum's curator, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaughy </PERSON>, the paintings will cover the chief periods of art in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Galeries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lafayette </ORGANIZATION>. Insured for $ 50 million, the canvases will range from the works of the scenic <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> to the abstract expressionism of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> and the pop art of <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>. Also on show will be <LOCATION> Whistler </LOCATION>'s `` Coast of <LOCATION> Brittany </LOCATION>,'' as well as <ORGANIZATION> Winslow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homer </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Boy in a Dory,'' <PERSON> Georgia </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>'s upside down painting of <PERSON> D.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>'s pine tree and an impressionistic landscape of Etretat, a beach in <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION>, by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Inness </PERSON>. `` This will be a new kind of audience for an art show,'' said <PERSON> Girardin </PERSON>, intimating that these casual visitors would have fewer preconceived ideas than the usual culture vultures at art exhibitions. Bound to be a crowd-pleaser are 16 vintage cars contributed by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to be placed on the rooftop terrace. Long queues are expected for the first week of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> phone-booth exhibit, when free phone calls to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be offered from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. as part of a credit-card promotion. Navajos from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, will be on hand in their workshop-boutique to demonstrate how they weave rugs, make pottery and silver jewelry. And elsewhere, professional seamstresses will demonstrate the fine art of making a quilt. Skateboard demonstrations by Californians are expected to knock'em off their feet, if the <ORGANIZATION> Harley-Davidson </ORGANIZATION> motorcycle exhibit does n't first. And a French cactus buff will show off new breeds of the prickly succulent. While the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> restaurant from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Les </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Halles </LOCATION> district serves up chili con carne, gastronomes may also sample treats at the `` typically American'' food shop. The eclectic food selection will either fascinate Gallic gourmets or send them galloping away in droves: frozen yogurt, pop corn, diet products, biologic food products, wine without alcohol and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> bourbon for kicks. The <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was to contribute cookery items considered `` indispensable to the American way of life'' including a corn popper, a milk-shaker, a dough-kneader and a hot dog cooker. Fashions, home furnishings, accessories and leisure products will complete the vast show. Designer styles will be from Paris-based <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON>, <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tahari </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuville </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Max </PERSON>. French couture will make a cameo appearance on about 20 models fashioned by top designers for Barbie dolls. The Saks boutique will not only show and sell red-white-blue socks and beach robes, but offer chocolate cake and <ORGANIZATION> Bloody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marys </ORGANIZATION> to cheer the weary. In a more sedate vein, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Museum of Modern Art will have a gift shop of museum copies. With all this American razzle-dazzle, what does the French store expect to be the biggest sensation? `` Well, maybe some of that naughty underwear the Californians are going to show,'' said <PERSON> Girardin </PERSON>. `` It may be like taking coals to <ORGANIZATION> Newcastle </ORGANIZATION>, but I've never seen any worse even up in our red-light district, <LOCATION> Pigalle </LOCATION>.'' Similar shows in 14 branches around the country will take place at the same time, from March 29 to April 30.

<HEAD>Chinese Students Flock to Japan with Visions of Big Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chinese students are flocking to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as language students, but many come only for the big money they can earn _ 20 times wages at home _ in jobs outside the classroom, immigration officials say. Some come in hopes of eventually getting to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Many fall victim to unscrupulous language schools that charge inflated fees for bogus study programs and introductions to the Japanese sponsors they need for visas. Foreign students in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are allowed to earn the equivalent of $ 1,000 a month, a fortune by Chinese standards. Last year, 28,256 Chinese entered <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to study Japanese, up from 1,199 in 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> says. Many, if not most, use the language study as a pretense to get into <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Only about 1,600 Chinese students came last year to pursue formal studies, from literature to management, at regular universities and graduate schools. They do n't fall into category of those who come mainly to work. The flood came after <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> changed immigration rules in 1987 to permit language students to work as much as 20 hours a week. `` The Chinese come because they hear they can earn 2 million yen -LRB- $ 16,000 -RRB- in two years,'' said immigration spokesman <PERSON> Sadao </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawakita </PERSON>. `` The schools are vastly overbooking. In January we cracked down on 23 schools with a capacity of 5,000 that had accepted applications _ and fees _ from 15,000 Chinese who now wo n't get visas.'' The schools were ordered to restructure by July. One, which issed phony sponsorship papers, was closed down. Today 38,000 Chinese in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> alone are waiting for Japanese visas. In December, thousands rallied at <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Consulate in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> demanding visas for which they had paid brokers and protesting stricter rules on guarantors. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> requires that foreign students have guarantors _ Japanese with an annual salary of at least 5 million yen -LRB- $ 40,000 -RRB- who vouch for the students' conduct and financial well-being. Finding guarantors has become a big business, with student brokers borrowing or sometimes inventing names they `` sell'' to Chinese desperate for a visa. `` I paid a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> ` visa broker' 2,700 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars to find me a guarantor,'' said a 21-year-old electrician who identified himself only as <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON>. He had to borrow virtually all of it, he said, so he works 56 hours a week _ in violation of immigration rules _ at a restuarant and sends home 80,000 yen -LRB- $ 640 -RRB- monthly. Tuition averages 30,000 yen -LRB- $ 240 -RRB- a month. Most Chinese language students work as day laborers or in restaurants, bars and small factories. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zizhong </PERSON>, 27, works six days a week at a small printing factory for 600 yen -LRB- $ 4.80 -RRB- an hour, standard for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. He also works some nights sorting letters until dawn at a post office where about 100 other Chinese work part time for 1,000 yen -LRB- $ 8 -RRB- an hour. He said he takes naps in Japanese class and during breaks at the printing plant. He and others also violate the 20-hour immigration rule. Violators generally get away with it because the students often work in more than one place and pay no taxes, making it difficult for authorities to keep track of them. A radio technician from <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> named <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> says he saves 50,000 yen -LRB- $ 400 -RRB- a month and wants to bring his girlfriend to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and then try to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> paid 90,000 yen -LRB- $ 720 -RRB- to his school _ one of the 23 that were disciplined _ to find his girlfriend a guarantor. `` Now they ca n't do it, and I do n't think I'll see that money again,'' he said. Like Shen, many Chinese dream fervently of going to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and some make it, usually if they have relatives there. Others go to great lengths trying. `` We get dozens of Chinese every day seeking permanent residence,'' said a consular officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Bolivian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` But I do n't think they even know where <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> is. They somehow have this idea that this is how they can get to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' But one woman from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, who works nights as a club hostess, said she had a different goal. `` I want so much to go to college. But in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> I ca n't, I'm too old,'' she said. `` I do n't really like Japanese or <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, but I had no chance to go anywhere else.''

<HEAD>More West German Youths Opt Out of Military Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOGNE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The war veterans at the Riehler Home for the Aged tend to get more riled up about the earrings and tiger-striped pants worn by `` civvies'' than the fact that the young men have refused military service. Civvies, or civilian servants, are conscientious objectors who opt for their constitutional right to reject military service and work instead in the most menial of health care and manual labor jobs. Amid an increasingly tolerant West German public and an imminent lengthening of both military and civilian service terms, the number of young men filing for conscientious objector status has climbed dramatically in recent months. The pacifist corps grew by more than 22 percent last year alone, swelling the force to a record 85,000 and rekindling worries among some labor union officials that the civvies who earn only about 300 marks -LRB- $ 160 -RRB- a month will take jobs away from regular workers. On the whole, however, civvies are finding widespread acceptance among their countrymen. `` We have occasional problems between the conservative older residents and the <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> workers, but it is more often an objection about the kind of clothes they wear than their moral or political views,'' observed <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON>, a psychologist in charge of care for the 1,200 residents of the Riehler home, the nation's largest facility for the elderly `` The residents are actually more likely to lash out at each other, calling this or that one an old <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION>.'' Civvies like 24-year-old <PERSON> Gerd </PERSON> <PERSON> Daassen </PERSON>, who has been feeding, bathing and cleaning up residents at the <LOCATION> Riehler </LOCATION> home since October, confirm that their decisions against bearing arms stir little hostility. `` A lot of them ask me why I am doing this instead of serving in the army,'' <PERSON> Daasaen </PERSON> said during a break. `` But it seems to be more a curiosity than a judgment. When I tell them that I can not kill another man, and therefore have to reject military service, they seem to understand.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hintze </PERSON>, federal commissioner for the <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview at his <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> office that he considers the broad acceptance of conscientious objection in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` a sign of a healthy and mature society.'' `` In the 1960s, the public reaction was very negative. The phrase used then for civilian servants was ` shirker','' said <PERSON> Hintze </PERSON>, a former Anglican minister. `` In the 1970s, there was mostly skepticism, ` Who are these guys?' people wondered. But now, as the 1980s draw to a close, the choice of civilian service is broadly accepted.'' The pacifist trend among West Germans began abruptly in 1968, a year of widespread student protests against militarism and a time of anxiety over the Vietnam War. Refusal to bear arms has grown steadily ever since. <PERSON> Hintze </PERSON> and his adviser, <PERSON> Achim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, attribute most of the sharp rise in civilian service entries over the past year to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to lengthen the obligatory army service from 15 to 18 months beginning in June. The civilian service term now is 20 months but will be extended to two years after June. `` The willingness to serve longer demonstrates commitment to the alternative service,'' said <PERSON> Hintze </PERSON>, a civvie himself in the 1970s. Civvies serve longer because they often can find positions in their own communities, while soldiers have to wear uniforms, put in longer hours and live away from home. All West German men reaching the age of 18 are obligated to register for military service, but education deferments are easily obtained. <PERSON> Hintze </PERSON> said the percentage of military draftees refusing army service has grown steadily over the past two decades to about 12 percent. That figure is significantly larger than in neighboring countries, where usually less than 1 percent called for service refuse to bear arms. West Germans' acceptance of conscientious objectors can be explained in part by the nation's tragic experience with war and militarism during the first half of this century and its position on the frontline with Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The nation's Basic Law, set down 40 years ago when the new postwar West German state was formed, was the first constitution in the world to grant citizens the right to chose an alternative to military service. The civvies most often find jobs caring for the elderly and handicapped, but they also get into fields like environmental protection, zoo and park maintenance and search and rescue.

 Historian <PERSON> Karl-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracher </PERSON> likes to compare <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to a young man just out of college, shakive parents and plunging headlong into a world full of opportunity and danger. Youthfully ing off protectvibrant and economically strong, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has let go of the apron strings of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which gave it political guidance and physical nourishment in the first hard years of a statehood founded on the ruins of the Third Reich. Now engaged in a flirtation with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> that its elders in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance fear may be a naive or dangerous courtship, the nation has been rebelling against the familial bounds of bloc diplomacy and the burdens of a shared deGermans on both sides of the border that reunification is still possible. But West Germans concede the prospects are slim as time heals the wound of separation and a new generation with no memory of one <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> becomes the majority in both states. The future holds out little hope of improvement for East Germans. The socialist leadership of <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> has failed to embrace either the social or economic reforms championed by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> maintains that a wholesale revamping of the type <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> espouses with his `` perestroika,'' or rebuilding project, is unnecessary in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> because of his nation's relative success among the socialist states. The 76-year-old <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, reported at times to be in ill health but showing no signs of an intent to bow out as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, dismisses suggestions of a unified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as an unrealistic refusal to deal with the political facts. He has also dashed hopes that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the age of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and glasnost might be willing to dismantle the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall that Western leaders have labeled an anachronism of the Cold War. Responding to appeals during a recent <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> human rights conference that the wall be torn down, <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> declared it would stand another 50 or 100 years, as long as the differences dividing East and West demand it. The wall was erected in 1961 to stop the flood of East Germans seeking refuge in the West. `` Contrary to its intention, it is daily proof that the question it tried to answer remains unanswered,'' West German President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> has said. `` It makes the idea of belonging together conspicuous, an idea which it sought to make us forget.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's a vast, enigmatic wilderness sitting incongruously in the midst of the New York-Philadelphia megalopolis, ringed by the urban sprawl that gave <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> a bad name.

 To the nature buff, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pinelands </ORGANIZATION> are miles of pygmy pines, deep forest, creeks and bogs. To romantics, the Pinelands might be symbolized by the <LOCATION> Waretown </LOCATION> cabin where fiddler <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> once played through the night, or the general store in <LOCATION> Chatsworth </LOCATION> that still offers a table for coffee and gossip. In folklore, it's the birthplace of the <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Devil </LOCATION>, a place where men live in caves and marry their sisters. But to some landowners, `` Pinelands'' is only a title, an annoying federal designation that stifles development and profit. In reality, the more than 1.1 million acres comprising the Pinelands in southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> are a unique medley of tremendous historical and environmental significance. Ringed by the urban sprawl that gave <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> a bad name, the region gained national recognition in November 1978 when President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> signed the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> and Recreation Act that included the creation of the <ORGANIZATION> Pinelands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s act stopped any talk of a supersonic jetport in the middle of this vast space, a frightening prospect for an area already being invaded by the rush of metropolitan housing developers. Ten years ago, it seemed that nothing within two hours of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> would be left untouched. But the <ORGANIZATION> Pinelands </ORGANIZATION> reserve, the largest remaining open tract in the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states, was saved. In a unique arrangement, the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> manages the federal reserve, keeping large-scale development in outlying areas and maintaining the undisturbed nature of thousands of acres in the middle. The state, with federal financial help, is slowly buying property to add to the total reserve, most of which is still privately owned. The state <ORGANIZATION> Pinelands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> now operates with a management plan that is both commended and condemned. In addition, 56 municipalities within the Pinelands are involved in modifying their master development plans to make them conform with the goals of the protection effort. `` When the <ORGANIZATION> Pinelands </ORGANIZATION> plan developed, there had to be accommodations, and some people were hurt and some people were helped,'' says <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toms </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` But the overall picture that has emerged in 10 years has been on the side of good. We have been able to control growth, which is not happening in the rest of the state.'' More than 100 years ago, the parts of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> May, <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> counties that are now the <ORGANIZATION> Pinelands </ORGANIZATION> made up a prosperous region filled with iron, charcoal and glass industries utilizing the bountiful raw materials. In later years, sawmills and wineries flourished. Today, only the names of Colonial-era villages remain, along with remnants of the `` Piney'' lifestyle. Few still follow the tradipine cones, clams and <PERSON> sphagnum </PERSON> <PERSON> moss </PERSON> to live off the land. `` The Pinelands heritage is going to die off very soon,'' says <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, a Tabernacle blueberry farmer who grew up among generations of <LOCATION> Pineys </LOCATION>. `` We do n't even have much of a historical society anymore. The young people do n't want to get involved. `` Older homes are getting torn down, because the younger generation is not about to live primitive. And people are still living in the woods, but with all the modern conveniences.'' Some southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> natives are flattered to be called a `` Piney.'' But not others. `` A Piney is a three-headed incestuous idiot that ca n't walk or talk,'' says <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>, a member of a <ORGANIZATION> Pinelands </ORGANIZATION> band. `` We are ` indigenous' residents _ born here, raised here, growed up here and will die here. Pineys are people who moved here from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> to live off the land.'' <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>, picking on a guitar nearby, chimes in: `` The whole thing is a hoax. The idea of people stumbling around the Pinelands picking sphagnum moss for a living is nice, but it's not hardly real anymore.'' <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> points to his Uncle <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, who builds wooden boats in <LOCATION> Waretown </LOCATION> and was dubbed a `` Piney'' by newspaper reporters who wrote about him and his craft. `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> turns out classic garveys made out of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> white cedar, but he ai n't no Piney,'' <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> says. Ask <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> himself, and he somewhat bashfully agrees. `` Growing up here, we did n't know this would ever be called ` the Pinelands,''' he says. `` We used to call it ` back in the woods.''' Although the lifestyle may wane, action has been taken to protect the <ORGANIZATION> Pinelands </ORGANIZATION>' physical attributes, which include a vast underground aquifer, with an estimated 17 trillion gallons of pure water, and rare cedar and pygmy pines. In 1983, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> designated the region an `` International Biosphere Reserve.'' The Pinelands Management Plan protects a fragile core, and gets increasingly less restrictive as it moves outward. Some areas are designated for agriculture. Others are forest areas that permit low-density residential and commercial development. Larger communities already within the reserve have been classified as `` regional growth areas,'' where most future development will concentrate. But the director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Pinelands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, emphasizes that no part of the reserve will see any major project, such as a toxic waste dump, that could taint the environment. In the process of protecting such a vast tract in a rapidly developing region, the state frustrated many landowners who faced restrictions on their ability to use or profit from their property.

 Newsletters from the <ORGANIZATION> Pinelands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Landowners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> accused the state of `` trying to preserve land by essentially confiscating it ... Meanwhile, taxes continue to be paid by landowners held hostage by the plan.'' Researchers continue to study the Pinelands' fragile ecosystem, right down to the rare Pine Barrens tree frog and the curly grass fern. Medical research also has been conducted in the Pinelands. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Squibb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> microbiologists announced that a new family of microbiotics could be developed from Pinelands soil. But for all the <ORGANIZATION> Pinelands </ORGANIZATION>' beauty and benefits, it is overshadowed as a tourist destination by the popular shore region and relatively few people take advantage of the reserve. Scattered through the scenic Pinelands are attractions such as the historic <LOCATION> Batsto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, a preserved iron-making facility, and a host of hiking trails and rivers for canoeing. `` I do n't think there is enough of an understanding in the state as to what the Pinelands means and how important it is,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> says. `` Most people think it's just a boring, flat landscape.'' Although the <ORGANIZATION> Pinelands </ORGANIZATION>' significance may not be widely and fully appreciated, and its preservation fought by some, the <ORGANIZATION> Pinelands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Does </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanya </ORGANIZATION> have any advice for her sister? `` Stay in school and do n't have kids until you finish school.'' <PERSON> Samantha </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a 17-year-old graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rockaway </LOCATION>, says the pregnant teen-agers she knows `` really do n't understand that once that baby's born, it's going to be hard to feed them and clothe them and take'em places and stuff like that. And that they ca n't really do the things that they used to do.'' But when asked if she used birth control, she said, `` Sometimes, but not really. No. But I'm supposed to start on it soon. But not now.'' <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Trieller </PERSON>, the clinical nurse specialist at <LOCATION> Woodmere </LOCATION>, says that kind of carelessness is common among teen-agers of every stripe. `` In the last five years, with the media talking about herpes and AIDS, adults are being more careful about sex,'' she says. `` It's not affecting the adolescent population because they think they're omnipotent. That's their modus operandi: ` I'm not going to get pregnant. I'm not going to get VD.''' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stream </LOCATION> teen who learned the hard way that she was not immune to pregnancy, laments her abortioo kill a baby,'' she says, `` but I was only 17 at the time and still in school and I was working and my boyfriend was still in school at the time, and his mother never knew. She'd probably be upset if she ever found out.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ The 20th edition of Dewey Decimal Classification, which assigns numbers to library books, is due out this year. It's a simple yet sophisticated system for organizing the world's knowledge, a system that a child can quickly learn. While it must be updated from time to time, some librarians maintain that <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>'s system will `` stand for all time.''

 When <PERSON> Melvil </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> envisioned how a library should be organized more than a century ago, he could n't have guessed how his system would be tested in the future. He could hardly have foreseen in 1873, for example, the invention of computers, or the spread of AIDS and advancements in medical science such diseases engender. Or the high-speed, low-cost printing presses that turn out so very many books each year. Since 1979, over a million volumes have been assigned Dewey Decimal numbers. And with the publication this year of the 20th edition of <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>'s revolutionary system _ the first complete update in a decade _ just about the only constants of the Dewey Decimal Classification are its basic structure and its publisher, <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> But that, after all, was <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>'s vision. The strength and popularity of the system lie in its adaptability. From a slant toward subjects a white, middle-class American male in the 19th century might study _ European literature, the Bible and classical philosophy, Romance and Germanic languages, the natural sciences and history _ the system has assimilated other literatures and cultures to become the most popular method of organizing libraries in the world. `` <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> had definitely a white, Protestant, Anglo-Saxon bias. Over the years, as other editors have worked on the <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>, there has been a constant effort to correct for this,'' says <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Wajenberg </PERSON>, principal cataloger and professor of library administration at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Urbana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wajenberg </PERSON>, who is also on the advisory committee which oversees the <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>'s updates, adds, `` There is a very definite <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bias, Western European bias which is especially damaging as it becomes a worldwide classification.'' Familiar to most grade school children, the Dewey Decimal system is used to organize libraries so books can be found easily. And reports written, languages learned, curiosity quenched. A book is assigned a number to the left of the decimal, placing it in a general category. To the right of the decimal, it is assigned numbers that describe the particular book. By adding or subtracting numbers, a person can find other books on more specific or general topics. New books can be squeezed into the library's catalog in the same way The system is sophisticated enough to catalog millions of volumes and simple enough for a child to quickly learn. So simple and sophisticated, in fact, that its editor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Comaromi </PERSON>, says it will `` stand for all time.'' `` The thing is, it's powerful, it's really powerful,'' he says. `` It really fits human expression of ideas.'' Comaromi is head of the Decimal Classification Division at the <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, where the Dewey numbers are actually assigned. Translated into 34 languages, from German to <LOCATION> Gujarati </LOCATION>, the Dewey system is now used in 95 percent of the world's libraries. It stands in near-constant transition, with differences in the two most recent editions illustrating its changing face. For example, work began on the 19th edition in 1972. When it was published, in 1979, crack cocaine was unknown and there was little published about drugs in general. But as the next decade passed, information piled up and social attitudes changed, prompting major changes in the 20th edition. AIDS had the same effect, with its impact on epidemiology, biochemistry, even sociology, <PERSON> Comaromi </PERSON> says. The rapid rise of computer technology even prompted a separate, between-editions edition, and will prompt future changes in the system itself, as it is adapted for publication in computer form. `` We have this tension between stability in libraries and then advancement and progress for people using the classification as the window into knowledge, to the whole world of knowledge,'' Comaromi says. `` If it's going to be a window into knowledge, it's got to be current.'' That's the sole purpose of <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> _ keeping the <LOCATION> Dewey </LOCATION> in line with what's being published, says executive director <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Paulson </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Melvil </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>, is a former director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>, one of the first libraries to adopt the system. <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> developed his system in 1873 while a student at <ORGANIZATION> Amherst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and worked on it the rest of his life. In 1911, after resigning his post and moving to <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Placid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, he founded <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, housing it at the <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Placid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. In the early 1970s, the press moved to <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, and earlier this year it was purchased by private information-systems giant OCLC of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Although there was at the time neither regular training for librarians nor a widely used classification system, <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> based his system on others, such as the scheme created by former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of Education <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> earlier in the 19th century. While about 200,000 libraries in more than 130 countries now use the <LOCATION> Dewey </LOCATION>, other systems compete for attention. Many major research libraries use the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' scheme, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has its own system, and the Universal Decimal Classification _ derived in the 20th century from the <LOCATION> Dewey </LOCATION> _ is popular in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wajenberg </PERSON> says. But the <LOCATION> Dewey </LOCATION> is king for now. Its real effectiveness can be seen every time an adult enters the public library and finds it familiar, years after first encountering the system. For, as <PERSON> Paulson </PERSON> sums up: `` This is a system for organizing all the world's knowledge.''

 <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Idle </PERSON>, like a knight-errant in comic armor, has cut a swath from <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Python </PERSON>'s Flying Circus in his native <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to his new series for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Nearly Departed.'' He's also found time recently for a role as <ORGANIZATION> Berthold </ORGANIZATION>, the fastest man alive, in `` The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'' and as Passeportout, <PERSON> Phileas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogg </PERSON>'s woman-chasing, wine-bibbing French valet, in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` Around the World in 80 Days.'' In `` Nearly Departed,'' which makes its debut Monday, April 10, he and <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> McWilliams </PERSON> play spirits, only recently departed, who try to dislodge the new occupants from their home. `` It's not polite comedy,'' he says. `` I seriously want those people out of the house.'' Idle was concerned with the lack of time available as he filmed six episodes of `` Nearly Departed.'' `` It takes twice as much time to do comedy,'' he says. `` They do n't give you enough lead time. The writer was reworking the current script while he was writing the next week's script. I did n't do any writing, but I'm allowed to rewrite and punch up. So I put my bits in.'' Idle plays an English lecturer at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> who is killed with his wife by falling rock while on vacation. Instead of heaven or hell, they go back to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to haunt their old home. `` Nearly Departed'' is an original series but the concept has occasionally popped up in such past projects as `` Blythe Spirit'' and `` Topper.'' `` You get a chance to comment on people right in front of them and they ca n't hear you,'' Idle says. `` We haunt <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Pankin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaal </PERSON> and their child, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>. Only the grandfather, <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON>, can hear us. `` It's necessary to have someone you can communicate with or it does n't relate. You ca n't make the comedy work without that.'' Idle was in the forefront of British television's `` golden age of comedy,'' both as a writer and an actor. He did three series with <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Python </PERSON>'s ensemble of nonsense comedians and edited the spinoff books and co-wrote and appeared in three <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Python </PERSON> movies. Idle's role in `` Around the World in 80 Days'' took him to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kwai </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. Some railroad scenes were filmed on the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kwai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Railroad </LOCATION>, the infamous line built by Allied prisoners of war in the movie `` The Bridge Over the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kwai </LOCATION>.'' `` Every foot of the railroad represents someone who died,'' Idle says. `` It's beautiful and chilling at the same time.'' Idle notes that since `` Around the World in 80 Days'' was written by <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Verne </PERSON>, a Frenchman, Passeportout receives a more sympathetic treatment than does the Englishman Fogg. `` Verne pictured <PERSON> Fogg </PERSON> as the punctual Englishman who must have his bath water at a certain temperature,'' Idle says, `` while Passeportout chases women and drinks wine.'' `` The Adventures of <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Munchausen </PERSON>,'' the new epic fantasy from <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, was directed by <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON>, another alumni of <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Python </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> plays the title role. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> plays the king of the moon. `` <PERSON> Munchausen </PERSON> was an 18th-century character who used to boast about his exploits,'' Idle says. `` The tales eventually became short stories that were favorites with children. `` I play an actor who plays <PERSON> Berthold </PERSON> in the play within a play. I had my head shaved for six months in order to play <PERSON> Berthold </PERSON>. He has spent 20 years in prison on the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>.'' Idle describes the movie as an epic fantasy in the mold of `` The Wizard of Oz'' or a <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMille </PERSON> film. He says it's unlikely that the <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Python </PERSON> team will get back together, except perhaps for a special on the 20th anniversary. Members of the ensemble were <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON>, Idle, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Palin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> may not be the busiest actor in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> theater. It just seems that way. In nearly 35 years as a performer, <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> has appeared in 99 plays, 61 of them in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, according to his extensive Playbill biography. He usually shuttles between Broadway's Circle in the Square and off-Broadway's Roundabout Theater Company, sometimes playing both in one season. But his broad, beefy, Irish face is not well-known beyond the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. That may change with <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON>'s critically praised performance in <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON>'s farce, `` Lend Me a Tenor,'' and his growing movie career in such films as `` Children of a Lesser God,'' `` Three Men and a Baby'' and `` Working Girl.'' In `` Lend Me a Tenor,'' now on view at <ORGANIZATION> Broadway </ORGANIZATION>'s Royale Theater, <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> plays an apoplectic opera company manager. In it, he manages to turn frenzy into high, hilarious art. Theater has always been <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON>'s major focus, and he has had seven good reasons to keep working steadily in it. His children: <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Celia </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON>. `` My wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, has been a wonderful manager,'' the 58-year-old <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> says. `` I've never been interested in money. It has never mattered to me. Money was the cause of a great deal of difficulty in my family when I was a kid.'' <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON>'s father was in the small carnival business in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> His family would travel, mostly during the summers, throughout the Northeast. `` As a kid, I used to work mostly in penny pitch,'' <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> recalls. `` Then I began to work ball games where you'd knock the bottles down, then wheel games and when I got older, even gambling joints. It was not your average, run-of-the-mill childhood.'' In Catholic grammar school, the nuns thought <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> was a pretty good reader. It's there he made his stage debut at the age of 12, playing Machevilli the cat in a little something called `` The Fairy Cobbler.'' `` I was a big success because I played with my tail all through the show,'' he says. Acting had made an impression on <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON>. In high school, he appeared in the winter and spring plays, entered elocutionary contests and was on the debating team. He ended up at <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and was a regular on the local <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> theater circuit, including stints at a summer theater in <LOCATION> Olney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and at fledgling Arena Stage. In 1960, <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> and his wife moved to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area for good, settling in <LOCATION> Teaneck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where they still live. His <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> career did not have an auspicious beginning. While rehearsing his first show _ `` Measure for Measure'' in Central Park _ his car was broken into and the belongings he was moving from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were stolen. But the play and <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> got good notices. The actor landed an agent and his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> career was launched. Much of his early days were spent at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in its repertory company run by <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> and <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blau </PERSON>. `` But when <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in 1973, I was out of work for about 18 months,'' he recalls. `` That's the longest I've ever been out of a job. My wife went to work, and I took part-time jobs outside the theater. `` When you are in a reof get insulated and you get removed from the Broadway scene,'' he says. `` You're not thought of for shows. After a while, people stop calling.'' Eventually, people, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Papp </PERSON> in particular, did. <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> went back to <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Center </PERSON>, when <PERSON> Papp </PERSON> took over there, to appear with <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> in <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>'s `` Mrs. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>'s Profession'' and then replaced <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> in `` The Threepenny Opera.'' Since then, <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> has n't stopped working. In `` Lend Me a Tenor,'' <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> co-stars with <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Garber </PERSON>, an actor he has worked with before in `` You Never Can Tell'' and `` The Devil's Disciple'' at Circle in the Square. It was <PERSON> Garber </PERSON> who suggested <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> for the role of the opera company manager to the show's producers and to director <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaks </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s attention to detail is all-encompassing,'' <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> says. `` Nothing escapes him. He will work on a thing until he is satisfied with it. You work very hard. Pace is the critical thing. You have to keep ahead of the audience all the time.'' With farce, <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> says, you sometimes can go too fast. `` I remember coming off and being annoyed with myself because I stumbled over three or four words in a scene,'' he says. `` Usually it's for lack of concentration but in this case it was because I was talking faster than I was thinking. `` That's why comedy is so difficult to play. When you make a mistake, it's so obvious. You can really screw up in a drama, where there are pauses and stops, and no one would know that you've done it.'' At the urging of his family and his agent, <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> has made some 15 to 20 films in the last five years. The roles have been small, but the salaries were enormous. `` You ca n't make any money in the theater,'' he says. `` If you are lucky enough to get in a Broadway show, who knows how long it's going to run. Was it hard to break into movies? `` When you work in the theater, they tend not to think of you for movies,'' <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> says. `` They're just different communities.

Many Argentines today date the steady decline of their economic fortunes since then to a day in February, 1946, when Gen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> visited the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> after being elected president and came out marveling at the pile of gold bars he saw inside. `` You can hardly walk through the corridors,'' he remarked. Argentines still cite those words in looking back. They still have as high a standard of living as anyone in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but they no longer are rich and many blame that on <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> and his policies which still exerting influence long after his heyday and 14 years after his death. He nationalized industries, regulated wages and prices and work conditions, expanded public employment and social welfare programs, convinced millions of Argentines that big government was best. He created a political party that bears his name to carry out his vision. Today, one worker of every six is employed by the government _ about 2 million overall in a population of 30 million. The state subsidizes an estimated 300 companies. The budget usually is in deficit. Natural resources go untapped. Private industry chafes at myriad regulations. `` The state, from 1945 to now, has gotten a little bigger every year, and it has long since reached the point where it can be sustained,'' says <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cresto </PERSON>, chairman of the department of economics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buenos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aires </ORGANIZATION>. `` Everyone realizes what the problem is, but there is no general agreement on a solution,'' says <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Szewach </PERSON>, chief economist at the independent <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The dominance of the state has been one constant in a political and economic maelstrom that has hampered development in a country blessed with resources. Over the years, soldiers ousted civilians and democratic rule gave way to dictatorship. The political and economic `` rules of the game'' changed quickly and often. New regimes have tried to wipe out what came before rather than build on what may have been achieved. Economically, currency-exchange rates have been undervalued and then overvalued. Business has been protected and then forced to face international competition. Wages and prices have been controlled and then set by market forces. Exports have been favored and then imports, agriculture and then industry. Meanwhile, the country slipped into decline _ despite fertile cropland and a temperate climate, rich fishing grounds, abundant deposits of oil, natural gas and uranium, rivers that can be tapped for hydroelectric power, and a literate population not divided by language, religion or race. The gross domestic product has stagnated at about $ 80 billion for a decade. Annual per capita income dropped to the equivalent of $ 1,630 in 1988 from $ 1,990 in 1980, according to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, 62, an attorney and human rights leader, has been president since December 1983. Already, he has outlasted all his predecessors since <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>, but his tenure has been rocky. The military, which unseated <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> in 1955, <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Frondizi </PERSON> in 1962, <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Illia </PERSON> in 1966 and the widow <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> in 1976, has had minor revolts in its ranks three times in the past two years. Human rights groups and other critics maintain the military is agitating again for political power. The radical left also has not given up, despite the brutal crackdown on subversives beginning with <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>'s government in 1974 and carried on by the 1976-83 military regime in which at least 8,963 Argentine civilians were arrested, never seen again and presumed executed, according to the findings of a commission set up by <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. But human rights groups, among them <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, estimate the number of people who disappeared _ `` desaparecidos'' _ at 10,000 to 30,000. Few expect any outbreak of violence such as that recently in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, but if it happens the spark might come from an economy that neither soldiers nor civilians have been able to control. Inflation has been at triple-digit rates in 13 of the past 14 years _ climbing from 24.39 percent in 1974 to 688 percent in 1984 and down to 387.70 percent last year. Unemployment and under-employment stand at a combined 14 percent. The austral currency is devalued every month, and wages often fail to keep up with inflation.

<HEAD>BUENOS AIRES: with inflation.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Looming over everything is the nearly $ 59-billion foreign debt, for which there is almost nothing to show. The military borrowed heavily to balance the budget in the late 1970s. It also used the money to buy military equipment, build highways through <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, subsidize military-run industries and inject money into chronically inefficient state-owned companies. It used some of the money to play host to the World Soccer Cup tournament in 1978. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> has borrowed mostly to pay the interest on the debt but, by his own admission, has paid only 50 percent of the interest due. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s international credit rating now is classified as `` substandard'' and is on the verge dropping to `` value impaired'' because of noncompliance with interest payments. Debt repayment now costs $ 6 billion a year and consumes _ or would if the government paid it _ more than one-half of total export earnings. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is $ 2.5 billion in arrears. In human terms, people who used to drive to work now take the bus or subway. Home ownership for many is out of the question. Vacations are shorter and closer to home. University graduates are emigrating in increasing numbers to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Wage strikes by public employees are common and schoolchildren stay home, mail does n't get delivered, businesmen go to work in car pools. The General Labor Confederation has staged 13 general strikes since <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> became president. The 4-million-member confederation, which was forged by <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>, is lending considerable support to the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, in the presidential elections set for May 14. Perhaps <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s biggest accomplishment has been to hold together a fragile democracy and fractious republic for five years. A main goal, he has said, is to hand over political power to an elected successor in December. That has not happened since 1928. The biggest failure of <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s military predecessor was the war with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, the Malvinas to Argentines. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s biggest failure has been the economy. He has tried without much success to cut the federal budget, reorganize the banking sector, lower trade barriers, increase tax collections and sell the state telephone company and the national airline, <ORGANIZATION> Aerolineas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Argentinas </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s second major anti-inflation plan collapsed in February. In the weeks since, the austral has plummeted by 59 percent against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. Cars valued in australs now seem half-priced to those with dollars. Apartments selling for dollars doubled in cost for buyers with australs. National elections raise the prospect of more instability. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, the front-runner, pledges to dramatically improve workers wages and hints he might not continue payments on the foreign debt. He talks vaguely of a `` productive revolution'' to spur growth and a `` social pact'' to resolve tensions. His main challenger, <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> of <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, pledges to balance the budget, attract foreign investment and sell off state companies despite the opposition of unions. Compounding matters, the election could wind up in the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, where conservative third-party candidate <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsogaray </PERSON> may hold the votes to push one or the other _ probably <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> _ past the required 50 percent of 600 electors. In a recent television interview, <PERSON> Alsogaray </PERSON>, 75, said his grandchildren asked him whether they should study for a career in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, or emigrate. `` I told them they should go abroad,'' he said. A return to the days of the 1920s and 1930s, when beef and grain exports to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> propelled <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> into the top 10 countries in per capita income, is beyond anyone's hope now.

<HEAD>Six Months After Coup, Democracy Remains Elusive in Haiti</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ In a roofless, burned-out church, the congregation sings hymns in Creole about death and crushed dreams. `` They kill us in the street, they kill us in our homes, they kill us inside church.'' The words flowed from 200 or so worshipers during Mass at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the midst of slum. `` The problems of our country make us die like animals. `` Democracy. Democracy.'' In September thugs with machetes, guns and spikes stormed into <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bosco </LOCATION> during <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>, killing 13 people and wounding 70 others before setting the church afire with gasoline. A week later, on Sept. 17, rank-and-file soldiers revolted and put Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril in power. They overthrew Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and stirred hopes for democracy at last in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. The Caribbean-island nation has known almost nothing but brutal dictatorships since winning independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1804 _ the first slave state to become a nation. Today, six months after <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> took over and three years after dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> `` Baby Doc'' <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> flew to exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, there is disillusionment over the pace of promised democratic reforms, while allegations of human-rights violations continue. But <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, who holds a law degree, has made some, albeit slow, progress toward his pled an elected government. His government maintains democracy is the only path for the poorest country in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. `` We've had dictatorships for 184 years and we are still the least developing nation in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. So something is wrong with how we governed,'' said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> in an interview. `` Democracy is not a choice; it's an imperative.'' In February, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> approved the formation of an independent council to oversee eventual elections and he recently restored 291 articles of the 1987 constitution, suspended in June by <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. But 37 articles that mostly restricted the army's role were not revived because, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> said, they were inconsistent with a de facto government. `` You ca n't expect this government to behave like a democratically elected government,'' sociologist <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlanger </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Haitian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview. `` Avril is a product of the system. `` The only thing we have to expect is that he assures a secure, fair and honest democratic process.'' The 50-year-old <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> was <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>'s close financial adviser and people still associate him with the old regime. Many charge he is making reforms merely to win back $ 70 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic assistance. The aid was frozen Nov. 29, 1987, after goonsquads killed 34 people voting in the country's first election in 30 years. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said it wo n't renew aid until democratic government is in place but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could release some funds in the meantime as an incentive. With about 80 percent of the country's 5.5 million people living in dire poverty, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> desperately needs help. `` Witholding aid has been very negative,'' said the foreign minister. `` The social-economic factors have worsened so we can not say how these measures have in any way advanced democracy.'' This year, labor strikes and sporadic demonstrations broke out in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, the capital, and in the provinces with demands for <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> to step down. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Watch and other human rights groups say abuses and arbitrary arrests by the army and paramilitary groups continue to be made of people in peasant organizations, labor unions and church groups. `` The basic human rights situation has not changed,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duval </PERSON>, who was a political prisoner under <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> and today runs a human rights group. `` In the last weeks we have found one to two bodies a night as a result of the political situation.'' <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>'s feared private militia, the <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoute </ORGANIZATION>, was disbanded after <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> fled and some were integrated into the 7,000-member army. But they were chased out by soldiers who brought <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> to power. Although disorganized, the army wields considerable power. `` You're not going to get to power if there's not a reasonable understanding with those guys,'' said presidenial hopeful <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Bazin </PERSON>, a former Finance Minister and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> economist. `` You would be killed or disappear one morning.'' Optimism waned a month after <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> took office when the soldiers who put him in power were jailed, accused of plotting a coup. Three months later, they were released. No explanation was given. But the tide turned in late December when <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> <PERSON> Romain </PERSON>, the notorious mayor of <LOCATION> Port-Au-Prince </LOCATION>, safe passage to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which shares the island of Hispaniola with <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Romain </PERSON>, a retired colonel, was believed to have orchestrated the church massacre and was implicated in the one against voters in 1987. `` Giving <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> safe conduct showed the tendency of the government to preserve the status quo and encourage the Duvalierists to stay on _ not to pursue the murderers of Nov. 29 or the church massacre,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dejoie </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, son of popular industrialist who lost to <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON>'s father, in the disputed 1957 election. Fears also abound that elections would again be disrupted or rigged, as was believed the case in the elections Jan. 17, 1988, when frightened voters stayed home and <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> came to power amid allegations of fraud. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> was overthrown by <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> five months later. `` International pressure would have to be great so they ca n't repeat the events of November or of January's sham election,'' said sociologist <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronceray </PERSON>, the runner-up in the 1988 election About a dozen opposition parties and an array of organizations have emerged since 1986 but are divided. `` The democratic process depends on confidence building between the army and civilians,'' a Western diplomat said. `` Civilians have to trust the army to take its role but not to take control. And you have to have the willingness of the existing government, the quietude of the far left and the tolerance of the far right.'' No one predicts what will happen. The Communist Party, the grassroots `` popular church'' and leftist unions are influential with peasants and the poor. These groups want <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> to step down and allow a coalition government to govern until elections. Many say <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> is caught in the middle. `` He risks being overthrown if he does n't make enough progress. He risks it if he does,'' said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` So he's trying to maintain an equilibrium.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Rooftops,'' ``SING''</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ``SING'' opens March 31.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 `` Rooftops'' Let's hear it for the septuagenarian film director. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Crichton </PERSON>, who made `` The Lavender Hill Mob'' and other comedy classics, scored an Academy Award nomination at 78 for his rollicking `` A Fish Named <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> -LRB- `` Pickup on South Street'' -RRB- is starting another action movie at 77. Now <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, 74, has a new film, `` Rooftops.'' It's not in the range of Wise's `` West Side Story,'' to which it is inevitably compared. But `` Rooftops'' is handsomely produced, directed with kinetic energy and skillfully acted by a youthful cast. Amazingly, `` Rooftops'' was produced on the streets and of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for $ 8 million. Wise's last movie, `` Star Trek: The Motion Picture,'' reportedly cost $ 50 million. Like `` West Side Story,'' `` Rooftops'' deals with urban warfare. The setting is <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s lower <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, where homeless teen-agers live on top of abandoned tenements and earn a meager living by scrounging used plumbing and auto parts. They are at odds with punk gangs and, on a more sinister level, the venomous drug dealers. A straight-arrow loner known only as T -LRB- <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Gedrick </PERSON> -RRB- pumps iron at his watertower apartment and tries to stay out of trouble. Then he falls for <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON> -RRB-, a virtuous girl who has been trapped into serving as lookout for her drug-dealing cousin, <PERSON> Lobo </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Velez </PERSON> -RRB-. Conflict builds to a violent showdown, with T and a few allies mismatched against <PERSON> Lobo </PERSON> and his thugs. While not a musical per se, `` Rooftops'' is scored to continuous rock music by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of the Eurythmics, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamen </PERSON> of <PERSON> Pink </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON>. Plenty of lively choreography is provided by the capoeira, an Afro-Brazilian exercise that combines karate with ballet. Wise's direction is a marvel, capturing the action while drawing credible performances. The stumbling point is <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>'s script, which lacks surprise and explores no new ground in the struggle of survival in the big-city jungle <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Gedrick </PERSON> supplies a strong, sullen presence as the hero, and <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Velez </PERSON> is appropriately terrifying as the heavy. <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON>'s unspoiled beauty and dramatic depth indicate a promising future. Young <PERSON> Alexis </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> provides bright moments as the spray-paint artist Squeak. The New Visions Picture was produced by <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and bears an R rating, for language and violence. Running time: 95 minutes. _ By <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` SING'' Generations of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> high school students have enjoyed one of academia's most popular traditions, Sing. The school song and dance competition between grades at individual schools such as Erasmus Hall and <LOCATION> Midwood </LOCATION> was a joyous and spirited event. It bubbled like the 2 cents plain at <PERSON> Jahn </PERSON>'s ice cream parlor. Unfortunately, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baskin </PERSON>'s recreation of that spirited show in `` SING'' is as flat as a stale egg cream. It was written by <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitchford </PERSON>, and has the same situational formulas as his `` Fame'' and `` Footloose.'' It stars two newcomers, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, who are appealing enough but lack the power and talent to truly carry a movie. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasser </PERSON>, heavier and less frenzied than her `` <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>'' days, co-stars as <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>'s mom. <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracco </PERSON> -LRB- `` Someone to Watch Over Me'' -RRB-, with a heavy Hollywood-style <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> accent, portrays a street-tough teacher who returns to her community. Singer <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBelle </PERSON> -LRB- `` A Soldier's Story'' -RRB- is the only cast member who has enough high energy to dominate the screen and infuse some excitement. But her explosive talent is little used in her role as a teacher who also works with the Sing committee. `` SING'' is centered around the threatened closing of an imaginary <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> high school where the competition has been a community tradition. Students, faculty and members of the neighborhood rally to keep the school open so the skits can be put on, and to retain a way of life. At the same time, a local punk named <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> -RRB- is forced into being a Sing leader by his teacher, Miss <PERSON> Lombardo </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Bracco </PERSON> -RRB-, who is trying to turn him from a life of crime. <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON> falls in love with <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Steen </PERSON> -RRB-, a good student and good girl, and it's like water mixing with oil The movie is sprinkled with enough perky songs to fill an album. <PERSON> Pitchford </PERSON> wrote all the lyrics, with music by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cain </PERSON>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Desmond </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Child </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>. However, there are more misses than hits. The <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Zadan </PERSON> production for <ORGANIZATION> Tri-Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> leaves one thirsting for `` West Side Story,'' or even `` To Sir With Love.'' And the producers might take lessons from the former <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> students who poured so much talent into the Sing competitions: Barbra Streisand, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedaka </PERSON>. `` SING'' is rated PG-13. _ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editor </ORGANIZATION>.

 `` Imagine'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>. VHS-Beta, $ 79.95. Rated PG -RRB- `` Imagine'' bills itself as `` the definitive film portrait'' of musician-poet-pop icon <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>. It's too early to judge this film biography as definitive, but it is certainly a comprehensive, thoughtful and deeply moving study of the most complicated Beatle. Produced by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolper </PERSON> and directed by <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Solt </PERSON>, the film is a compilation of more than 100 interviews with <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> himself, <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>, his first wife, <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON>, sons <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON>, the aunt who raised him, manager <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> and dozens of other lesser characters. The well-paced production -LRB- <PERSON> Wolper </PERSON> and <PERSON> Solt </PERSON> previously collaborated on `` This Is Elvis'' -RRB- contains footage of <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s early years in <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION>, the Beatles' first success in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the group's phenomenal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour, the drugs, the break-up, life with <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON>, alternating between public and private glimpses of the artist Highlights include a combative _ and hilarious _ exchange between <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> and cartoonist <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capp </PERSON>, and a poignant performance of the song `` Imagine'' shortly after <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> wrote it. The film wisely does not end abruptly with <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s assassination in 1980 but moves beyond, showing what his music meant to an entire generation The soundtrack, with nearly three dozen songs, is stunning. _ <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collins </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` The Thin Blue Line'' -LRB- HBO Home Video. VHS-Beta, $ 89.99 -RRB- <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' singular documentary about the circumstances that led to a man being convicted of murdering a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officer and condemned to death is at the very least harrowing in its implications. Before you say it could n't happen to you, read on: It was Thanksgiving weekend in 1976 when <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a day laborer with no criminal record, fell in with <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a 16-year-old juvenile delinquent. They spent the day hanging out. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> says they split up at 10 p.m. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> testified that they were together at midnight, when Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> died during a routine traffic stop, shot to death by a gun <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> had stolen. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> boasted about killing a cop to friends, but when he fingered <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> for the crime, he was believed. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who has maintained he is innocent, landed on death row. His sentence later was commuted to life in prison. What's harrowing is the low-key way in which <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> reconstructs the crime, offers the testimony of witnesses and conducts interviews with the principals. Very gradually you realize that <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> got railroaded by police and prosecutors with the best intentions in the world. They knew he was guilty; it was just a case of fitting the facts to conform to that truth. `` Rashomon'' this is n't, but powerful and persuasive and chilling it is.

 `` <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovett </PERSON> and His Large Band'' -LRB- Curb-MCA -RRB- _ <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovett </PERSON> So besides large, just what sort of band is this? Listen to the album's instrumental opener, `` The Blues Walk,'' and you might think `` large band'' is just a clever name for 1940s `` big band.'' But wait. Next comes `` Here I Am,'' an odd comic turn combining spoken-word passages with a blues-rock refrain. Now skip ahead a few tracks and hear that unmistakable country sound. So what sort of band is this? Why, it's a jazz-blues-swing-R & amp; B-country-western-rock band, of course. And the individual songs on this fun, quirky album are just as tough to categorize. `` I Married Her Just Because She Looks Like You'' comes closest to following a standard country formula, but its wry lyrics are a cut above that standard. `` Good Intentions'' is a sort of talkin' blues number that could easily come from <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromberg </PERSON>'s songbook Then there's `` What Do You Do,'' which starts out as a sassy blues number, turns into a bar-pickup conversation -LRB- <PERSON> Lovett </PERSON> in duet with vocalist <PERSON> Francine </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> -RRB- and slides into the 1936 standard `` The Glory of Love.'' Tying all of this together is <PERSON> Lovett </PERSON>'s peculiar combination of cynicism and romanticism that adds an edge to his I-love-you songs -LRB- `` I Know You Know'' -RRB- and a softness to his she-done-me-wrong songs -LRB- `` Once Is Enough'' -RRB-. This Texan's country roots come out more strongly as the album plays on. The world could do without <PERSON> Lovett </PERSON>'s cover of `` Stand By Your Man,'' but his reworking of the traditional `` Farther Along'' into the lost-love ballad `` If You Were to Wake Up'' has a simple charm. As for the Large Band, it adapts to the needs of each song, appearing in various sizes and combinations of instruments including fiddles, cello and saxophones as well as guitars, keyboards and drums. More than large _ it's grand. _ By <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Wiener Blut'' -LRB- Sire -RRB- _ <PERSON> Falco </PERSON> <PERSON> Falco </PERSON>, the one-time classical music child prodigy who had a No. 1 hit with the unusual `` Rock Me Amadeus'' single in 1986, has returned after a two-year hiatus with `` Wiener Blut.'' The record is chock full of the synthesizer-based pop rock so in vogue today, with its fabricated drums and overblown melodies. But at its base `` Wiener Blut'' rocks solidly, surprisingly. On Side 1, the Austrian-born <PERSON> Falco </PERSON> _ nee <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzel </PERSON> _ collaborates with the <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> brothers <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ferdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, the producer-arranger-composer duo that was responsible for `` Rock Me Amadeus.'' The result is highly orchestral, almost baroque pop _ lush synthesizer lines backed by a heavy dance beat and punctuated by stinging guitar solos. The title cut best typifies this style, while `` Untouchable'' incorporates the television show's theme into the melody and `` Satellite to Satellite,'' with its technology-can-save-us lyrics, combines a spacy synthesizer with a good rock beat. Side 2 leaves the <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> brothers behind. <PERSON> Falco </PERSON> takes charge on most cuts, and the result is a simpler, more satisfying set of tunes with more of a message. `` Walls of Silence,'' the best cut on `` <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> <PERSON> Blut </PERSON>,'' is a slow rocker dealing with the inability of nations to communicate. The wall of the title represents that inability _ probably best symbolized by the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> wall. <PERSON> Falco </PERSON> keeps the beat rocking steady with `` -LRB- She's My -RRB- Solid Booze'' and `` Wie Sand Am <LOCATION> Himalaya </LOCATION>.'' He even checks in with a spirited version of Steely Dan's 1972 hit `` Do It Again'' that features <PERSON> Falco </PERSON>'s best singing on the record. <PERSON> Falco </PERSON> is often silly and vapid. That's too bad, because when he wants to, he makes some pretty fair rock' n' roll. Here's hoping he can stick to the beat. _ By <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> writer

<HEAD>Star Watch: Carmen Maura and Pedro Almodovar Create a Stir</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Impressions of a Spanish film star on her first glimpse of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>: `` I am a little afraid of this city. It is very special. I think it is too much for me. Too much. It is very big, lot of cars. I drive but I do n't want to drive -LRB- here -RRB-. It is impossible to live here without car. Impossible to work.'' It's hard to imagine <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Maura </PERSON> afraid of anything. Her fiery temperament is one of the many delights of `` Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s entry as foreign language film in the Academy Award sweepstakes. The film, the director <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Almodovar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maura </PERSON> have elicited rave reviews from American critics, and the moviegoing public has responded accordingly. The movie has grossed $ 4.6 million, which is big money for a subtitled film these days. `` Women on the Verge'' has been compared to the great screwball comedies of the late 1930s <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maura </PERSON> says she is not surprised that Americans like the film. `` When I started to work with <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> 10 years ago, we had a situation and a relationship that was very special,'' she recalled. `` I said to him, ` Oh, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON>, do n't worry, because in time the Americans will understand you.' `` I am very proud of <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Almodovar </PERSON>. He is very genuine. His sense of humor is very American sometimes, and my sense of humor also. The Spanish have a lot of sense of humor. The directors in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> do n't normally make the kinds of films like <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> makes. They make films about the war, about the poor _ no colors, no rich persons. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> is different.'' The Almodovar-Maura partnership goes back to when he was working for the telephone company in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and she was a mostly unemployed actress. The dark beauty, who speaks in bursts of slightly flawed English, remarked: `` The first moment when I meet <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON>, I am a little actress and he is very young. He had no money; he had nothing. He works with the <ORGANIZATION> Telefonica </ORGANIZATION> and with little parts in the theater. He work with Super-8 -LRB- movies -RRB- and he make jokes every day. `` He has an imagination really, really special. He began to speak to me, and I began to speak to him about life, about women, about men. I say to him, ` <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON>, you must get away from the Super-8 and go to the big film.' So we make the first film during two years on the weekends, without money, without makeup, without nothing. It was a very, very funny movie.'' It was called `` <PERSON> Pepi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Luci </PERSON>, Bom and Other Girls Like Mom,'' a title that set the tone for <PERSON> Almodovar </PERSON>'s film career. Born in a small village of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mancha </LOCATION> in 1951, he had come to <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> at the age of 17, worked at various humdrum jobs while indulging in the burgeoning world of underground literature, pop music and movies. At one time he played in a rock band called <PERSON> Almodovar </PERSON> and <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Maura </PERSON> was born to a conservative <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> family in 1945. After a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> education, she worked in an art gallery while seeking work in theater productions. She met <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> when she was starring in <PERSON> Satre </PERSON>'s `` Dirty Hands,'' and he had a one-line role. After their first movie, she became a TV talk-show hostess on the popular `` Esta Noche'' -LRB- `` Tonight'' -RRB- program. <PERSON> Almodovar </PERSON> first attracted attention outside of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> with his third film, `` Dark Habits,'' in which <PERSON> Maura </PERSON> played a bongo-playing nun. In his other films, she portrayed a harried housewife -LRB- `` What Have I Done to Deserve This?'' -RRB-, a psychiatrist -LRB- `` Matador'' -RRB- and a flamboyant transsexual -LRB- `` Law of Desire'' -RRB-. The director's reputation continued to grow, then he exploded with `` Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' which opened last season's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Film Festival `` It is the first time that a Spanish film has made as much money as an American film,'' <PERSON> Maura </PERSON> said. `` In this case we have the money like ` Rambo,' like <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>. It is the most successful film in the history of the Spanish film. The people see the film three times, four times, and they go with the whole family. They repeat, they laugh a lot. The film is in four cinemas one year. It has a long life in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` I do n't understand exactly what happened with this film. The cinema is a mystery. Sometimes it happens. I do n't understand it.''

<HEAD>The Artists: War's Impact on Iraqi Artists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEIL MacFARQUHAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Murthada </PERSON> <PERSON> Haddad </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s emerging sculptors, spent six years fighting the <LOCATION> Iranians </LOCATION> in the gulf war, and the horrors he and other artists experienced at the front have had a dramatic impact on Iraqi art. `` I saw too many people die in the war and they come out in my work. It was a very, very painful experience,'' said <PERSON> Haddad </PERSON>, who lost his studio and foundry in the southern port of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> when it took a direct hit from Iranian shellfire during fierce assaults on the city. Six months after the August cease-fire, there are few signs of the conflict on the streets of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. But the battle scars are visible in the capital's museums, galleries and studios. Gone are the idyllic landscapes, the bedouins on horseback, the scenes from the marshes and the mountains _ all traditional subjects artists favored before the war began in September 1980. In their place are searing sculptures and paintings that reflect the carnage the artists witnessed. Three sculptures by <PERSON> Haddad </PERSON>, displayed at a recent one-man exhibition, show small, bronze figures sitting twisted and bound, covering their faces. The group is called `` Prisoner of War.'' A statue commemmorating a missile attack was designed by <PERSON> Muhammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghani </PERSON>, whose whimsical statues inspired by the legend of `` 1,001 Nights'' are <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> landmarks. A girl in the statue has two shattered stumps for legs. A painting entitled `` War and Peace,'' which won plastic surgeon <PERSON> Ala </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Bashiir </PERSON> the gold medal at the <ORGANIZATION> Baghdad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>, shows a man leaving the cold, metallic bonds of his military uniform to float among the clouds. `` The war turned the work of most Iraqi artists into art that has something to say, not art for decoration,'' the 50-year-old <PERSON> Bashiir </PERSON> said in an interview. `` They may use the same style, but the subject has changed.'' Painter <PERSON> Shakir </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, 64, remembers his first visit to the front after a fierce battle. `` When I saw <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and the front lines I understood the dramatic results of war. `` When the town itself is burned by bombardment. It means the existence of things is destroyed _ not just humans, but walls, paintings as well.'' One side of his pyramid painting, `` Al-Faw,'' created after the Iraqi army recaptured the strategic southern peninsula in April 1988 after two years of Iranian occupation, is filled with brightly colored triangles and squares. `` I was using the cultural symbols from Arab and Islamic art, like old wall decorations from mosques, to represent the strength of the culture,'' he said. `` Rebuilding them means peace.'' Artists and critics expect more powerful work to emerge once artists in the 1 million-strong army <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> still keeps in the field get back to their easels. `` In the past, the school that was dominant in <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> art was the calligraphy school,'' said prominent critic <PERSON> Jabra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabra </PERSON>. `` With the war, there was a reaction against that. `` The younger artists are very powerful in their statements, using rough colors, a lot of paint, taking a lot of liberty with the canvas. They're trying to say something very personal and very agonized.'' One strong theme that has emerged in the war-influenced art is the enduring legacy of the civilizations that prospered along the <LOCATION> Tigris </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Euphrates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rivers </ORGANIZATION>. Artists said 5,000 years of history in the region was a source of inspiration against the onslaught by <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s army. `` We have an ancient civilization,'' <PERSON> Ghani </PERSON> said. `` Islam is relatively young. It's only been here for the past 1,400 years. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> wanted humanity to go backwards and we did n't want to go backwards.'' <PERSON> Haddad </PERSON> used a group of people inspired by ancient Mespotamian wall reliefs to show the shock induced by the fall of <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. The bearded figures stare off in the distance, mouths agape, hands crossed over their stomachs. Iraqi artists point to the generous checks the government continued handing out during the war as another important wellspring of their work. `` Our public is n't quite like the public in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in that it wants to acquire paintings for prestige,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Jabra </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's coming, but not yet.'' Culture and Information Minister <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Nisayyif </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasim </PERSON> visits most exhibitions, and any artist who has had a one-man show is eligible for government commissions. Everything from the massive new <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> airport to conference rooms at the state oil marketing authority are hung with original artwork. A gold medal at <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s international exhibition carried a $ 15,000 prize. While travel abroad is banned for most Iraqis, artists are allowed to leave to organize exhibitions of their work. The government has realized that giving artists a free hand was an `` indication of the vitality of the nation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Jabra </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Most Iraqi artists are very well-to-do,'' joked <PERSON> Bashiir </PERSON>, who is getting government support to organize a fall showing of his work at the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arabe </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` They earn 10 times more than doctors.'' President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> is known for ruthlessly eliminating his enemies, and the state-run press is heavily censored. Still, artists stress that they have a free hand in their work. But with a limited private market, official tastes tend to dominate and artists generally laud the government's tough standards in selecting the works they commission. Part of the quality comes from the country's highly competitive art colleges. The crude nature of some of the statues emerging from the war has been condemned. In <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, for example, a massive statue on a freeway interchange shows an Iraqi infantryman brandishing a sword after chopping open the neck of a massive `` Iranian shark.'' `` Very few of us are very happy with our public monuments,'' <ORGANIZATION> Jabra </ORGANIZATION> said. However, he added, `` the arts are flourishing. It's miraculous.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Thinking About the Flow of Words</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s new album, `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' has been receiving much critical attention because of its unsparing lyrics about urban blight. He has been asked about lyrical content so much, he wonders why writers do n't go beyond the subject and concern themselves with the poetry in which the lyrics are expressed. `` The opening of ` Romeo Had Juliette' _ ` Caught between the twisted stars the plotted lines the faulty map that brought <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>' _ you've got to admit that's a great opening line,'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> says. `` Forget about what it means and think of the flow of words. I wish people would notice. Do n't you get some kind of pleasure when you listen to the language? `` It's the first song I wrote for the album; it was the standard for the rest. We had the luxury to go in and test out the studio. We tested it with ` <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON>' and kept the cut we did for the record.'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> talked about his music in an interview at the American Sound Studio, where he and a band were rehearsing for a tour that will include an engagement at Broadway's St. James Theater. That's a distance from <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s early, scruffy days in the Velvet Underground. The group was discovered in 1967 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s underground rock scene by the late pop artist, <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>, who promoted them It remained menacingly non-mainstream and did n't become commercial Later, though, it became a role model for punk rock. Working solo since 1970, <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> has had only one pop hit, `` Walk on the Wild Side,'' in 1973. Next November, <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cale </PERSON>, who also left the Velvet Underground in 1970, will present an evening of songs in tribute to <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION>. When he was cutting `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' _ as lyrically street-tough as ever but accepted in these days of rappers and U2 _ <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> was n't expecting media attention `` You can tell from listening we were n't thinking in terms of radio airplay,'' he said. `` Dirty Blvd.'' begins: `` <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> lives out of the Wilshire Hotel. He looks out a window without glass. The walls are made of cardboard newspapers on his feet. His father beats him'cause he's too tired to beg. Sire Records wanted to market a single, but <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said he was n't the type of person to sell singles `` I pushed for ` Dirty Blvd.' because I thought the single should at least be representative of the album. Look what happened,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' is selling better than any previous <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> album, and is fast climbing the charts. A liner note on `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' says, `` You ca n't beat 2 guitars, bass, drum.'' The sound of the record was important to <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, that the words be understandable and the guitars sound real. `` Even though <PERSON> Segovia </PERSON> said an electric guitar is an abomination, what I like about an electric guitar is it can have all this body from the wood in it,'' he said. `` We had as one of our goals to record it so it comes across that way and does n't sound like a synthesizer _ thinned out and high endy. `` One thing was not to have too many instruments. We wanted my solos on guitar to be thick and beautiful. We wanted everything to be heard. Of course, when there's not too many parts, there's nothing to hide behind Any mediocrity is heard.'' His singing is basically talking, and has always been that way. `` In my mind I would like to sing like <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Redding </PERSON> or <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. I ca n't, so I had to find a way I could use my range in my style.'' About the songs, <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said he does n't know why he wrote them. `` I did n't sit and say, ` I'm going to write about this and this.' `` I had pieces of songs. Whatever I get first, I ca n't change,'' he said. `` I can juggle around with later things, but the first phrase or line of melody or title I get for a song, I ca n't change it. I had the title ` Dime Store Mystery' for 20 years. My wife, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON>, said, ` When are you going to finish it?' It came up on this album. `` I like that song a lot. It had an odd effect on us when it was recorded. We were taken someplace else. I ca n't say where that someplace was. `` I guess people do n't expect much out of records. They keep staying on the plot and asking, ` Who do you know in a welfare hotel?' ` Dime Store Mystery' dispenses with plot.'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said what the album is really about is the use of language. `` That's what I'm really getting off on. There are phrases in there as good as anything I've ever written. `` It is pretty funny, some of it, I thought. It's not endlessly grim.'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> took part in a benefit concert <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> organized at Madison Square Garden to buy and equip a medical van to visit <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> welfare hotels. `` <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> bought one with the proceeds of ` Graceland.' Every penny from this concert went to get another one.'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> has been told that `` Last Great American Whale'' from `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' will be on a <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> album released in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. When he's asked if that's a real Indian myth, he says: `` It is now. It's an American Indian-Jewish myth. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> all the great myths have been taken. Would n't it be nice if we could still write a myth and do it well enough so it held up? I wanted to try to do that. Why not?'' Asked about solutions to the big-city problems limned on `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> says, `` We only had an hour. We'll get into solutions on Vol. 2, maybe.''

 It is somehow fitting that when <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellow </PERSON> must choose between an overstuffed chair and a straight-backed one for an interview, he selects the less comfortable seat. `` I write in a chair as hard as this,'' he said with a smile, sitting upright in the rigid seat and looking perfectly at ease. Bellow _ Nobel Prize winner, Pulitzer Prize winner, the only author to win three National Book Awards _ has racked up more than enough laurels on which to comfortably rest, but at 73 he shows no indication he's ready to relax. His 14th book, `` A Theft'' -LRB- Penguin, $ 6.95 -RRB-, is now in bookstores. This reluctance to get too comfortable is all a part of what <PERSON> Bellow </PERSON> calls `` fighting the Nobel curse'' _ the popular conception that writers produce little work of merit after winning the granddaddy of all literature prizes. Since receiving the Nobel in 1976, he has published the following: two novels, `` The Dean's December'' and `` More Die of Heartbreak''; a collection, `` Him With His Foot in His Mouth and Other Stories''; and the latest work, a novella. Although most critics rank these works below such masterpieces as `` The Adventures of Augie March,'' `` Mr. <PERSON> Sammler </PERSON>'s Planet'' and `` Humboldt's Gift,'' they are by no means considered second-rate, and the new `` A Theft'' shows <PERSON> Bellow </PERSON> still willing to take risks. `` A Theft'' breaks ground on two levels. It is his first long work to have a female protagonist, and it is the first time an author of <PERSON> Bellow </PERSON>'s stature has opted to publish a book in paperback without it first appearing in hardcover. Bellow is a small man with an unassuming manner and low voice that contrast nicely with his August reputation. At an interview in the drawing room of the private <ORGANIZATION> Lotos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, he answered questions thoughtfully but with little hesitation, as if he had already considered them. The snowy hair, aristocratic nose and space between the front teeth are familiar from book jackets; what is unexpected is a tiredness about the eyes that may be old age or simply that he had risen early enough to appear on a morning talk show that day. His novella's heroine is <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> <PERSON> Velde </PERSON>, a middle-aged publishing executive dubbed the `` czarina of fashion writing.'' For all her sophistication and Park Avenue polish, <PERSON> Clara </PERSON>, we quickly learn, has never forgotten her small-town <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> roots and her strict Protestant upbringing. Nor has she forgotten her first love, <PERSON> Ithiel </PERSON> <PERSON> Regler </PERSON>, a kind of free-lance global political analyst who appears regularly before congressional committees and on network news programs. <PERSON> Clara </PERSON>'s four husbands ca n't hold a candle to him. An emerald engagement ring Ithiel once gave her is the subject of the book's title. <PERSON> Bellow </PERSON> dismissed the critical fuss over his use of a female protagonist as so much topical ferment and pointed out that many of his short stories have been about women. `` It just struck me forcibly, so I did it. There was no planning about it, no public policy involved,'' he said. `` I wrote it the way I write everything.'' <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> is described in the opening paragraph as an energetic woman with `` a head unusually big. ... Her blue eyes, exceptionally large, grew prominent when she brooded. The nose was small _ ancestrally a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> nose.'' Such exacting descriptions of characters' features is a Bellow trademark. A minor character in `` Augie March'' has `` a campaigner's red in the face, a powerful bite in his jaw and gold-crowned teeth, green cockeyes and soft short hair, altogether Napoleonic.'' <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON>, the protagonist of `` Seize the Day'' has `` a big round face, a wide, flourishing red mouth, stump teeth.'' `` It's a lifelong thing for me,'' <PERSON> Bellow </PERSON> said of his fascination with faces. `` As soon as I meet somebody it just comes over me. I've never finished with that. Certainly children do that immediately. Before you have any concept of what it means you have very powerful impressions of who people are, secret communications, by the way their ears stand out on their heads, their grimaces. A nose can tell you volumes.'' He is asked if he considers the impetuous <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> a romantic, as so many of his characters are. `` I do n't know whether she's a romantic character or a passionate character; the two have become somewhat confused these days. I do think of her as a very passionate person. I also think of her as having an intelligence and force,'' said <PERSON> Bellow </PERSON>, who like many writers speaks of his characters as if they were acquaintances rather than products of his imagination. `` Well, it's often like that,'' he said when this is pointed out to him. `` Are these people outright inventions? Well, sometimes they are. But they're never what they were originally. ... It's the imagination poured into the person that makes them worth reading about.'' Bellow is most firmly associated with <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where he has lived most of his life since he arrived with his family from <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, when he was 9. The city, from its Depression-era slums to its modern North Shore high-rises, is the setting of most of his fiction. However, `` A Theft,'' like a few other works, takes place in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where he lived for a time early in his writing career. <PERSON> Bellow </PERSON> said the debut of `` A Theft'' as a paperback original is his way of protesting what he considers the third-class treatment given fiction in magazines these days, where short stories are increasingly scarce to make room for more articles on sex, politics, sports, entertainment and other `` distractions.'' `` Literature is anti-distraction,'' he said. `` It is absorption and forgetfulness.'' When two magazines rejected `` A Theft'' as being too long to publish, <PERSON> Bellow </PERSON> began casting about for another way to get it into print. He said he probably had enough weight to persuade a publisher to put out the manuscript in hardcover, but he did n't want a reader to have to spend $ 15 or more for a work that ran barely 100 pages His agent peddled it to <PERSON> Penguin </PERSON>, and the result is a book with a 150,000 first printing that will see a far larger audience than it would have in a magazine. <PERSON> Bellow </PERSON> will publish another novella this fall in the same format and hopes his move will inspire other authors to dig similar manuscripts out of desk drawers. He is at work on a third novella. `` Lately, it's strongly appealed to me,'' he said of the form, `` maybe because of my age. There's a certain number of things I want to write, and I do n't want to invest many years in writing them at great length. I also have a feeling that a great many people today also want things to be more compressed.'' With a self-deprecating laugh, <PERSON> Bellow </PERSON> offered up this assessment of his work: `` A great many people seem to view me as a very good writer who is very difficult to read.'' A wry observation from a man who selects the hard chair over the soft one _ whose fans do no less, recognizing that less substantial writers are too cushy to provide support over the long haul.

<TEXT>
 Singer <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> is working on a streak of four straight No. 1 country music records. But the biggest song with which he's been associated was one he wrote that took nine years to become a hit and then became a country classic: `` Thank God for Kids,'' recorded by the Oak Ridge Boys. The 44-year-old Raven is at the peak of a 20-year recording career. His ``'Till You Cry'' recently reached No. 1 on at least one of the national country charts, joining his earlier top ranked `` <PERSON> Shine </PERSON> <PERSON> Shine </PERSON> <PERSON> Shine </PERSON>,'' `` I'm Gon na Get You'' and `` Joe Knows How to Live.'' Since October 1987, each of his singles has been No. 1. His first No. 1 record was `` I Got Mexico'' in 1984. Several other songs of his have been close to the top spot. But it was the emotional lyrics of `` Thank God for Kids'' that probably will make it the most enduring song of his prolific singing and songwriting career. The impassioned tune sold 1 million copies for the <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> in five weeks in 1982, and has become the theme song for various anti-child abuse campaigns in the seven years since. `` There's stone reality in that song,'' <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Everybody who's had kids has had KoolAid on the couch. Every father has tried to fly a kite. And kids ask thousands of questions.'' He composed the song at home in 15 minutes in 1973, inspired by his 3-year-old son, who said he wanted to help his father write about <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> and Big Bird. <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> himself recorded the song in 1976 but only as the B-side of a record. Music industry executives told him the subject matter just was n't what country music fans wanted. `` I was told country folks do n't care about <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> and Christmas, that they are interested in love and barrooms,'' <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said. `` I tried for three years to get that song put out. They said no.'' Finally, the song reached the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> who made it a hit and one of their most requested tunes. As a singer, he recently released the album `` Best of <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Raven </PERSON>,'' his top selling LP to date. Due out by summer on the new Universal label is another album, `` Temporary Sanity.'' `` We wanted the title to at least stir some excitement from people: ` What has he done now?''' <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said about the intriguing title. He has a deep, masculine voice that pours out incisive songs in a style he describes as `` Cajun reggae, <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cajun </LOCATION>, electric Cajun.'' `` No one is doing exactly what we're doing,'' he said about his style. `` Someone asked me why I do n't do more hard country like <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>. I said, ` Why? They do it great and I ca n't do it any better than that.' `` I want to break some new ground and bring the <LOCATION> Cajun </LOCATION> heritage a step farther and a little step up if we can.'' <PERSON> Raven </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, was the oldest of 10 children born to a truck driver. He began performing and writing in his early teens, but has worked in the cotton and rice fields, as a service station attendant and in a lumberyard. He even `` ran moonshine'' for a while. His first album came out in 1969, making this his 20th year as a recording artist. He said his streak of No. 1 records has made him more aggressive. `` They make you fight harder to make a better product. If you are honest and realize how fleeting they are and how fortunate you are, it makes you work harder to find that better song and change that one lyric to make it better. `` It also gives you a little more to show for what you've done. You hang up a No. 1 plaque before you hang up a No. 3 plaque.'' He attributed part of his recent success to being hard-headed: `` I've always been stubborn. When people made a suggestion, I always asked why instead of saying OK. But I got a little more adamant about it. I really analyzed everything a little better. `` I had more expertise. I worked a little bit more. I'm able to draw on a lot more road experience and more of what the public is listening to.''

 <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Biggins </PERSON> never gave up on oats. Even when prices were low and other farmers thought about switching, <PERSON> Biggins </PERSON> stuck with oats. `` Oats is a great crop.'' `` It does n't need the chemicals or the work that a row crop does. It's nice to be able to have a straw crop to rotate. All this about oats being good for cholesterol is going to do a lot of good for the oats industry.'' `` All this'' is the fact that oat bran, the husk of the kernel, can help reduce cholesterol and prevent heart attacks. So far, though, it's been cereal makers and consumers who have reaped the benefits; farmers are suffering. The nation raised more oats under <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> than under <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's kind of ironic that production has been declining while the demand ... is increasing.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oat production plummeted by 42 percent last year to 219 million bushels, the smallest crop on record. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, the leading oat state in 1987, production dropped 62 percent last year to 20 million bushels. The summer's drought was one factor, but farmers say government programs that favored other crops also were to blame. `` It's a real shame. There just has not been any money in oats. You have to get paid for something to want to grow it,'' said <PERSON> Biggins </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>. `` The prices got so bad, I just felt like I had been betrayed,'' said <PERSON> Milt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lakness </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Hayti </LOCATION>. `` I'm a fan of the oat. I was tickled to think I was raising something that was going into Americans' breakfasts. Some farmers are skeptical about the oat revival, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON>, an oat researcher at <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's a lot of hesitation to get back into oats. You'd think they'd be clamoring to get back in now.'' <PERSON> Lakness </PERSON> said he's heard about the oat-bran craze, and is eating more oatmeal himself these days to lower his cholesterol level. But he's not ready to stake his financial future on the hope of a resurgence. `` I'll plant oats this year, but I'm not going to plant very much,'' he said. `` They talk about all this interest in oats, but if you could make more money on other crops, would you plant oats? The arithmetic is just not there.'' Lawmakers have n't tried to encourage production because, until recently, no one really cared about oats, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said. `` Since the public was n't eating them, it did n't make that much difference.'' That may be changing. A provision of last year's drought bill gave farmers more freedom to plant oats. `` We were trying to level out the playing field for oats,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, an aide to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, D-S. Another measure introduced by <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.D. </LOCATION>, would give farmers more flexibility and would raise the government-guaranteed price, eliminating what <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON> called `` distortions in agriculture programs that discourage oats production.'' <PERSON> Deon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuthman </PERSON>, an oat researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Improvement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, thinks <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may go even further. `` People in a lot of different areas are embarrassed that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be importing 70 million bushels of oats this year,'' he said. Imports are another reason farmers should n't count on a boom, <PERSON> Lakness </PERSON> said. `` We farmers in this part of the state raise the finest oats of anyplace in the nation. Then the oat people decide they can get a better deal somewhere else.''

<HEAD>Newly Discovered Flower Gets Sex Backward</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Botanists thought they had plant sex figured out. After all, all 248,000 known flowering plants had the pistil _ the female parts _ in the center, and the stamen _ the male parts _ outside. But biologist <PERSON> Esteban </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, tromping through three feet of decaying tropical muck in a chigger-ridden jungle, has proved once again that little can be taken for granted in science. Lacandonia schismatica, a flower the size of a sesame seed, has the stamen in the center, surrounded by about 50 pistils. `` It defies all logic,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, head of research at the Missouri Botanical Garden in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. He said a paper on the discovery will appear in an upcoming issue of Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who works at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>, found the star-shaped flower on a fallen tree trunk in the Lacandon jungle. At first he thought he'd picked up a type of mushroom, and it took a year to discover and prove it was an exception to the sexual rule. `` It seems to be some sort of massive mutation. One of the sacred things has been that the female parts are inside the male,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. More study is needed to see what advantage a reverse arrangement could have. The plant appears to reproduce as other flowering plants do: pollen from the stamen fertilizes the ovaries, which are part of the pistils. The ovaries turn into fruit, which produce seeds. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> agreed to discuss the discovery before publication because they believe the plant's habitat is threatened by logging. Cutting was banned last year in the 20-acre site where the plant has been found, but <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said he'd heard that members of the <PERSON> Chol </PERSON> <PERSON> Indian </PERSON> tribe are seeking permission to cut chicle trees, valued because their wood resists rot. The reserve is in <LOCATION> Chiapas </LOCATION> state near the Guatemalan border. `` We've advised all the authorities in <LOCATION> Chiapas </LOCATION> and the federal Ecology Department, and we hope they take the proper measures,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. Each plant has four to seven flowers 2 millimeters in diameter, growing along threadlike stems up to 3 -LCB- inches long. The flowers have six tepals _ a kind of petal _ ending in turned-up points. They are thickish, something like the fleshy leaves of a jade plant. In the center is a mound of ovaries encircling an average of three stamen. The plant is a brilliant, almost translucent white, `` like crystal,'' <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said. As the ovaries mature, the center turns yellow, then to the reddish-brown color of its fruit, so tiny they're like a fine dust. Lacking chlorophyll, the plant gets its energy from decomposing material in the dark, humid jungle with the help of a fungus that lives in its roots. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> believe the plant does n't belong to any existing family and propose that it be categorized as family Lacandoniaceae, genus <LOCATION> Lacandonia </LOCATION> and species schismatica, for the jungle and the fact that it broke with traditional botanical faith. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said the plant is clearly a new genus and species, but he expects it to fall into the existing family of Triuridaceae _ which includes varieties of flowering plants with normally arranged sexual parts. When he spotted the plant in September 1985, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was collecting for <PERSON> Flora </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesoamericana </PERSON>, a survey run by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the Missouri Botanical Garden and the Natural History Museum in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He has been unable to find the plant in other parts of the jungle, but <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> thinks it will appear. `` My experience is that plants do n't have ranges that restricted,'' he said. The plant has survived for as long as six weeks in the laboratory, but it then dies, perhaps because it does n't fertilize itself and may need insects to carry its pollen to another plant's pistils

<HEAD>An Apple a Day Might Make the Doctor Sick</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An apple a day really might keep the doctor away _ especially if the doctor knew what went on it. If fruit were labele the label on apples would list fiber, potassium and vitamin C _ all of which are good for you. It also might list azinphis methyl, Captan, Supracide, parathion, <PERSON> Elgetol </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sevin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NAA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NAD </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ziram </PERSON>, diphenylamine, <LOCATION> Lorsban </LOCATION> and benzimidazole. These might not be so good, but they're among the dozens of chemicals routinely used to bring apples from fruit trees to fruit bowls. Without some of them, according to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> apple grower <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, `` People would have to get used to biting into an apple and seeing a whole or half a worm.'' Probably the best-known of these chemicals right now is Alar, the market name for daminozide, which helps apples ripen, extends shelf life and prevents bruising. Many schools pulled apples from their lunchrooms this month after the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Res </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said Alar increased the risk of cancer among children, whose diet contains proportionally more fruit than adults. Most schools let apples back in after the claim was disputed by regulators, <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the industry, which cut its use of Alar to 5 percent of the $ 1.2 billion-a-year crop since concerns were first raised in 1985. But dozens of other chemicals are routinely used, and the <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> considers several of them to be cancer-causing even though, like Alar, they are legal. A recent <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> Poll found that 84.2 percent of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> would choose organically grown food if given the choice. But <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said that without the chemicals, an apple `` would be a rather small, gnarled -LRB- object -RRB- that kind of resembled an apple. It would be covered with a black fungus scab, infested with various decay molds which could have natural carcinogens. It would undoubtedly have codling bud moths and other types of larvae.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s 5,000 growers, who produce about half the nation's apples, spend an average $ 449 per acre to buy and apply chemicals each year, said <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> tree fruit extension agent Many of the chemicals have been identified as harmful to childen by the <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> report, which studied chemical residues on food. But those findings are in dispute, and the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> and Surgeon General have all said apples are safe. Here is a typical chemical season for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> apples: In early April, before bloom, an organophosphate spray _ Supracide, <LOCATION> Lorsban </LOCATION> or parathion _ kills the eggs of European red mites and also controls the spread of <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scale </ORGANIZATION>, a pest which can kill trees. In May, growers will apply Guthion, the marketing name for azinphis methyl, an insecticide that kills the codling moth larva, which produces worms in apples and is the most damaging pest in the orchard. Also applied at bloom time is <PERSON> Elgetol </PERSON>, a `` thinner'' that burns off some of the flowers, reducing the number of apples a tree will bear. Untreated trees will produce huge crops one year and tiny ones the next to conserve energy. Another thinner is <PERSON> Sevin </PERSON>, an insecticide made from the chemical carbarylaced Alar as a `` stop-drop,'' which farmers would spray about a month after bloom to keep apples on trees; an apple on the ground is worthless. <ORGANIZATION> NAA </ORGANIZATION> and NAD are less effective, and there is no substitute for Alar's ability to extend shelf life, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. Ziram or Captan, fungicides used to battle bull's eye rot, also are applied at this time. In warehouses, the apples are rinsed, washed with detergent, rinsed again, sometimes waxed, dried and placed in boxes for shipment. Those destined for storage for three months to a year might be treated with two chemicals. One is benzimidazole, a fungicide; the other is diphenylamine, which prevents the red skin from turning brown.

Two daily tablespoons of lecithin, a common health-food staple, could help. `` The medical community accepts that there may be a role for lecithin in aiding memory,'' said neurologist <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Neuromedical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baumel </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Safford </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> social work professor, studied the effects of lecithin last year. In their study, 41 subjects aged 50 to 80 were given two tablespoons a day of lecithin for four weeks and 20 others received placebos. They kept logs of memory-loss incidents the seven days before and after taking the substance. Ninety percent of the lecithin group had a significant decrease in memory lapses, <PERSON> Safford </PERSON> said. The placebo group had 60 percent more such lapses, though that may have resulted from increased awareness because of keeping track. In addition, 40 percent of lecithin takers `` reported an improvement in mood, a decrease in anxiety and a general sense of well being,'' she said. None of the placebo takers reported any change in mood. The study was limited to people with mild memory loss, not those with the severe symptoms or Alzheimer's disease, for whom lecithin already has failed to show significant results, Ms. <PERSON> Safford </PERSON> said. Lecithin contains lots of B vitamins, particularly one called choline, known to improve the work of neurotransmitters _ brain cells that fire electric charges that make our thought processes work. `` By adding choline to the diet, you are helping this brain mechanism to fire faster,'' Ms. <PERSON> Safford </PERSON> said. `` There may not be dramatic changes. We're not looking at people suddenly becoming geniuses. But even if it helps a little bit, we should try it.'' But choline needs to pass the blood-brain barrier, which keeps harmful chemicals from damaging the brain. Lecithin, which is similar to chemicals in the brain, turns out to be an ideal transporter. `` It has an emulsifier that allows it to pass through the blood-brain barrier,'' <PERSON> Safford </PERSON> said. The lecithin is taken in granule form, mixed with a liquid like fruit juice or sprinkled on cereal, rather than in capsules, she said. `` You'd have to take 16 to 20 capsules a day to equal the same amount as a tablespoon.'' The only reported ill effect from lecithin was mild diarrhea.

<HEAD>Oat Bran Craze Shows No Signs of Tapering Off, Cereal Makers Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nothing helps scenery like ham and eggs, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> once remarked, but health-conscious Americans are choosing a bowl of oat bran instead to brighten up their breakfast horizons. Consumer craving for the husk of the oat kernel has opened up a whole new landscape for cereal makers and bakers, while critics charge that greedy food companies are unscrupulously capitalizing on the consumer craze. Almost 1 -LCB- years have passed since the oat-bran boom began, ignited by scientific studies indicating that just over an ounce of oat bran eaten daily as part of a low-fat diet could help prevent heart attacks. <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest oat miller and maker of oat bran cereal, is turning out a million pounds of oat bran a month, compared with a million a year two years ago, and is introducing a cold oat bran cereal. Meanwhile, competitors are jumping on the bran wagon, including <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Parsippany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ralston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Oat bran is going into everything from pancakes to potato chips The magic of oat bran is that it is one of the best known sources of soluble fiber, which reduces cholesterol in the blood and along with it risk of heart disease. Beans like pinto, kidney and navy; psyllium, a seed grain; rice bran; and fruits with pectin, like apples and grapefruit, are good sources. One of the most important studies of oat bran found that people with normal blood cholesterol levels who went on a low-fat diet reduced their cholesterol levels by about 5 percent. But if their diets included 2 ounces of oat bran or oat meal, the cholesterol levels dropped 8 percent to 9 percent. Every 1 percent decline in blood cholesterol is believed to result in a 1 percent to 2 percent reduction in heart attack risk, said dietitian <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, who led the study at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. As little as 34 grams of oat bran _ a little more than an ounce _ have been found to produce the cholesterol-lowering effect in scientific studies. But that knowledge may be of little help to consumers facing torrents of advertising hype and a jungle of new oat-bran products. It can take more than a dozen servings a day of some foods to see benefits, and some products are full of highly saturated fats that may drive up blood-cholesterol levels more than the oat bran lowers them. `` Check the label,'' nutritionists warn.

<HEAD>Newly Discovered Flower Gets Sex Backward</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Botanists thought they had plant sex figured out. After all, all 248,000 known flowering plants had the pistil _ the female parts _ in the center and the stamen _ the male parts _ outside. Biologist <PERSON> Esteban </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> found a plant that proved little can be taken for granted in science. Lacandonia schismatica, a flower the size of a sesame seed, has the stamen in the center, surrounded by about 50 pistils. More study is needed to see what advantage the reversal could have. The plant appears to reproduce as others do: pollen from the stamen fertilizes the ovaries, which turn into fruit. `` It defies all logic,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, head of research at the Missouri Botanical Garden in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. A paper on the discovery will appear in an upcoming issue of Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden. The plant is a brilliant, almost translucent white, `` like crystal,'' said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>' colleague, <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>. As the ovaries mature, the center turns yellow, then the reddish-brown of its fruit, so tiny they're like a fine dust. Lacking chlorophyll, the plant gets its energy from decomposing material in the dark, humid jungle with the help of a fungus that lives in its roots.

 If fruit were labeled with ingredients, the label on apples would list fiber, potassium and vitamin C _ which are good for you. It also might list azinphis methyl, Captan, Supracide, parathion, <PERSON> Elgetol </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sevin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NAA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NAD </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ziram </PERSON>, diphenylamine, <LOCATION> Lorsban </LOCATION> and benzimidazole. These might not be so good, but they're among dozens of chemicals routinely used to bring apples from fruit trees to fruit bowls. Many have been identified by the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> as harmful to childen, based on chemical residues on food. But those findings are in dispute, and federal regulators and the industry say apples are safe. Here is a typical chemical season for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> apples: In early April, an organophosphate spray _ Supracide, <LOCATION> Lorsban </LOCATION> or parathion _ kills the eggs of European red mites and also controls the spread of <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scale </ORGANIZATION>, a pest which can kill trees. In May, Guthion, the marketing name for azinphis methyl, kills codling the moth larva, the most damaging pest in the orchard. Also applied at bloom time is <PERSON> Elgetol </PERSON>, a `` thinner'' that burns off some flowers, reducing the number of apples a tree will bear. Untreated trees will produce huge crops one year and tiny ones the next to conserve energy. Another thinner is <PERSON> Sevin </PERSON>, an insecticide made from the chemical carbaryl. <ORGANIZATION> NAA </ORGANIZATION> and NAD have largely replaced Alar to keep apples on trees longer. They are less effective, and there is no substitute for Alar's ability to extend shelf life. Ziram or Captan, fungicides used to battle bull's eye rot, also are applied at this time.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Climbing Stairs Not Good Exercise For Fatties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fat people should n't climb stairs for exercise because it can put dangerous stress on their hearts, a physician says. `` Stair climbing is excellent exercise for individuals who are not overweight. However, stair climbing is not the best way for overweight people to lose weight,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Marque </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> pulmonary specialist who tested 20 men at or near their ideal weight and 10 who were 30 percent overweight on a miniature `` escalator'' sold for exercise. `` An overweight person must perform an excessive amount of work to climb stairs even at a modest pace,'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> recently told the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION> for Experimental Biology. The men were tested at 40, 50, 60 and 70 steps a minute for five minutes at each speed, going without a rest from one speed to the next. Heart rates and oxygen consumption were measured throughout. Fifty steps a minute is about normal climbing speed, but only three of the fat men managed to get past 40 steps a minute, <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said. `` Seven of the 10 reached exhaustion in three or four minutes at the lowest speed. The other three reached exhaustion in the next five minutes.'' Nearly all of the other group got to 60 or 70 steps a minund of a nut and a bolt. You sew on the nut part into the front of the eye, then screw the bolt in through this supporting structure,'' said <PERSON> Barron </PERSON>. One major problem, is that rejection sets in faster than many other sorts of plastic implants, he said. `` It's different than an artificial heart valve or an artificial hip, where it's totally enclosed. For the patient to see, it has to protrude partly out. And the body tries to extrude it.'' Patients must use an antibiotic ointment on the lens and eyelid at night, with a pad to protect the lens and `` close'' the eye for sleep. In the morning, they clean it off with hydrogen peroxide on a cotton swab. Some implants can last for years, but complications usually set in after a year or two.

<NOTE>Doctor Claims First Test For Premenstrual Syndrome</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A gynecologist says he's developed a test to detect whether moodiness is a result of premenstrual syndrome, but others say his work is promising although the sample is too small to be conclusive. Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Portman </PERSON>, whose clinic in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, specializes in PMS and menopausal care, told the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Experimental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biology </ORGANIZATION> that he has found low levels of the antibody for leuteinizing hormone _ the hormone controlling ovulation _ among PMS sufferers. <PERSON> Portman </PERSON> said his is the first biological test for PMS, which is estimated to affect anywhere from one-tenth to half of all women. `` It would be wonderful if we had a test like that,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Branning </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> gynecologist. A test would help doctors convince women whose depression was not due to PMS that they needed to try other treatment. She and gynecologist <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Portman </PERSON>'s sample _ 456 women with <ORGANIZATION> PMS </ORGANIZATION> and 65 symptom-free controls _ was too small for conclusive results. `` PMS is such a very diffuse problem, it's hard to deal with. It has such protean manifestations,'' said <PERSON> Branning </PERSON>. `` I think you aways wonder if it's not more than one thing that we've lumped together under one heading.'' Symptoms include depression, distorted thinking, angry outbursts, headache, food binges and bloating in the weeks between ovulation and menstruation. Without a test, <PERSON> Portman </PERSON> said, doctors must see whether a woman's symptoms fit PMS and ask her to chart them against her period for several months `` We are at the very embryonic stage of what we have,'' said <PERSON> Portman </PERSON>. `` We have a high and statistic significant correlation of antibody levels and PMS. Hopefully, over the next few years we can unravel more of this.''

But when it comes to spending that money, consumers have been showing more restraint.

The 11th <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> had asked the judge for a decision on the issue, which is central to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s legal efforts to end the 3-week-old walkout. `` As I see it, I need to make a determination whether refusal to cross the picket line is a ` pretext,''' the judge said today. `` I must determine what the appeals court means about ` pretext.''' <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Linsey </PERSON> asked for Thursday's hearing during the judge's meeting with lawyers. `` We do n't think that Eastern has shown in the previous hearings that <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>'s action was a pretext,'' <PERSON> Linsey </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> claims the Railway Labor Act gives its members the right to show sympathy for the striking Machinists. The appeals court agreed, but added that `` a claim of a sympathy strike can not be used as a pretext to shield conduct that otherwise would be a clear violation of the Railway Labor Act.'' Eastern lawyer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said today that the judge already had enough evidence, unsuccessfully arguing for <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> to immediately forward to the appeals judges the finding that the pilots' walkout was not allowed. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said the first six-week training class for about 40 replacement pilots was beginning today with an organizational session. All but 200 of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 3,600 pilots have refused to work since the strike began March 4. `` I have heard that they're even coming from other airlines,'' <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said of the new pilots. `` They're coming over because they can make seniority faster.'' Eastern has been operating only about 10 percent of its daily pre-strike schedule of 1,040 flights, concentrating on routes from the airline's <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> hub to the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, which were the most heavily traveled on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s past, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON>. The pilots union continued to play down <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to hire replacement pilots, saying there simply are n't enough pilots to fill available airline slots, especially at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which are operated by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Young pilots know better than to go to work for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>,'' said Capt <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Saux </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilot and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>'s education committee. <PERSON> Saux </PERSON> said in a news release that he and other <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> members have been meeting with pilots from regional airlines and corporations as well as student pilots.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said today it has retained two investment banking firms to explore ways to increase the value of its stock, including selling or recapitalizing the company.

 The stock market showed some spotty gains in slow trading today against a background of confusion about the economic outlook. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.85 to 2,250.89 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.

 Crude oil futures opened sharply higher today in a rally oil traders and analysts predicted would result from last week's closing of an Alaskan harbor to contain a massive oil spill. The Valdez, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, harbor was closed Friday after 240,000 barrels of oil spilled from an <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> oil tanker that ran aground on a reef south of the port city. It is being called the largest oil spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> is the only terminal that handles crude oil produced on the North Slope of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, the source of more than 25 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production. The volume of Alaskan crude that has been temporarily disrupted is more than 3 -LCB- times the amount of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> production shut down during recent months because of a series of accidents. The May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, was up 57 cents from Thursday's close at $ 20.72 per 42-gallon barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodity markets were closed Friday for the Good Friday holiday. Refined products traded on the exchange also rose sharply. April unleaded gasoline was 59.95 cents per gallon, up 1.93 cents from Thursday's close, and heating oil was 57.70 cents a gallon, up 1.18 cents from Thursday. Most Alaskan crude goes to West coast refineries, which will be scambling for supplies, said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, senior vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He expects prices to move higher immediately and to climb sharply if the harbor remains closed past the middle of the week. `` If it is down all next week, it is going to drive prices up quite a bit. There is nothing else available to take the place of <ORGANIZATION> Alaskan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Slope </ORGANIZATION> crude for those <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> refineries,'' <PERSON> Willson </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has not indicated how long the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> harbor will be closed, but no ships will be allowed to leave until all remaining oil has been pumped out of the Exxon tanker, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratterman </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the operator of the <ORGANIZATION> TransAlaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> and the Valdez terminal. The 987-foot tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>, carrying 1.2 million barrels of North Slope crude, ran onto a reef 25 miles from port early Friday after swinging out of a traffic lane to avoid ice. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> is at the southern end of the 800-mile <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil pipeline.

 Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly lower in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to forecasts for rain in some of the nation's major crop areas. The corn and soybean markets registered the sharpest early losses amid predictions for thunderstorms in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> during the next few days and above-average precipitation in the region next week. The central and southern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> also were expected to receive rain tonight and Tuesday, which would help the maturing winter wheat crop. There was little news of export business in the market this morning. `` With a lot of the world not working today because of people still celebrating the Easter holiday, there's not much here in the way of demand,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Prices likely will be influenced this week by position-evening ahead of Friday's <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report on quarterly grain stocks and spring planting intentions, analysts said. In early trading, wheat was -RCB- cent lower to -RCB- cent higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 4.29 a bushel; corn was 1 \ cents to 2 \ cents lower with May at $ 2.75 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -RCB- cents to 3 \ cents lower with May at $ 2.02 a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 4 \ cents lower with May at $ 7.81 Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were mostly lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .08 cent higher with April at 78.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .32 cent lower to .23 cent higher with April at 81.25 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent to .33 cent lower with April at 42.37 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .10 cent to .48 cent lower with May at 37.67 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Thursday. The commodity markets were closed on Friday.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' largest banking companies, today announced it would seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code, in response to involuntary bankruptcy petitions filed against it. The troubled bank holding company, which last fall stopped making interest and principal payments on about $ 470 million of debt while it attempted to recapitalize, said three noteholders last week filed a bankruptcy court petition in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> seeking to have <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> involuntarily sold off to pay creditor claims. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCane </PERSON> said the company learned Friday about the filings for the involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation. `` MCorp deeply regrets that those noteholders ignored our pleas not to take premature and unnecessary action,'' <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, said in a prepared statement. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said he hoped the action by a very small number of noteholders seeking to force liquidation of <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> would not disrupt or interfere with discussions between prospective investors and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on terms of a recapitalization plan. Under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law, <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> would be protected from creditor claims while it reorganizes under bankruptcy court supervision and works out a plan to pay debts. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s Chapter 11 filing would supercede the Chapter 7 petition, which calls for the total sale of the company to satisfy creditors. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> McCane </PERSON> said the company has not yet indicated when it would ask the bankruptcy court to convert the involuntary liquidation request to a Chapter 11 reorganization case. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> has 20 days to convert the petitions once the company is served with them. The company's individual MBanks are n't involved, and the filings should not affect the company's business, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said. `` We want all of the depositors, customers, employees and suppliers of MBanks to know that our 86 offices will remain open for business as usual,'' <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said. Since last fall, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> representatives have met several times with noteholders and urged them not to take action prematurely despite the moratorium on payment of principal and interst on borrowed money while the company proceeded with efforts to recapitalize. The Wall Street Journal identified the three creditors who filed the Chapter 7 petitions as S.N. <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, bond broker that claims to hold $ 2 million principal amount in <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> debentures; and <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eberhardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, each of whom claims to hold $ 5,000 in debentures. <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bader </PERSON>, an attorney for the holders, told the Journal his clients decided to file for Chapter 7 liquidation for fear that <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> would be forced to pump its holding company assets into the failing MBanks, thereby putting the money out of reach of creditors. The Journal quoted analysts as saying <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s move complicates the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to arrange a sale of MCorp. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> had set an April 3 deadline for bids to acquire <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> has the authority to sell or otherwise dispose of insolvent banks once they have been closed by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Comptroller of the Currency, but a bankruptcy filing would make any plan to sell the company subject to a bankruptcy judge's approval. <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> records show that 25 banks owned by <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> posted a $ 213 million fourth-quarter loss and lost $ 903 million in 1988.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is pondering a $ 1.68 billion offer to take the company private as well as a restructuring plan by senior management that would keep it publicly traded. `` No determination has been made to sell the company or engage in any other transaction,'' the hospital company said in a statement, adding that it appointed a committee of six outside directors to evaluate the proposals. Both proposals were revealed Sunday. The $ 1.68 billion debt-financed takeover plan, proposed by minority shareholder Dr. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and and an investment group, offers $ 24 a share for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> stock, including $ 20 to $ 22 in cash and the remainder in securities. Under this offer, the buyers also would assume some $ 1.4 billion in long-term debt. <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>, who already owns nearly 10 percent of the company's 70 million shares, is making the offer with <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION>, a private Los Angeles investment firm. It is unrelated to <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the investment firm controlled by <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> also said it is pondering a restructuring proposal, which it did n't describe in detail. That proposal, developed by an unidentified investment banking firm and senior managers, would keep the company in public hands, and `` could provide over a six - to nine-month period total shareholder value of between $ 25 and $ 29 per share, including a special cash divided,'' the company said The company said its recently named chairman and chief executive, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilleland </PERSON>, is officially neutral on the two proposals, which were presented to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION>'s board on Thursday. The company has been subject to takeover speculation because of disappointing earnings and the depressed value of its shares, which reportedly led to last summer's forced resignation of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisman </PERSON> as chief executive.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers gather this week to review a recently-strengthened world oil market and the impact of the cartel's strategy for cutting production to help boost crude prices. Eight ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> were scheduled to begin talks Wednesday at cartel headquarters in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, secretary-general of the 13-nation organization, told reporters last week that the ministers _ members of a monitoring committee _ would review the market and make certain the new accord was working well. The cartel agreed last November on a new quota system limiting each member's output in the first half of this year in an attempt to support a price of $ 18 a barrel. The overall production level was set at 18.5 million barrels a day, well under the actual output at year's end. Many analysts had been skeptical the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> countries would comply with their quotas, but now say most nations generally have met their targets. `` They've done better adhering to -LRB- their quotas -RRB- than most had expected,'' said <PERSON> Fergus </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON>, oil analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wedd </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` Prices have looked amazingly good,'' he said. The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> reaching $ 17.50 a barrel last week, up more than $ 5 from late November when the output deal was struck. In <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> futures trading, the May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, was up 45 cents at $ 20.60 a barrel Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Although Monday's price was inflated by speculation stemming from the closing of the Alaskan pipeline at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> due to a major offshore oil spill, it still reflected the crude's sharp surge from the two-year low of $ 12.60 reached last Oct. 5. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said, `` My feeling is that there seems to be a bullish expectation in the market to see a strong price level. So we will enter the second quarter, which is usually a weak quarter, with a stronger demand than had been foreseen.'' Independent producing nations also were expected to curb exports by a total of less than 300,000 barrels daily in the April-June quarter to support <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the world's largest crude producer, said it would join the cuts in the second quarter, when prices generally decline with the onset of warmer weather in oil-importing countries. With the good wintertime results, the ministers also likely will hold initial discussions on production levels for the second half of this year. Those quotas wo n't be set until a full meeting of all <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers June 5 in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s oil minister, told the <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> should boost its production ceiling by 1.5 million barrels a day to 20 million barrels in the last six months of the year. He said in an interview published Monday that the cartel's price target should be maintained at $ 18 a barrel. Since the production accord, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has reported that 12 of the nations complied with the agreement in January and February by curtailing output for the international market. The cartel said the 12 nations pumped 17.4 million barrels of oil a day in February, compared with the daily ceiling of 17.51 million barrels set for those dozen countries. The statement said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> had not reported supply figures in January or February. That country persistently has exceeded its daily quota of 988,000 barrels. Analysts estimate its current production at more than 1.5 million barrels a day. Ministers who form the monitoring committee represent <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. Other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members are <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Scientists are experimenting with new uses of chemical agents to aid in the cleanup of oil spills, but mechanical methods such as vacuum pumps, `` skimmer'' boats and absorbant pads are still the most widely used. At the spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, the volume of crude oil in the water is so large _ 10.1 million gallons _ that mechanical means are being supplemented with the use of approved chemicals to disperse some of the oil on the surface. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the tanker that spilled the oil Friday near the port of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, also planned to burn `` fingers'' of the oil slick by igniting them with a laser. Experiments also are being conducted with the use of a chemical agent that, rather than dispersing the oil on the water's surface, causes it to draw together to make it easier to remove with vacuum pumps, said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, a cleanup expert with the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Under the best circumstances, some oil remains in the water after a spill cleanup operation. Wind and wave action emulsify some of it. Some is consumed by bacteria. In an ocean spill, oil on the water's surface can be herded into one area by skimmer boats that use wing-like devices to guide it. Vacuum machines then pump it onto floating barges, which take it ashore in tanks and transfer it to trucks. For oil that has washed ashore or entered shallow-water areas in which skimmer boats can not be used, cleanup crews can use a string of absorbant pads that soak up the crude. A variety of chemicals, usually in liquid form, also can be used to break up sections of the oil slick. Some chemical agents are used to make the oil sink to the bottom, where it poses no direct threat to birds. Burning agents also are used, although questions have been raised about whether the advantages brought by these and other chemical agents outweigh the disadvantages of adding more pollutants to the water or air.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> abandoned its eight-month-old struggle to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Monday, less than a week after a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court dealt the company a fatal blow in its attempt to gain control of the instant photography giant Polaroid officials said they entered into an agreement with <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> under which <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> would terminate its $ 3.2 billion tender offer and proxy contest and both sides would end litigation resulting from the Shamrock bid. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and its affiliate companies also agreed not to attempt to gain control of Polaroid for at least 10 years. Shamrock, which offered $ 45 a share for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> stock, was stymied Thursday by a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court decision clearing the way for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> to repurchase 16 million shares at a premium price of $ 50 each. `` We are disappointed and frustrated by the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> courts,'' <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> president <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said Monday. `` It's certainly not good news for folks who are trying to do what we did.'' Some analysts said the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> ruling allowing the <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> purchase could signal a new era in the kinds of defensive strategies planned by takeover targets. `` Up until now, attacking companies have been able to peel away layer by layer of companies' defenses,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Brean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` This is one of the first ways anyone's found to be successful.'' As part of its defense, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> placed an estimated one-third of its shares in friendly hands through the stock buyback, an employee stock ownership plan and the sale of preferred shares to <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION>, an investor group formed to help companies fight hostile takeover bids. The moves were designed to frustrate <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s attempt to unseat the <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> board at the company's annual meeting and its tender offer. Under the settlement, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> will distribute to shareholders part of the after-tax proceeds from a copyright infringement suit against <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>. A trial to determine damages from <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to begin in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> next month. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> also bought $ 5 million worth of advertising on <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s radio and television stations and reimbursed Shamrock for $ 20 million in expenses connected with the litigation and tender offer. Shamrock accumulated 4.95 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> during the takeover battle and tendered all of those shares before the midnight deadline last Thursday. According to filings with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> paid an average price of about $ 31 a share for its stake in <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>. By selling 27 percent of its shares back to <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> for $ 50 each, <LOCATION> Shamrock </LOCATION> can expect to receive approximately $ 67 million. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s remaining 3.6 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> would conservatively be worth more than $ 130 million, yielding a profit of approximately $ 42 million before legal fees, financing costs and other takeover expenses. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> said the final number of shares tendered under the buyback offer, and the definitive pro-rating formula, will be determined April 4. Payments will go out to stockholders as soon as possible after that date, the company said.

 Former defense secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> are among those being considered for the influential role of examiner in the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> bankruptcy reorganization, sources close to the situation said Monday. The examiner, who will have what experts say is an unusually broad mandate for overseeing a bankruptcy case, will be charged with reviewing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> business transactions and mediating disputes among the parties involved in the case, including strike-bound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, its unions and its creditors. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>, who is overseeing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Chapter 11 reorganization, on Thursday ordered the appointment of an examiner with expanded powers, saying it was in the public's interest to do so. Eastern sought bankruptcy court protection from creditors on March 9 becuase of a cash drain stemming from a strike by its Machinists, pilots and flight attendants that has virtually paralyzed the Miami-based airline. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Trustee <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who is administering the Eastern bankruptcy case, said he was considering about a dozen candidates for examiner in the complex proceeding. He said he hoped to decide by late this week or early next week on an examiner to recommend to <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>. In addition to mediating disputes among parties in the case, the examiner will review financial transactions between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, its parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Eastern's unions claim that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> has been attempting to funnel <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, a non-union carrier. The ideal examiner would be `` someone who can play the role of statesman,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Monday. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> declined to name people on the list. But the sources, who asked not to be identified, said the candidates include <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, who represented some claimants in <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s Chapter 11 proceeding that began in August 1982 and ended this past January <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, a securities lawyer, is one of the lead defense attorneys for imprisoned inside trader <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, also a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, now is vice chairman and managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Carlyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an investment banking firm based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> D.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s secretary said he was unavailable to comment and <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> himself declined comment Monday. <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> `` was a very effective and important part of the resolution of our bankruptcy,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> spokesman who wished not to be identified further, speaking from the company's headquarters in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the candidates under consideration were recommended to him either by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management, the airline's unions or the committee of 15 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> creditors he appointed last week. Some of the candidates put themselves forward for the position, he said. `` It's a mediator with clout,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ury </PERSON>, associate director of the program on negotiation at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the unions are looking for `` a strong public figure beholden to no specific interest, including our own.'' The examiner will need to `` bang the parties' heads together to see if a solution can be achieved here,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s lead bankruptcy attorney, said the company would like an examiner who `` has somewhat of a national reputation,'' is impartial and has a strong legal or financial background.

 <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest thrifts, named a new president Monday and said its chief executive officer, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenzie </PERSON>, would soon retire. The moves come after the bank reported a $ 119 million loss in 1988 and only a month after it named a new chairman, <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, who is the company's largest shareholder. <PERSON> Kenzie </PERSON>, 58, will retire June 30, the bank said. His apparent successor is <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, the former head of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was named <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief operating officer, effective April 1, replacing <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruch </PERSON>, who was elected vice chairman. A replacement was not immediately named for <PERSON> Kenzie </PERSON>'s post of chief executive officer. But analysts said <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> would likely be named CEO later. `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s extensive banking background and his management experience will be important assets in <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION>'s ongoing restructuring,'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, 52, is a former president and chief operating officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. While at <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> headed a massive restructuring project that cut more than 10,000 jobs. Since 1987, he has been chairman and chief executive officer of INVEST, a brokerage and investment firm. `` It looks as if things are going to tighten up at <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Peltz </PERSON> of <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bruyette </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was brought in to bring <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION>'s expenses under control. `` It will be a painful job, but presumably that's what he's good at,'' he said. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, who heads the privately held <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, has vowed to change the bank's market approach, avoid risky undertakings, and emphasize traditional businesses. <PERSON> Kenzie </PERSON> presided over the bank's rapid growth from a regional savings bank into a national financial services company engaged in non-traditional businesses such as the financing of leveraged buyouts and commercial lending. Under his leadership the <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s assets increased to $ 15 billion from $ 3 billion, it changed its name to <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION>, built a headquarters building in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, bought troubled savings banks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and became a publicly held company. `` <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenzie </PERSON> built a small western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> savings bank into one of the largest and best known thrift institutions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kenzie </PERSON> joined the bank as president and chief operating officer in 1979.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> is negotiating with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest bank card company for the exclusive right to honor the JCB credit card at more than 100,000 outlets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, bank officials announced Monday `` This historic agreement would allow Japanese tourists and business travelers visiting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to use their most popular credit card throughout our extensive merchant base,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON>, senior vice president in charge of merchant services at the San Francisco-based bank. Bank of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> says it can perform all sales and servicing of <ORGANIZATION> JCB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> card accounts through its existing credit card programs and will bill merchants for <ORGANIZATION> JCB </ORGANIZATION> use through <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> statements Under the deal, no other bank can honor the <ORGANIZATION> JCB </ORGANIZATION> card in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. JCB's six sponsoring Japanese banks, which are not prohibited from setting up their own servicing programs with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchants, currently have no such programs. Through independent arrangements, JCB is accepted at about 20,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses, most of them on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. `` This deal will greatly expand the utility of our card for our holder dramatically, both for visitors and Japanese nationals now living or working in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> JCB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dwane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krumme </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON> indicated <ORGANIZATION> BofA </ORGANIZATION>'s move is the first step toward expanding merchants' ability to accept various bank cards without having to arrange service programs with each sponsoring company. `` We feel this will be a significant step in providing merchants with a convenient, consolidated service for different card types,'' said <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON>.

 Stock prices struggled higher Monday in the slowest trading of the year amid some tentative hopes that interest rates might turn downward soon. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 49.10 points last week, rebounded 14.82 points to 2,257.86. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 767 up, 655 down and 530 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 112.96 million shares, down from 153.75 million last Thursday and the lightest total since a 110.63 million-share day on Dec. 28. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 135 million shares. The market has drawn some support lately from suggestions by analysts that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> may bide its time for a while before deciding whether to tighten credit further. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, chairman of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Council of Economic Advisers, said in a weekend interview that he believes interest rates are close to peaking out. He predicted lower rates later in the year. But worries have also increased of late that subsiding interest rates could be accompanied by a slowing of economic activity significant enough to qualify as a recession. In some scripts now being written on the Street, that would mean that corporate profits might also be topping out about now. American Medical International led the active list and jumped 3 | to 21 -LCB- An investor group made a $ 24-a-share buyout offer for the company. Other hospital-management stocks moved up in sympathy. <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> gained 1 to 29 | and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> added \ to 27 -RCB- <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> fell 4 -LCB- to 36.

The company announced the sale of its Coldwell Banker commercial real-estate business to the unit's employees and an investor group. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 44 -LCB-, recovering from some early selling on news of the huge oil spill that occurred when an <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> tanker ran aground Friday near <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 11.26 billion, or 0.39 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks gained .68 to 163.32. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 1.94 to 334.73, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.59 at 290.57.

 Grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid forecasts for April showers in the nation's major crop-growing areas. On other markets, orange juice futures surged for the second straight session; energy futures advanced sharply; precious metals were lower and livestock and meat futures were mixed. Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 4 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in May at $ 4.27 \ a bushel; corn was 6 \ cents to 7 -RCB- cents lower with May at $ 2.71 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 9 \ cents to 10 cents lower with May at $ 1.95 \ a bushel; soybeans were 12 cents to 16 cents lower with May at $ The selloff in the grain and soybean markets was widely seen as a reaction to Friday's 6-to-10-day <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecast for above-average rainfall March 30-April 3 in most of the central and all of the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The winter wheat crop in the central and southern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> is in need of precipitation and rain also is needed to replenish soil moisture in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, where corn, soybean and oat planting will soon begin. Further selling was attributed to internal market influences and to increasingly bearish expectations for Friday's planted-acreage estimate and quarterly grain stocks report from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` The combination of the threat of precipitation and that very important government report just triggered a lot of liquidation,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a large Chicago-based futures brokerage. A new 6-to-10-day <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecast issued after the close called for mostly dry weather in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and parts of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> April 2-6. The soybean market appeared to lead the collapse but oats registered the steepest relative losses. Oats for May and July delivery fell the permitted daily limit of 10 cents a bushel. Frozen concentrated orange juice futures soared the 5-cents-a-pound limit on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on buying linked to reports that some of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s largest orange-juice processors had raised or planned to raise their wholesale prices to $ 1.60 - $ 1.65 a pound from $ 1.50 The price increase may cause a scramble for near-term deliveries but projections for abundant supplies from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> should ensure against supply tightness, said analyst <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganes </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Orange juice settled 4.70 to 5 cents higher with May at $ 1.609 a pound Oil futures rose sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid supply-shortage fears linked to the massive oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The spill forced a shutdown of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Port of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, cutting the pipeline output of Alaskan crude oil by more than half. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .13 cent to .42 cent higher with May at $ 20.53 a barrel; heating oil was .86 cent to 1.06 cents higher with April at 57.58 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .35 cent to 1.83 cents higher with April at 59.75 cents a gallon. Gold and silver futures fell on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting a continued easing of inflation fears. Gold settled $ 1.70 to $ 2.10 lower with April at $ 391.60 a troy ounce; silver was 5.7 cents to 6 cents lower with May at $ 6.003 a troy ounce. Cattle futures finished mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, led by a surge of speculative and commercial buying in the feeder cattle market amid indications strong consumer demand. Pork futures ended the day lower with most of the selling stemming from Friday's <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> cold-storage report, which showed a record number of pork bellies in cold storage for the fourth consecutive month. Live cattle settled .25 cent lower to .35 cent higher with April at 78.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .28 cent to 1.10 cents higher with April at 81.97 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .43 cent lower with April at 42.27 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .18 cent to .98 cent lower with May at 37.17 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
 The massive oil spill that threatens waterfowl and fish off the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> coast is expected to give ammunition to environmentalists fighting to keep oil developers out of a pristine arctic wildlife refuge. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must approve oil exploration in the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> where the petroleum industry believes much oil is hidden. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsed oil drilling along a 1.5 million acre coastal strip of the refuge if it can be done within environmental guidelines, and legislation allowing exploration passed a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee earlier this month. But aides for senators on both sides of the issue suggested Monday that the momentum is likely to slow considerably in light of the accident involving the tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> and the oil spill in the environmentally sensitive Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked Monday about such speculation, said that `` at this point, we would not try to make any sweeping judgments based on the oil spill, certainly not policy judgments.'' With more than 10 million gallons of oil flowing into the sound, it is the worst oil spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history and threatens waterfowl, fish, sea otter and other wildlife as well as the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> fishing industry. The Exxon oil tanker that ran aground was carrying petroleum which had been shipped from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s North Slope through the trans-Alaska pipeline to <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> and then put aboard the tanker. The controversy over drilling in the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> involves a coastal plain just east of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Slope </LOCATION> oil fields. Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> environmental protection subcommittee, said Monday the spill puts into question the oil industry's assurances that they can protect the environment `` The oil and gas industries have been very willing to provide assurances that the -LRB- arctic refuge -RRB- will be developed in an environmentally responsible manner,'' said <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>. `` Unfortunately the oil spill ... is the latest and most tragic evidence of the gap that exists between past industry assurances and actual industry performance in preventing environmental damage.'' Environmental groups also suggested the accident raises questions whether there can be oil development and still guarantee environmental protection as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has suggested in his support of drilling in the refuge. `` This -LRB- spill -RRB- ought to make <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intensely aware that when you have development you're going to have environmental consequences. Period. It's a reality,'' said <PERSON> Syd </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, a vice president for the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which has been lobbying intensely against opening the arctic refuge for drilling. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, a lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, noted reports that the Exxon tanker was being handled by a crewman who did not have proper credentials when it ran aground, and suggested the episode `` calls into question'' how much priority the oil industry puts on environmental concerns. `` It's pretty clear this kind of disaster is going to happen any time you have oil development and oil production,'' said <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement, called the tanker spill `` a very regrettable situation'' and acknowledged it may have an impact on pending petroleum legislation, including the question of drilling in the arctic refuge. But <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, chief spokesman for the industry lobbying group, said it was `` really much too soon to tell what the reaction is going to be.'' Ever since the petroleum industry discovered the possiblity of large oil and gas deposits under the tundra of the northeastern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> refuge, there has been pressure to open the refuge's coastal strip for exploratory drilling. Some estimates are that it could produce as much as 3.2 billion barrels of oil and keep the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> pipeline flowing well after North Slope oil is gone. But the refuge also is the breeding ground for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest remaining herd of migratory caribou and the habitat for polar bears, musk oxen, wolves, arctic foxes and an assortment of waterfowl A recent congressional study suggested that oil development in the refuge would produce about the same environmental disruption as has occurred in the North Slope fields. Legislation allowing drilling in the refuge cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on March 16, but likely will be debated in the environmental committee before any floor action. Meanwhile, bills also have been introduced to declare the refuge a formal wilderness area, which would prohibit oil or gas development.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it would seek bankruptcy court protection from creditors, a move that would block an attempt to force the sale of the troubled banking company but also might hamper a federal plan to rescue its failing subsidiary banks. A filing for protection by <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' second-largest bank holding company, would supercede a request made last week by three minor bondholders for an involuntary liquidation of the company. The maneuvering comes amid a six-month effort by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to rescue the 25 banks owned by <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>, which has assets totaling about $ 20 billion and parent company debt of about $ 418 million. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> sought federal recapitalization assistance last October due to deepening financial losses. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s banks lost $ 903 million in 1988, $ 213 million in the fourth quarter, according to the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> officials have met with noteholders several times since last fall, urging them not to take action against the company despite its moratorium on paying debts while it tried to recapitalize. `` MCorp deeply regrets that those noteholders ignored our pleas not to take premature and unnecessary action,'' <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer, said in a prepared statement. Mirroring comments by several industry analysts, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rieke </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Rauscher </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Refsnes </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, speculated that the bondholders decided to seek liquidation of <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> because of concerns that the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> was moving too slowly in rescuing its banks. `` I think a more expedited decision process would have resolved the problems and the bondholders' fears,'' <PERSON> Rieke </PERSON> said. `` There just has n't been any apparent desire by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> to resolve the issues, and that caused a buildup of uncertainty detrimental to all involved.'' <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Katasnos </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> procedures have been relatively swift. `` You're talking about asking someone to buy a banking organization that has rather substantial losses and a masssive portfolio to review,'' <PERSON> Katasnos </PERSON> said. `` You do n't ask someone to engage in a multi-million transfer without giving them ample opportunity to review documents and operations before they submit an informed bid.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> has set an April 3 deadline for bids. Neither the bankruptcy petition nor the company's reorganization filing should affect bank business, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said. The Chapter 7 petitioners were S.N. <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, bond broker that claims to hold $ 2 million principal amount in <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> debentures; and <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eberhardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, each of whom claims to hold $ 5,000 in debentures, according to a copy of the filing provided by S.N. <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON>. S.N. <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> submitted a claim of $ 93,750 in interest and Ms. <PERSON> Eberhardt </PERSON> sought $ 234.38 in principal payment. <PERSON> James </PERSON> did not list a claim amount in the petition. <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bader </PERSON>, a New York-based attorney for the holders, told the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> his clients decided to seek Chapter 7 liquidation for fear that <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> would be forced to pump holding company assets into the failing banks, putting the money out of creditors' reach. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> has authority to sell or otherwise dispose of insolvent banks closed by the Comptroller of the Currency, but a bankruptcy filing would make any plan to sell the holding company subject to bankruptcy court approval. The request for <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> assistance appeared to hinge on $ 400 million set aside by <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> for the deal. Federal regulators reportedly wanted that money put into the local banks before they would consider an assistance package. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors indicated they would fight such a move, apparently fearing a repeat of last year's rescue of Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Regulators took over that company's subsidiary banks and left the holding company with almost no assets to pay off its <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> has 20 days to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court reorganization after being served with the creditors' petitions for the involuntary Chapter 7 liquidation, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> had not received the petitions by late Monday, said spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCane </PERSON>. The company learned Friday the petition had been filed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, southern district of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

The offer from <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> and two former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> officers, which presumes acceptance of management, is for $ 24 a share _ $ 20 to $ 22 of that in cash and the rest in securities. The buyers would assume $ 1.4 billion in long-term debt. At the same time <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>'s proposal was announced, the company revealed it was considering a restructuring plan it said would boost the company's value to $ 25 to $ 29 per share. The company refused to reveal further details of the restructuring. A special committee of the board began weighing the proposals Monday. Spokesman <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said the study was expected to take a few weeks. American Medical led the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s most-active list, jumping $ 3.62 -LCB- a share to $ 21.50. The company owns 55 acute-care and psychiatric hospitals in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 20 oversease in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. The domestic hospitals are in 15 states, most of them in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. All have AMI in their names. <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>'s offer was made with <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> partnership including former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> executives <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>. It is unrelated to <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which Monday abandoned a bid for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION>, under pressure from <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> and others to boost flat earnings and improve its stock price, has over the last two years sold more than 40 hospitals and laid off 2,000 Further efforts to pare the company down to a profitable core include sale of non-hospital subsidiaries including outpatient surgery centers, <ORGANIZATION> AMICARE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> health plans, and alcohol and drug rehabilitation services. Asset sales are likely under either the buyout or the reorganization, particularly of the company's overseas hospitals. <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalif </PERSON>, said the potential buyers would expect to sell non-core businesses, possibly including the foreign operations. American Medical refused to release any details of its proposed restructuring, but analysts suggested that plan, too, would involve sale of assets. `` Basically, we're talking about scaling back to a group of the most attractive hospitals,'' said analyst <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Alperstein </PERSON>, who follows the company for <ORGANIZATION> Bateman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eichler </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> securities firm. She called $ 24 a fair price apresent, but suggested an aggressive restructuring effort that includes sale of unprofitable hospitals could boost the company's value into the high $ 20s per share in a year. Sale of the overseas hospitals could bring $ 450 million, Ms. <PERSON> Alperstein </PERSON> estimated. In addition to asset sales, the restructuring plan could include moving the headquarters out of expensive <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, a direct cash dividend to shareholders and a stock buyback, said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Richter </PERSON>, who follows the company for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He values the company at $ 25 to $ 30 a share. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that its earnings declined to $ 18.1 million, or 26 cents per share, for the three months ending Feb. 28, on revenues of $ 678.2 million. During the same period a year earlier, earnings were $ 24.1 million, or 30 cents per share, on revenues of $ 766.1 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is likely to pay willingly for the cleanup of the Alaskan oil spill to avoid controversy that could hurt its opportunity to explore for oil in an arctic wildlife refuge, oil analysts said Monday. Exxon is so big that even if it had to pay $ 100 million out of its own coffers for the cleanup its earnings would be lowered by only a nickel a share, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Knuettel </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. A bigger priority for the company is winning congressional approval for oil companies to explore in the pristine <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Knuettel </PERSON> said The oil spill from the tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> has slowed momentum for the authorization, which passed a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee earlier this month, aides to senators on both sides of the issue said Monday. `` They'd want to handle this as quickly and efficiently as possible'' to limit the damage to its image, <PERSON> Knuettel </PERSON> said. `` This obviously is a setback.'' The Exxon Valdez, carrying 1.2 million barrels of North Slope crude oil, ran onto a reef 25 miles from port early Friday. Estimates put the spill at 240,000 barrels of oil, or about 10.1 million gallons, making it the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spill on record. Reflecting investors' lack of concern about the spill, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s stock closed unchanged at $ 44.50 a share in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading A long delay in resumption of shipping from the Valdez terminal could hurt <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and other producers if it forced them to cease production temporarily, cutting into their revenue, said <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Fliakos </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. As for the cleanup itself, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> is liable for the first $ 14 million in damages under terms of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act Up to $ 86 million more could be paid out of a <ORGANIZATION> Trans-Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liability </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> that was funded by tariffs on oil production by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and several smaller <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil producers. However, the administrator of the fund, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, said Monday that the fund could seek reimbursement from <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> if there was evidence <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was negligent in the spill. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, who is treasurer of <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> might choose to pay the full costs up front if it wanted to avoid a controversy with the fund over possible negligence. He said he had not heard from Exxon on the matter. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> is a party to two insurance-related agreements, the Tanker Owners Voluntary Agreement Concerning Liability for Oil Pollution and the Contract Regarding A Supplement To Tanker Liability for Oil Pollution. But <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> failed to provide information by late Monday on how those agreements could diminish the cost to Exxon of the cleanup. <PERSON> Knuettel </PERSON> said he did not know if <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s admission that an unlicensed third mate was at the helm of the tanker at the time of the crash could affect its ability to collect on the insurance.

 <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has dropped a federal patent-infringement lawsuit filed here against <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, but has filed a virtually identical lawsuit in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, officials of the two companies said Monday. The lawsuit filed in January in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here alleged that <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> was engaging in unfair competition with its new H-8 microprocessor. `` <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> does not know why <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> no longer wishes to pursue its claims in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the site of <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>'s national headquarters,'' said a statement issued by Tokyo-based <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, home of its <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. `` <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> believes <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> remains the proper place for these lawsuits and it will resist <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>'s tactical maneuvers to avoid the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> courts.'' But spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sengstock </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in suburban <LOCATION> Schaumburg </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview that <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> has two plants in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> that make the microprocessors involved in the lawsuit. He said the `` procedural move'' to <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> `` focuses the matter -LRB- to -RRB- the center of our ... microprocessor activity and the site of all the documents, evidence and witnesses.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> also has filed a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> court, alleging that the <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> 68HC11 microcontroller infringes on a <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> patent. <PERSON> Sengstock </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> is seeking to have the cases combined in the federal court in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> has said that the alleged unfair competition began shortly after <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> granted a patent license to <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> for certain <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> microprocessors in May 1986. The company said the <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> H-8 microprocessor series infringes on at least four <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> patents. <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> has denied any wrongdoing. <PERSON> Sengstock </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> would seek an injunction to stop distribution of the disputed <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> microprocessors in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The lawsuit also seeks unspecified damages, he said. Microprocessors are digital electronic devices that perform control and arithmetic functions in a computer. They often contain hundreds of thousands of microscopic transistors on silicon chips about a quarter-inch square.

 <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, who once was hailed as a financial whiz kid, was sentenced to 25 years in prison and ordered to pay $ 26 million restitution for fraud by a judge who called him a charismatic liar. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dickran </PERSON> <PERSON> Tevrizian </PERSON> handed <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, 23, the maximum penalty sought by the government. `` You're dangerous,'' <PERSON> Tevrizian </PERSON> told the 23-year-old <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, `` because you have this gift of gab, this ability to communicate ... -LRB- and -RRB- you do n't have a conscience.'' <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, who founded the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> ZZZZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> carpet cleaning company, was convicted of 57 counts of securities, credit card and mail fraud on Dec. 14. The government's sentencing memorandum described <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> as a remorseless liar and thief whose schemes cost victims more than $ 100 million. In arguments during Monday's hearing, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Asperger </PERSON> said <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> would probably serve only a third of any sentence imposed. In pleading for a lenient sentence, <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> compared himself to former financier <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who is serving a three-year prison sentence for his role in the Wall Street insider trading scandal. `` This is a great day for this country,'' said <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, clad in blue prison-issue shirt and pants. `` This is a great day for justice. This is how <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> works.'' He commended the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys who prosecuted him, saying, `` They got the right guy. They got the guilty guy. `` I see victims here today,'' he said, turning toward the audience. `` I can only say to them how sorry I am, and I'm going to get what I've got coming, every bit of it.'' But the judge was unmoved by <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s plea or a similar one by defense attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON>, who asked for a sentence of eight to 10 years and psychological counseling for his client. `` That would be a joke,'' snapped <PERSON> Tevrizian </PERSON>. `` Here is someone who has corrupted the financial system. Here is someone who has lied and cheated. That sentence would be a slap on the wrist.'' After <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s appeal, <PERSON> Tevrizian </PERSON> told him, `` You tell me you're sorry and I think, ` Is he trying to clean my carpet or what? The judge ordered that <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> serve five years probation following his release and that the probation would be conditional on his paying the $ 26 million restitution as well as any back taxes or civil judgments against him. The judge also ordered him to participate in a drug dependency program. <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> said outside court that he would try to get <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s sentence reduced <PERSON> Tevrizian </PERSON> has sentenced 10 other defendants in the case to terms of a month to eight years. In their sentencing memo, <PERSON> Asperger </PERSON> and Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> carried out a `` five-year crime wave'' that `` amounted to a search-and-destroy mission aimed at the trust and integrity of our financial institutions, securities markets and the public at large.'' But <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> said in a reply memorandum that the young entrepreneur was a victim himself, browbeaten by mobsters and emotionally damaged by a `` dysfunctional family'' characterzied by `` physical abuse, emotional neglect, embarassment, secrecy, lying and mental disorders galore.'' `` The true story of <ORGANIZATION> ZZZZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> is a young man almost constantly in debt, struggling to prove that he will not become the failure depicted by his father,'' <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> said. `` Look closely and you will see the picture of a compulsive debtor.'' <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, who launched ZZZZ Best at age 16 in his parents' garage, has insisted he was a captive of mobsters who took over his company and forced him to commit fraud. The government claimed he was a shrewd con man who convinced Wall Street investors and TV talk show hosts that he was a teen-age genius. The collapse of ZZZZ Best rocked the volatile <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> money markets and exposed the vulnerability of major securities firms and banks, which bought <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s sales pitch and committed millions to his company. At the center of <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s confidence scheme was a claim that ZZZZ Best was making a fortune restoring water - and fire-damaged buildings Investors were given badges and hard hats and taken on tours of alleged restoration projects in abandoned buildings with which ZZZZ Best had no connection. `` The magnitude and seriousness of defendant <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s criminal conduct, coupled with his level of sophistication and ability to manipulate both his cohorts and victims clearly place him among the most significant white-collar criminals ever prosecuted on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>,'' the prosecutors said.
