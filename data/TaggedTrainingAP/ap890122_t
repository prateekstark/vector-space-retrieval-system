 Horns blared, fireworks lighted the sky and strangers kissed in the streets Sunday night as fans celebrating the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> 49ers Super Bowl victory turned the town into an impromptu open-air party. Authorities closed several streets and Highway 480 near the Embarcadero because of crowds. Police reported numerous arrests, most for public drunkenness, but did not have exact figures. Roman candles rocketed aloft as fans in the largely Hispanic Mission District erupted into the streets to celebrate the 20-16 last-minute victory over the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bengals </ORGANIZATION>. `` We stomped them like bugs in a barn,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON>, 21, from his post on a jammed street corner. `` For the last five minutes, it was like having an electric eel attached to your spine.'' `` I feel great,'' said <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> as he jumped up and down on a crowded sidewalk, waving a 6-foot-long 49ers banner. `` I knew it all the way. I never gave up, I never gave up.'' A man leaned from an apartment window overlooking Mission Street, and played a trombone. `` We expect the unusual right now,'' said Officer <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON> at the Mission District police station. `` Cars driving by with their boom boxes, honking their horns. They're going pretty good out there.'' Additional officers were on duty for the evening, <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON> said, although she could n't say how many. At the jammed Mad Hatter sports bar, fans leaped into the air, roaring, slapping high fives and wagging fingers at the television screen. At <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>'s, a bar, host <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said the atmosphere has been `` insane'' all day. `` They've been going crazy ...,'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said. `` We knew we were going to win it.'' `` You ca n't walk on the street, you ca n't get in the door,'' he said. `` That's what's going on. We had fire trucks, horses and police blowing their sirens. It was great. Now they're blocking off the street.'' At a <LOCATION> Redwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> bar-restaurant called <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s, which is owned by former 49ers wide receiver <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, the crowd `` went crazy'' when 49er quarterback <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Montana </PERSON> was shown on the post-game show wearing a hat advertising the tavern, said hostess <PERSON> Pameaux </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>. `` We had people on top of people and people on each other's laps, sitting, standing, leaning,'' she said. Elsewhere, the broadcast of the game was interrupted for fans in at least two parts of the country. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the audio portion of a cable television broadcast was disrupted for a few seconds with music from `` The Jetsons'' cartoon and an anti-Semitic slur. `` First there was music from ` The Jetsons' cartoon show. Then someone said something about Century Cable and ` there's too many -LRB- expletive deleted -RRB- Jews in this industry,''' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Debber </PERSON>, a viewer in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>. The interruption occurred about 3:15 p.m. when an audio signal invaded Century's cable system, affecting viewers in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, a company official said. `` I'm baffled at how it was done and I'm shocked and outraged at the statements that were made,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosendahl </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>. In eastern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and the northern panhandle of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, viewers of <ORGANIZATION> WTOV </ORGANIZATION> television missed much of the second quarter. Technical problems put the station off the air for about 25 minutes, a station worker said. The station serves a market of 154,000 households.

 Profound changes are at work in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, sent reeling this decade with blows to its auto, steel and farming powerhouses. For autos, the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> was the place, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> the hub. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> also boasted auto plants. Now, Japanese automakers are setting up shop in rural, largely white communities and jobs are becoming increasingly scarce for big-city blacks. The first story in a four-part AP Extra series, `` The Changing Heartland,'' examines this trend.

 With a college campus and fertile fields, this patch of <ORGANIZATION> mid-America </ORGANIZATION> is a place where students learn and farmers earn side by side. But corn country has a new face producing a new crop _ cars. Last fall, this tranquil town and its twin city, <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, joined a growing number of smaller <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> locales with Japanese-associated plants that are shaking up the auto industry. The increasing Japanese presence in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s midsection _ plants in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, one planned for <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Chrysler-Mitsubishi </PERSON> here _ is creating work and growth in white rural areas while jobs and opportunity disappear in heavily minority big cities. `` Certainly, it's a restructuring of the auto industry,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> urban affairs and sociology professor. `` The reorganization ... is definitely detrimental to blacks.'' The trend has aroused concern in a business that's already lost thousands of blue-collar jobs, raised questions about potential bias, and worried blacks, who've long regarded the auto industry as a steppingstone to a better life. `` Auto shops were really the bridge that brought black people from the lower class to the middle class,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, former head of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> local at a closed <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> plant. `` What are you going to do for the people left behind, locked up in the ghetto who have no place to go and no car to get out to rural areas?'' Japanese automakers, who've invested $ 5 billion in U.S.-based facilities in the last decade, point to their affirmative action programs and insist transportation, education and the work ethic _ not race _ determine location. But some academics also claim the Japanese generally avoid unionized areas and towns with large pools of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> autoworkers, preferring to train novices. Whatever the reason, communities such as Bloomington-Normal _ thriving, white-collar towns that are worlds apart from gasping-for-survival, blue-collar cities like <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> _ are becoming motor capitals. `` It's just a different culture,'' said <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Smart </PERSON>. `` This whole city is like a big neighborhood. -LRB- And -RRB- with modern auto plants being clean, it's not smokestack anymore; it's compatible with agriculture. In Bloomington-Normal, insurance, farming and academia are big. Urban blight, crime and unemployment are not. Bloomington-Normal, 4 percent minority, had a 4.1 percent unemployment rate in October. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, 65 percent minority, had a 10.1 percent jobless level. Studies have shown black men have been devastated by industrial decline. In the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area, 52 percent of black men in heavy manufacturing production lost their jobs from 1979 to 1984, according to a study by <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> State's <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. Nationwide, about 27 percent of blacks lost their heavy manufacturing jobs in the same period, said the study, based on <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> reports. Future prospects are even bleaker. A 1988 study concluded Japanese `` behavior with regard to site location and hiring practices heightens rather than eases the dilemma of blacks who are being rapidly displaced from their traditional American employers.'' The study, by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> professors <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Deskins </PERSON>, said although they had no concrete evidence, they believe `` avoidance of blacks is one factor'' for the Japanese in determining plant sites. `` I think it's a factor,'' <PERSON> Deskins </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't say this is their intent.'' The study found while blacks comprise 11 percent of the civilian labor force, they represent 17.2 percent of workers at the Big Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers. In contrast, the study said, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s plant in <LOCATION> Flat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, has a potential black labor pool of 29 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, has one of 10.5 percent. Company officials say their black workforce is 15.1 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> disagreed with the calculations and also pointed out the company recruits at black colleges. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, however, agreed last March to give $ 6 million to 377 blacks and women after an <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> investigation concluded they should have been hired sooner. The <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> claimed <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> employed discriminatory practices with a 30-mile hiring radius that excluded <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which has the area's largest minority population. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, which expanded its hiring area before the settlement, admitted no wrongdoing. Many Japanese-associated auto plants are close to universities and near Interstate 75, dubbed Auto Alley, which stretches south from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> is in <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, near the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION>; Chrysler-Mitsubishi is in Normal, home of <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> Subaru-Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is near <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, across the river from <LOCATION> Purdue </LOCATION>. These towns say automakers are attracted to cheaper land, lower taxes, open space and a well-educated work force. Bloomington-Normal, population 87,718, was appealing because of its good highway and rail systems, incentives, strong work ethic and schools, said <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Diamond-Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the firm formed by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION>. `` We needed people with very good communication skills _ verbal, written and reading,'' he said. `` Some of the major larger cities have a very difficult time graduating significant numbers of students.'' In <LOCATION> Tippecanoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, surrounding <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, one in four people 25 years and older has four years of college, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lafayette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit development corporation. `` What kind of public education system does <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> have?'' he asked. `` What kind of technological capability in terms of college graduates does <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> have? `` There's no God-given right big cities should be viewed as the automotive centers,'' he said. `` We small towns, technologically sophisticated centers, think we can compete, too.''

 They do, engaging in fierce bidding wars, offering free land and water, road and sewer improvements, employee training funds and tax abatements. Chrysler-Mitsubishi received $ 88.7 million in state incentives alone, including 630 acres of farm land. `` Nobody ever offered us a site in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> ... Detroit ... -LRB- or -RRB- <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. Experts also say Japanese automakers prefer areas where unions are n't strong. `` They're afraid wages will be high,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` They're afraid unions will create demands that will make the company unproductive.'' <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> is atypical _ it is 25 miles from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and, spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said, the only wholly owned subsidiary of a Japanese automaker with <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> affiliation. `` If you're going to locate in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said, `` you best be prepared to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>, because of its location, also has many former Big Three employees _ nearly a fourth of its workers. But <PERSON> Vladmir </PERSON> <PERSON> Pucik </PERSON>, international business professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, said the Japanese prefer `` a relatively inexperienced labor force so they can train them in the Japanese way of doing things. They want to go somewhere so nobody will say, ` At <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, we did it differently.'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> conceded Chrysler-Mitsubishi sought fresh faces. `` We did n't want to have another car plant that -LRB- would -RRB- have 20 years of experience transferred to our plant,'' he said. `` We wanted some green people when it comes to building cars.'' But he said any suggestion race was involved in site selection was `` utter nonsense'' and any charge `` we selected a town to stay away from a union ... is absolutely and unequivocally dead wrong.'' The plant was built with a 100 percent unionized labor force. <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> Mayor Smart says the Japanese will be happy they built here. `` When you get into any rural setting, people are not afraid to put in long hours,'' he said. `` Here there's a satisfaction in seeing the end result. You're just bred that way.''

<HEAD>Gang Member Says Robinson Ordered `Hit' On Barber</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> street gang member testified Saturday that <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> ordered a `` hit'' to kill a former employee, but the witness admitted he was promised money and leniency for cooperating with authorities. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> businessman and the half-brother of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, is accused of hiring the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rukn </LOCATION> gang to kill <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> `` Hambone'' Barber in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> in January 1986. He pleaded innocent to the murder and conspiracy charges earlier this month. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, known as `` Toomba'' in the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rukn </LOCATION> gang, also has been charged with murder in the 1986 slaying. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said he was the brother-in-law of <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Fort </PERSON>, the gang leader who is serving time in a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> prison on drug charges. Testimony has described the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rukn </LOCATION> as a violent organization that makes millions of dollars from the sale of narcotics, murder-for-hire, extortion and racketeering. Another former gang member, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, testified Friday that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was a close friend of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> and wielded some power in the organization. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> were childhood friends in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> once worked for <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> agreed last week to combine in the same trial the charges stemming from the Barber shooting and the charge that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> conspired to kill <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosemond </PERSON>, a witness to the murder, who survived a stabbing attack. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said he met <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1985, but said he did not recall the month. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> -RRB- told us he needed hit duty.'' When Solicitor <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> asked if <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> offered to pay for the murder, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> `` mentioned $ 10,000.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said that as a general in the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rukn </LOCATION>, he relayed the information to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION>, who told him and several other gang members to `` take care of it.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said that during another meeting at <PERSON> Roinson </PERSON>'s home, the defendant gave them $ 2,000 in expense money to travel to <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>. He said a first attempt to kill <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> failed because several members of the gang got into an argument over how to execute the killing. The second trip to <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> ended in the fatal shooting of Barber in front of a business owned by <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. During cross examination from <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Simone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> admitted that he lived a `` double life'' and that he sometimes lied. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> also said he was promised as much as $ 100,000 from federal authorities for information about <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> described <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> as a `` liar who makes deals to save his own life.'' `` I'm telling the truth because I decided I was going to take control of my life,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> maintained. `` Nobody _ not Mr. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and not <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> _ tells me what to do.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> also testified the prosecution said it would not seek the death penalty against him in return for his cooperation. `` Your real interest right here now is delivering up <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> on a platter,'' <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> said. `` You know very well that federal authorities wanted to get <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> has maintained that federal authorities wanted to frame him to discredit <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, while the former Democratic presidential hopeful said he had no recent contact with his half-brother.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Deaths of Wild Dogs Was Clue To Suspected Libyan Chemical
Plant</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Bryen is cq in 8th graf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' assertion that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was building a chemical weapons plant involved luck, old-fashioned spying, high-technology surveillance and meticulous analysis, a newspaper reported Sunday. But it was the deaths of wild dogs in the Libyan desert that provided the crucial clue that the plant was allegedly intended to produce chemical warfare weapons, The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. A toxic spill of chemical wastes at the site last August apparently killed the dogs, and panicked Libyans breached security by using international phone lines to call the German firm helping them build the plant. For the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence analysts accumulating bits of information about the plant, the excited telephone calls sealed the case they had been building. The phone conversation was picked up by sophisticated electronic intelligence equipment, reportedly revealing the nature of the plant and the involvement of West German firms. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has denied the charges, saying the plant will produce pharmaceuticals. Sources have confirmed British-U.S. cooperation in the detection, but have n't said whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monitoring stations or well-placed British listening posts in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> picked up the Libyans' call. The discovery was the first time that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monitoring has exposed construction of a chemical warfare facility, the newspaper said. But `` we've got a long way to go before any of us can take comfort,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryen </PERSON>, a recently retired deputy undersecretary for trade security policy at the Pentagon. `` The fact is that no government is very well-organized to deal with this problem.'' The compilation of data included satellite photos of a major construction project in the middle of nowhere, the curious involvement of an Arab businessman who used circuitous routes to ship equipment to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, and pictures of an oversized ventilation system usually associated with micro-toxin production, the Times said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kupperman </PERSON>, an expert on arms and terrorism at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said biological weapons pose some of the most difficult detection problems because facilities can be smaller. For example, a batch of anthrax that could kill millions of people could be concocted in `` a room the size of a broom closet,'' <PERSON> Kupperman </PERSON> said.

 Convicted murderer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> confessed to at least nine killings while his lawyers maneuvered to block his execution scheduled for Tuesday, officials from two Western states said Saturday. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> confessed to killing at least eight young women in western <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state in 1974, investigator <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Keppel </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney general's office said. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> also confessed to the 1975 slaying of a 26-year-old <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, ski shop employee whose body was never found, <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughey </PERSON> said. Bundy who grew up in <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, was scared, shaken and tearful as he responded to questions from investigators, <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> KIRO-TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday night in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` The man is trying to save his life,'' <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, scheduled to die in the electric chair for the kidnap-murder of 12-year-old <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> in 1978, has been linked to as many as 36 killings and disappearances of young women in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and other Western states. The 42-year-old law school dropout was visited Saturday by officials from several Western states, and more interviews were scheduled for Sunday, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, assistant warden at <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> State Prison in <LOCATION> Starke </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s lawyers lost two more bids for a stay of execution Saturday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, who in 1987 called <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> `` a diabolical genius'' and `` probably the most competent serial killer in the country at this time,'' denied a request for a stay Saturday morning. A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> denied <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s appeal in a telephone conference Saturday afternoon without addressing any of the legal issues, said court clerk <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>. As a last resort, attorneys can appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, but the nation's high court already refused to hear a separate Bundy appeal Tuesday. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> last week had offered to trade information about other slayings for a delay in his execution, but Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who signed <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s fourth death warrant Jan. 17, refused, saying he would not `` negotiate with a killer.'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> also has been sentenced to die for the murders of two <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sorority sisters, but he had not previously admitted to any slayings. <PERSON> Hughey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> acknowledged killing <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, who disappeared in <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION> March 15, 1975. `` Detectives believe the confession is indeed valid,'' he said, noting <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s details about the victim, her clothes and the <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION> area have been persuasive. The police chief gave this recounting of what <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said: He approached her on crutches asking for help, one of several ruses attributed to the suspected serial killer. She agreed to carry his ski boots to his car, where <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> knocked her unconscious with a metal bar. The woman regained consciousness after 20-30 miles west of <LOCATION> Glenwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, but he knocked her unconscious again, strangled her, left her body where she fell and drove to <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. He returned four or five weeks later and buried her. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> confessed to the eight `` Ted'' murders, said <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION>, who had been a police detective working on those cases in the 1970s. Witnesses had reported seeing a charming young stranger who called himself `` Ted'' in the area where several victims disappeared. For the parents of one victim, <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rancourt </PERSON>, the confession helps write the final chapter to a tragedy. `` It's been an open wound for 15 years, and every time we think it's settling down, something happens,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Rancourt </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Rancourt </PERSON>, of LaConner, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> `` There will always be that loss that we can not replace, but at least we can put it all together. <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> admitted to three additional <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state killings, but he was `` at a loss'' to say whether <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was telling the truth about those cases, or just trying to buy time. <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> provided no details of the three additional killings. <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> confirmed in addition to the deaths of the eight victims that some unidentified bones found near the east <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Issaquah </LOCATION>, where two victims were found, were those of <PERSON> Georgann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> student who disappeared from an alley behind her sorority house on June 11, 1974. Her remains had never been found, although <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police considered her a `` Ted'' victim. <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> hopes to talk to Bundy again Sunday, he said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, a defense attorney before being elected a prosecutor in the <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> area in November, told the <ORGANIZATION> Orlando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> late Friday that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> called him last Tuesday and said: `` I want to tell it all, but it will take longer than six days.'' <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, who befriended <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> and has acted as a spiritual adviser for two years, told the Sentinel he believes it could take as long as several months for <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> to tell detectives everything they want to know, including where the remains of some victims are. `` Bundy had over 10 years to tell what he had to tell, and if he is now telling all, that's nice, I'm pleased, but his execution should n't be delayed any longer,'' said Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> on Saturday did not return telephone calls from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Abortion Support Still Splits Americans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sixteen years after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> legalized abortions, Americans' views remain sharply split on the issue, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. Polls over the years have found a majority of Americans consistently support legalized abortion when the woman's health is endangered, when the pregnancy results from rape or incest, or if the baby might be born with a birth defect. But the support dips below 50 percent when the reason a woman wants an abortion is that she is unmarried, does not want the baby or is too poor. Although recent polls indicate that a majority of Americans do not want the landmark Jan. 22, 1973, <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision, <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, overturned, other polls indicate support for legalized abortions is dropping. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, director of general social surveys for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the differing results stem from how pollsters phrase questions. `` The reason you get different results is that there are 10 percent of the people who are absolutely against abortion, except maybe to save the mother's life, and 30 percent who are for abortion on demand, and that leaves 60 percent who swing back and forth conditionally, depending on what trimester -LRB- of pregnancy -RRB- and what circumstances you're talking about,'' he said. The Times said other polling experts agree that more people are more likely to say they favor abortion when the question is framed in terms of a `` woman's right to choose'' than when the question talks about `` protecting an unborn child.''

 More people today say they see homeless people in their communities than did three years ago and they blame everyone from the federal government to the homeless themselves, according to a poll published Sunday. Most of the 1,533 people interviewed by telephone for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll said they wanted the government to do more and half said they would pay higher taxes to get it done. Fifty-one percent of those participating in the nationwide poll answered yes when asked if they `` personally see homeless people around your community or on the way to work.'' Three years ago, 36 percent said yes to that question. `` A lot of the blame'' for the worsening should be put on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, according to 24 percent of those surveyed. But they also assigned `` a lot'' of blame to alcohol and drug abuse by the homeless, 50 percent; to mental institutions for `` releasing patients who are n't ready to lead normal lives,'' 44 percent; the homeless themselves as being unwilling to work, 37 percent; and local governments for failing to take care of people in need, 30 percent. Sixty-five percent said they supported more federal spending on the homeless, and 49 percent of all those polled said they would pay $ 100 a year more in federal taxes toward that end. The interviews were conducted from Jan. 12 to 15. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points

 Third people were arrested and a fourth person surrendered to police Saturday in connection with a predawn arson fire that killed six people from four generations of a family, police said. A 17-year-old boy and a 22-year-old man were arrested Saturday within a few blocks of the house that was heavily damaged by fire early Friday morning. Another 17-year-old boy surrendered to police Saturday evening, said police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>. A 32-year-old man was arrested late Saturday evening, police said. No charges were immediately filed against the four, who were held in the <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, police said. Survivors of the fire said a feud with a man who allegedly ran a nearby drug house may have been the motive for the arson. The fire was discovered at 2:45 a.m. Friday by a man inside the house who went to investigate the sound of breaking glass in the first-floor living room, <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said. The fire spread quickly up the stairs to the second floor, where all six victims were found in their bedrooms. Gasoline was used to start the blaze, <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said. A nearly empty five-gallon gasoline can was found near the broken window. Preliminary reports said the six victims, who represented four generations of the family, died of smoke inhalation. The victims were identified as <PERSON> Trisha </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, 19; her baby, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 6 months; <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Addison </PERSON>, 2; <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> <PERSON> Addison </PERSON>, 2; <PERSON> Velma </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, 76, and <PERSON> Nola </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, 59.

 A proposal to increase the sales tax to finance a $ 174 million domed stadium won an easy victory in a referendum Saturday. The countywide vote for the dome was 93,091, or 53 percent, to 82,612, or 47 percent. The vote culminated an 18-month battle between city officials, businessmen and grass roots groups over the referendum, which proposed to raise the sales tax in <LOCATION> Bexar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> by a half-cent to a total 8 percent over the next five years to pay for construction of the 65,000-seat stadium. `` I think we were outspent and outadvertised. We were just outperformed,'' said a leading opponent of the project, C.A. <PERSON> Stubbs </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Homeowners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxpayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're going to go from here, no cry-baby speeches,'' <PERSON> Stubbs </PERSON> said. `` We are disappointed, but we will fight another day.'' About 31 percent of the county's 566,000 registered voters turned out for the election amid clear skies and warm weather. There are 1.2 million people in the county, which includes <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>.

 Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, who leaves office in May after eight years as mayor and six as a councilman, led the pro-dome factions that said the stadium would help the city increase its $ 1.5 billion tourism industry by luring bigger conventions and attracting new hotels. The possibility of using the stadium to attract a professional sport team was discussed, but that was overshadowed by talk of boosting convention and tourist business. `` Today is an affirmation by the people of <LOCATION> Bexar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> of the vision of the future that they want for this area and that is the real victory of what occurred today,'' <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> told about 500 supporters who had gathered at a hotel ballroom Saturday night.

Urrabazo and others said the private sector should take over financing of the proposal and said any tax increase should be used for educational programs and basic services. `` This stadium is not a vision for the future.

<TEXT>
 Solidarity on Sunday accepted a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> offer to hold talks on legalizing the outlawed trade union movement and said the negotiations should begin `` as soon as possible.'' They would be the first formal talks between Solidarity and authorities since the union was crushed in a December 1981 crackdown. Solidarity, the first independent trade union in the Soviet bloc, was outlawed a year later. Asked if the agreement between the union and authorities represented a victory, Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said: `` I am a practical man and practice will show how far Poles can go in agreement.'' His comments came during an impromptu news conference that was held after Solidarity's leadership accepted the government offer and he took a few minutes to address 5,000 people who attended a Mass at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> wore a Solidarity pin on his lapel and a tie clasp given to him by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when the American visited <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as vice president last year. The Solidarity leader, who appeared very happy, said the union could be ready within two months to hold its first nationwide congress since martial law was declared in December 1981. After the Mass, 1,000 people marched from the church chanting, `` Solidarity! Solidarity! Legalize Solidarity!'' Police blocked the procession after it had gone a few blocks and it disbanded peacefully. In a statement Sunday ending nearly two days of talks of the union's leadership, Solidarity said it is willing to respect the law and its original 1980 statute. It called on the government to respect the conventions of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> guaranteeing trade union freedoms. The decision to accept the offer for talks was adopted unanimously with one abstention of the union's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which is made up of about 20 regional leaders from across <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. On Thursday, the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> announced a new stance endorsing more than one trade union organization. The party offered to legalize Solidarity under terms to be negotiated if the union respects the law and agrees to help reform the economy. Solidarity said the government has met its conditions for beginning talks on legalizing it and on the social and economic problems facing <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` It is necessary to start negotiations as soon as possible. They should have a realistic and concrete character, and public opinion should be informed about it fully,'' the commission said. `` On our side we express the will to act according to the law and according to the statute of our union in the spirit of the superior interests of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' Solidarity called for agreement on a reform program to confront <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s `` dramatic economic, ecological and material situation.'' The statement opens the way for formal talks to begin with authorities at a talks first proposed by the government during a wave of strikes in August. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had demanded that the party make a political decision to legalize Solidarity before he would join the talks. Both sides have said they are ready to talk, and it appeared that negotiations could begin very quickly, perhaps within the next few weeks.

<TEXT>
 The document on human rights and security 35 nations approved in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> this month has narrowed the gap between East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> but widened some fissures in their alliances. Both superpowers praise the agreement, which promises broader individual freedoms and provides for new arms talks, as a herald of future disarmament successes. The ultimate success of the 27-month conference that produced the document, however, has stirred unrest within the blocs led by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. European members of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> show increasing resistance to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> views of how disarmament should proceed on their continent. <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact allies of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> demonstrate markedly different degrees of commitment to the human rights protections spelled out in the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> accord. Whether the internal divisions will develop into disabling rifts will depend in large part on the superpower leaders. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to continue <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies on disarmament, but mounting pressure from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> could produce an approach more receptive to the Kremlin. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform program has met resistance at home and in some nations of the Soviet bloc. At the moment, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> desperately needs to cut arms spending as a way of stabilizing the economy and improving the living standard. Western allies are aware of the pressure he faces and of the serious consequences for arms control if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s conservative opponents gain the upper hand. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats concede the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> conference succeeded primarily because of the Soviet reforms. Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said release of political prisoners, easing of emigration and more tolerant policies on free speech and religious practice changed the American position on the Soviet proposal for a 1991 human rights conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Agreement on a final document in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> was delayed because Western nations objected to holding such a meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The conference was one of several since 1975, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and all European nations except <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> signed the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> agreements on <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> security and cooperation. The <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> statement approved Jan. 15 proclaims the right of all citizens to assemble, speak their minds, travel, emigrate and monitor compliance of their governments. It sets ambitious goals for better trade relations and environmental protection and mandates new negotiations on reducing conventional military forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, to begin March 9 in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> for the closing session, described the agreement as the result of commitment and compromise. He said the Kremlin would disclose the numbers of its soldiers and armaments in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> before the new talks begin. Arguments and secrecy surrounding the relative strength of forces have hamstrung existing negotiations that began 15 years ago. Asked why he was so confident the new forum would avoid the pitfalls of the old, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the alliances were under increasing pressure to improve the international climate. `` It's something our peoples want and their governments, if they are true governments, should express the will of the people,'' he told reporters. In his speech to the conference, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would remove some short-range nuclear weapons from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and asked <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to negotiate withdrawal of the remaining European-based missiles with ranges of 300 miles or less. All missiles of intermediate range are being withdrawn and dismantled under an accord signed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in December 1987, and negotiators report good progress on a pact to cut stockpiles of long-range weapons. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has said repeatedly it does not want to give up short-range nuclear arms until a Soviet advantage in conventional forces is reduced. `` There's not going to be anything left except the short-range,'' a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat said. `` If we want to keep the flexible response doctrine credible, I do n't see any way we can negotiate these in the foreseeable future.'' That <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> doctrine holds that the West must retain its nuclear option until the Soviet advantage in troops, tanks, artillery and other conventional weapons is reduced. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members, however, have been chafing under that and other constraints on the pace of disarmament. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the forthcoming talks, said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> wants to see a Soviet reduction in conventional forces first, but added: `` I'm not trying to suggest there is no difference of opinion within the alliance.'' Within the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s planned pullouts are popular with the masses but worrisome for some leaderships. Even more divisive is the question of human rights and the varying degrees of willingness among the East-bloc allies to emulate the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> policies of glasnost and perestroika.

<TEXT>
 As <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> looks to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in the first days of his presidency, he will find Soviet and European leaders jostling to share the stage in the peace process that once seemed an American monopoly. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains the region's most important outside power. But it no longer holds the solo role of matchmaker it played in the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli treaty. `` I believe that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is making, can make and will make a considerable contribution ... toward this <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace settlement,'' Lord Plumb, President of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> this month. The Europeans have played a path-finding role that often has complimented American actions _ as well as channeling them. Their contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> helped both legitimize the organization and prod it toward more moderate positions that opened the way for a dialogue with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. European calls for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> compromise have underscored quieter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure on the Jewish state. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> was a crucial mediator late last year to draw the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> back into contact with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after a 13-year <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> boycott. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s embassy in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> hosted clandestine meetings to help pave the way for those talks. Its foreign minister, delegated by the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, visited <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders this month and urged them to respond to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> peace efforts. Soviet officials pressured their leftist allies in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to accept <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, renounce terrorism and endorse <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace resolutions, setting the stage for the U.S.-PLO dialogue. Both the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have improved relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, partly in expectation of a role in <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace talks. European parliamentarians and ministers have paraded through the Holy Land on political pilgrimages, lecturing irritated <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders on the need to compromise. Italian, Spanish, Greek, British, Scandinavian and East European leaders have met <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to encourage the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s shift from the gun to the conference table <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> upgraded the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to a `` general delegation'' _ a step short of diplomatic recognition. The barrage of activity led <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to accuse the European Community on Jan. 13 of a `` love affair'' with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> He insisted the community `` can not bring us closer to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. That depends only on us. They have no right to impose solutions or to apply economic pressure.'' <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s long boycott of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> eventually achieved a key aim. The organization last month embraced the moderate stands <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had demanded to help sow the seeds of a possible peace settlement. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> isolation of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> worked both ways. Its repeated efforts to find an alternative to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> were all but demolished by the 13-month-old Palestinian uprising, which evoked a storm of pro-PLO sentiment in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The policy also caused popular hostility to American policy throughout the Arab world, whose governments unanimously insist the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is central to any settlement. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was unable to get <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to agree on the U.S.-backed concept of trading occupied Arab land for peace _ the heart of all major <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts over the past 20 years. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> largely stood by as Israeli troops invaded <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and bombed <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in 1982, then reneged on a promise to protect Palestinian refugees after the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> blocked a key arms deal for <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, considered the Arab key to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace plans, infuriating King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. By 1984, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had ruled itself out as a sole peace mediator. Together with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, he embraced a Soviet-inspired call for the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to oversee Arab-Israeli peace talks. That plan eventually won broad European support as frustrated Arabs increasingly asked <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to pressure the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to influence <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> responded, keeping an eye on its major economic interests in the region and mindful of the perils of war between increasingly well-armed rivals on its southern flank.

 Here is a brief review of the political, social and economic policies of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> SOVIET </LOCATION> <LOCATION> UNION </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who gained power in March 1985, has pursued policies that enlarged personal freedoms, promoted economic change, reduced involvement in such regional conflicts as <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and took major steps in arms control. His domestic reforms are endangered by conservatives in high places; ethnic strife between Armenians and Azerbaijanis; and nationalist movements in the Baltic states of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also faces opposition because living conditions are slow to improve and conservatives see danger in disarmament.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> POLAND </LOCATION> _ Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s government has agreed to give workers a greater voice in economic decisions by offering to legalize Solidarity with some conditions. The concession seems born of frustration over inability either to stop an economic slide or inspire Poles to accept price increases and other means of financing reform.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> HUNGARY </LOCATION> _ The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact pioneer in economic and social change plans to open the first stock market in a communist country and has set the stage for a multiparty political system. It has been the most vocal of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s allies in pressing for international standards on human rights guarantees and has been tolerant of protest and unofficial groups.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 EAST <LOCATION> GERMANY </LOCATION> _ The 16 million Germans ruled by <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> have one of the bloc's most industrially productive nations but have not won the greater freedom championed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and instituted in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Restrictions on emigration and travel have been eased somewhat, but the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall remains a symbol of repression and a point of contention between East and West.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> CZECHOSLOVAKIA </LOCATION> _ Although it has the highest living standard of the seven <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> nations </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> takes one of the hardest lines on dissent and has balked at many of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s political and economic reforms Police attacks on demonstrators in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> this month have emphasized the different attitudes among Soviet allies on free expression.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> BULGARIA </LOCATION> _ The nation <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> has led 34 years is known as one of the Kremlin's most loyal followers but has been slow to embrace change. Human rights abuses and police repression are reported with increasing frequency as those advocating reform challenge the leadership.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> ROMANIA </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> runs the most repressive nation in the Soviet bloc and his attempt to rid it of foreign debt also has left <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> financially strapped. Food and power shortages have further reduced a poor standard of living. Hesitant attempts at public disagreement with the `` The Chosen One,'' as <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> is called, have met harsh response. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> said it would refuse to honor any provisions of the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> document it considered intrusive.

 Police hurling tear gas grenades battled thousands of protesters who tried to march through <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Sunday to demand the overthrow of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and the expulsion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. Dozens of the estimated 5,000 radicals were injured or detained when 6,000 riot troopers charged them, but police had no figures on injuries or arrests. The demonstrators chanting `` Yankee go home!'' and `` Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' were trying to reach the headquarters of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Troopers in green combat fatigues and black, visored helmets blocked the march and retaliated with tear gas when some protesters threw firebombs and rocks to try to force their way. The riot police charged the protesters, forcing many to flee downstairs into subway stations where some were trampled or hit by people leaping from above. Police beat and kicked groups of protesters who were surrounded by the charging security forces. Other protesters hurled scores of firebombs, and some police were beaten to the ground by radicals using clubs and fists. `` You are the enemies of our people!'' an enraged man yelled at police. Clashes continued for more than an hour along one of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s main shopping avenues. Hundreds of terrified pedestrians ran to escape the fighting and clouds of tear gas. Demonstrators repeatedly called for removal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense treaty. An effigy representing <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and top Korean industrialists was burned during the march. The rally before the march also demanded an end to controls on labor unions. The protest was the first action organized by a new dissident alliance, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> a </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which was formed Saturday by about 20 dissident, labor and student groups. Coalition leaders said it was the largest dissident group ever formed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and claimed a membership of 30,000 people. Coalition leaders pledged to seek the fall of the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government, charging it is a front for military rule. The coalition also called for an end to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s powerful industrial conglomerates and to all foreign influence. The coalition claims it will launch a movement of students, workers and farmers to remove <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and create a `` society of equality'' for workers and the poor. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bu-young </PERSON>, a leader of the new group, said, `` Since the organization is based on grass-roots groups, it will be able to resist any government oppression and struggle for national development.'' Formation of a similar dissident alliance in May 1987 was a key event in sparking major anti-government protests that forced the authoritarian government of President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> to agree to democratic presidential elections. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> won the election, and his government has introduced broad democratic reforms. Radicals refuse to accept that there have been democratic reforms and claim the nation is still ruled by the military and powerful industrialists. The radicals appear to lack substantial public support, but their violent protests make them a powerful force in domestic politics. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> warned last week that radicals were a threat to political stability and ordered a harsh crackdown.

 A magazine falsely reported results of a popularity poll to say that <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> had the highest score, state radio said. The latest edition of the popular independent weekly Reform said <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> topped the list of its `` The Year's Reform Man'' survey with 22.9 percent of nearly 5,000 votes received. Pal Emoed, a Reform editorial board member, told the radio late Saturday that `` not even'' 500 votes had arrived in the magazine office. He told the radio that of those votes, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> finished second to <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, a minister of state and leading reformer. Emoed gave no figures and did not say who was responsible for publishing the allegedly false results.

<TEXT>
 The budget director who will help write President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s fiscal 1990 spending plan gave a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee an early peek at the basic framework last week, along with acknowledgment that it will not elicit unanimous applause from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would love it if we could do something you would n't criticize,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> told members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at his confirmation hearing `` But I do n't think we'll be able to meet that test.'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, whose nomination as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> could be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this week, spent most of his five hours before the committee on Thursday fencing with Democrats eager to find holes in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign pledge of no new taxes. But the 45-year-old former investment banker, deputy treasury secretary and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide also gave some indications of what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s revisions to the budget former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presented on Jan. 9 will look like. And he gave hints as to how the new president will honor his campaign pledges to support education, research and other priorities, while grappling with the federal deficit. The administration says the imbalance would reach $ 127 billion this year without savings, well above the $ 100 billion cap set by the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. Asked about education spending, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> responded, `` You'll see a lot of emphasis on the role the federal government can play in providing leadership in regard to education.'' But in the next breath he said there would be only a `` modest increase'' in federal education spending. He suggested that, instead, the government could provoke improvements in education by other, unspecified means. He said the budget would provide tax breaks and other incentives to spur research and development. He said that in looking for savings, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would not reduce the giant Social Security program. But he said the growth of spending for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, which provides medical services for the elderly and handicapped, would be reined in. He provided no figures. Defense, which accounts for more than one-quarter of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s $ 1.15 trillion budget, will not receive the boost of 2 percent growth, above inflation, that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave it, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said Again, he offered no specifics. He insisted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s flexible freeze plan _ a brew of spending increases that rises no faster than inflation, along with no tax increases _ could reduce the deficit and eventually balance the budget. But he left the door open to retain the $ 13 billion in asset sales, user fee increases and other revenue raisers that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> inserted into his spending plan. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> insisted that none of those items can be considered taxes, a viewpoint Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are already disputing. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said the blueprint would be longer than the 12-page document submitted by President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> when he succeeded <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in 1969, but would not be as comprehensive as the six-volume budget <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> submitted earlier this month. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s document, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said, would specify `` what the particular programs are he wishes to emphasize.'' Those yet-to-come details are what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the new administration will wrestle over for months to come.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> was lauded as a breath of fresh air in the stuffy world of royal protocol when she married <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> 2 -LCB- years ago, but today the Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is known in some quarters as `` Her Royal Idleness.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s brassy tabloids also are calling her `` Duchess Dolittle'' for what they view as her love of holidays and jet-setting lifestyle. A recent scorecard listing the public engagements of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s royal family put <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant, at the bottom with only 30 last year <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> was next with 55, less than half those performed by her husband's 88-year-old grandmother, Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>. Buckingham Palace noted that <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, as a naval officer, was not expected to have other commitments and that <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> gave birth to their first child in August. But a public opinion poll published Sunday in News of the World indicated 34 percent of Britons surveyed believe the 29-year-old duchess does not earn the $ 150,000 she and her husband receive yearly from the government for royal duties. `` Her Royal Idleness,'' the newspaper's headline blared. `` Freeloading <PERSON> Fergie </PERSON> is the most unpopular member of the royal family,'' its story said. The newspaper said Market and <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> polled 501 adults last week. No margin of error was given. News about <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> and her family sells newspapers in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and the duchess has suffered her share of barbs since she first was linked to <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> more than three years ago. At first, the duchess was lauded for her breezy style and friendly, open manner. But she slowly became a target, mainly for her healthy appetite, sometimes plump figure and fashion gaffes. After an official visit to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> last March, even the serious newspapers said <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s behavior had been brash and vulgar, particularly her bold repartee with audiences. As the duchess gained weight last summer during the later months of her pregnancy, the tabloids delighted in publishing unflattering photographs of her. Criticism intensified last fall when she left her newborn baby, Princess <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>, at home with a nanny for six weeks while she went to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> on official business and holidays. The attacks reached a crescendo last week when <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> went skiing at <LOCATION> Klosters </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, where Maj. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, a close friend of the royal family, died last year in an avalanche that narrowly missed <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, heir to the throne. Critics considered the trip an excessive holiday and unseemly because it came only a year after the tragedy. The Daily Mirror, which branded <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> `` Duchess Dolittle,'' said she sobbed after daily briefings by aides on the tabloid attacks. The duchess flew to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Friday to attended a memorial service for the 34 people killed in a triple-train crash in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in December. It was one of only six public engagements she has scheduled until March, according to <ORGANIZATION> Buckingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION>'s official list. The Sunday Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, which usually does not focus on the private lives of the royal family, said the duchess was suffering from a general cooling in relations between the palace and the media. The chill is largely due to the royal family's failure to attend a memorial service in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, for victims of the Dec. 21 crash of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, and the decision to send <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> to the funeral of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. Many British veterans still consider <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> a war criminal. `` Whether the activities of the duchess are an embarrassment and a disgrace or whether she is merely fulfilling a popular need for a bete noir in the nation's most popular soap opera is debatable,'' The Sunday Times said.

 From the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to the homeless on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s streets, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left his successor a host of problems that defied resolution during his own White House years. Some problems, particularly the federal budget deficit, are manifestly worse than they were when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> inherited them from <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> during the presidential turnover eight years earlier. AIDS was unheard of in 1981, although the deadly sexually transmitted virus was already spreading through its victims. To date, it has claimed the lives of more than 46,000 Americans, and no cure is in sight. The national debt was $ 930 billion when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> moved into the Oval Office. Now, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has inherited a debt that has soared past $ 2.6 trillion and is growing at the rate of $ 155 billion a year. The trade deficit has abated from a peak of $ 170 billion in 1987, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still imports $ 11 billion more than it exports each month. The spread of homelessness across urban <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and into its suburbs has been a nagging reminder that the five-plus years of unbroken economic growth have also left some Americans behind. On the health front, 37 million Americans now have no health insurance, up from 30 million or fewer at the end of the 1970s. Most are in working class families not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid, with their breadwinners in low-paying jobs that offer few fringe benefits like health insurance. Health care costs were soaring much faster than the general rate of inflation when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office, and they are still hurtling forward. Efforts by the government's <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid programs as well as private insurers such as <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to demand more efficiency from hospitals and physicians had mixed results. The nation pays more than $ 500 billion for health care, or 11.2 percent of its gross national product _ far more than any other nation _ but ranks 19th in the world on infant mortality. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> accelerated a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> buildup that <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had begun, but it came to halt midway through his second term, and now <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is faced with the task of cutting the military's spending plans by $ 200 billion or more over the next several years. Among the most expensive military plans is <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, which will cost far more than the current research budget of $ 4 billion-plus if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> makes good on his promise to press ahead with the research and ultimately deploy the space-based shield against nuclear attack. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made political hay during the campaign over Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' opposition to both a mobile MX and the Midgetman missile, he acknowledged after the election that the nation probably can not afford both modernized land missiles and that his defense secretary, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, will have a painful choice to make. The problems of the savings and loan industry, which the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> says may cost $ 112 billion to fix, have landed on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lap. Even with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s bailouts of 217 sick S & amp; Ls there are still 350 insolvent S & amp; Ls and 150 others nearing the brink. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says it will cost up to $ 128 billion over the next two decades to clean up nuclear arms plants and research facilities, a problem which only in recent months has worked its way into the public consciousness. The only three reactors capable of producing tritium, a vital ingredient in the nation's nuclear arms stockpile, have been shut down by safety problems. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left office with nine Americans still hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 before Christmas, with the loss of 270 lives, dramatized that terrorism remains a scourge on the world scene. Despite a late opening of talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, little progress was made under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> toward bringing the nations in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> together toward a peaceful resolution of their long, deep-seated hostilities. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his successor, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, can point to such positive developments in the past year as the cease fire in the Iran-Iraq war, the Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and a U.S.-engineered settlement in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> put an end to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the Contras in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and the Sandinista government there no longer faces sustained attacks from the anti-communist rebels. A solution to the problem of staggering Third World debts, much of it owed by Latin nations to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks, eluded <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary. Now, as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s secretary of state, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> again will be faced with the problem of how to promote prosperity among the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> neighbors to the south. Many experts fear that the hemisphere's turn away from dictatorships and toward democratic institutions will be reversed if interest on the debts continues to sap the economies of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

 Thousands of Oklahomans converged on Penn Square Mall and formed a `` snake-like'' line, but it was n't a conga dance festival and nobody was fighting for a chance to buy some incredible bargains.

 Rain and snow wetted drought-stricken northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> on Sunday, but only a few raindrops fell on most of <LOCATION> Sardinia </LOCATION>, rainless for 11 months, and Alpine ski resorts still face a disastrous season. Farmers in the northern <LOCATION> Po </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> said last week that rice, wheat and barley harvests would fail if rain did not fall this month. Ski resorts in the <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> region in the northwest <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alps </LOCATION> announced earlier this month they are seeking government reimbursement for $ 115 million in lost tourist revenue. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> ended his noon prayers to a crowd in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Square by adding: `` Let's greet this rain with gratitude.'' Meteorologists predicted skies would clear Monday. Rain began Saturday night on the southern end of <LOCATION> Sardinia </LOCATION>. The rest of the island off central <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> barely got wet, and Sunday dawned sunny. RAI state television reported that congregations prayed for rain in services Sunday around the island. Sardinian reservoirs had a two-month supply of drinking water left. Cloud seeding to induce rain has been under consideration and several cities have limited water use. The island wants <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to declare it a natural disaster area and is seeking $ 692 million worth of aid. Sheep have nibbled bare most of their grazing areas. Agricultural officials say the artichoke harvest was hurt by the drought and that tomato and beet crops could be too. Farmers say the drought rivals the disastrous dry spell on the island in 1812. Snow fell in the <LOCATION> Valle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> d'Aosta </LOCATION> area for about four hours Sunday morning, said <PERSON> Giulia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ianacone </PERSON>, of the Alpine ski area's information office. `` The snow was not heavy and there was little accumulation,'' she said, speaking by telephone. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> reported that a few lifts on the valley's slopes were reopened but they appeared likely to close again because the snowfall was melting rapidly under a strong noon sun. State television reported two inches of snow fell Sunday on <LOCATION> Courmayeur </LOCATION>, a popular resort near the French and Swiss borders. Eastern Alpine areas reported no snow. Before Sunday, the last snowfall in the <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alps </LOCATION> occurred in early December, when an average of eight inches fell. The snowless holidays forced some resort owners to reimburse angry skiers who had paid in advance for vacations. Mild temperatures made the use of artificial snow-makers impractical, and some international cross-country races scheduled for mid-January were canceled.

 The pullout by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 has proved to be a windfall for the South African executives who took over the company, according to survey published Sunday. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, the South African-owned firm formed when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carmaker left, was rated `` the biggest success story'' among 16 corporations formed in a similar fashion and surveyed by a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> newspaper, The Sunday Star. Since <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> has expanded its work force by 600 and returned to profitability following five years of losses through 1986, according to the survey. Sales have increased from 24,000 units in 1986 to 40,000 in 1988, the survey said. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s personnel director, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stegmann </PERSON>, was quoted as saying employees considered <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> a better employer than <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and had staged no strikes or work stoppages since the change. According to <PERSON> Stegmann </PERSON>, 67 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s work force is black or mixed-race, compared to 62 percent under <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stegmann </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> was continuing to invest in social programs but was aiming these more at its work force than <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> did. He was quoted as saying <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s social programs were financed directly from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> headquarters `` irrespective of the business performance of the local subsidiary, translating into vast amounts of money being disbursed to external social projects at times when employees were being retrenched.'' `` Employers found it difficult to understand why so much was done for others when their own needs were not addressed,'' <PERSON> Stegmann </PERSON> was quoted as telling the Star. Executives of other companies surveyed by the newspaper also reported that the effects of disinvestment had been positive. Roughly 150 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies have withdrawn from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the past four years, generally citing economic factors or pressure from the anti-apartheid movement. In most cases, the operations were taken over by white South African managers.

 Former Ugandan dictator <PERSON> Idi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>, who angered <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> authorities by slipping out of the country, will be allowed to return and resume his life in exile, an authoritative Saudi source said Sunday. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said King <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> was acting in response to requests by unidentified African leaders. He refused to say whether <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> had returned or whether a date had been fixed for that. The African leaders reportedly included <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, who has close ties with the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> monarch, and President <PERSON> Mobuto </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seku </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>, 61, was ousted from his east African nation in 1979 and was granted political asylum in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> in 1980. He slipped out of the desert kingdom on a forged passport and surfaced in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION>, the Zairean capital, with one of his sons on Jan. 13. <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> immediately demanded <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>'s extradition to stand trial for the death of tens of thousands of his political opponents during the eight years of his tyrannical rule. Newspaper reports alleged <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> also practiced cannibalism, but these reports have not been independently verified. Following his arrival in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> deported him to <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> so that he could catch a flight back to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. But the <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> authorities sent <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> back to <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> authorities refused to take him back because of his abuse of their hospitality. An <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> diplomat said the former dictator has long been unpopular with his Saudi hosts for meddling in African politics and for his links with personalities opposed to the Ugandan government. On Jan. 18, a report from <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION> said he had been deported again and was returning to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. However, there has been no official confirmation of his return, and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> officials have refused to comment on all aspects of the story. People in the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION> said they could not say whether he had returned to his residence there, a guarded remote villa outside the city.

 Two years after burning bodies were found in a ceramics factory's kilns, members of a prominent family who ran a mortuary face trial for alleged mass cremations and removal of organs and gold from corpses. The case has conjured up Holocaust-like images of bodies packed into ovens and produced preliminary testimony that one member of the family was called `` <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'' by his employees and engaged in strongarm tactics. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sconce </PERSON>, 32, and his parents, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sconce </PERSON>, 55, and <LOCATION> Laurieanne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lamb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sconce </LOCATION>, 52, are accused of 67 counts including multiple cremation of human remains and unlawful removal of body parts from human remains. They deny the charges. Their trial was scheduled to begin Monday but <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Glidden </PERSON> said Friday it is expected to be postponed because attorneys have other case commitments. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sconce </PERSON> on Friday was ordered to stand trial by himself on one count of conspiracy to murder the owner of a cremation society that Sconce once wanted to take over. Ms. <PERSON> Glidden </PERSON> said she will seek to consolidate the two cases. The scandal has already produced a state law allowing crematory inspection on demand. And lawsuits have been filed against 100 mortuaries that used the Sconces' cremation service on behalf of families of 17,000 decedents cremated between March 1983 and December 1986. The case involves the Lamb Funeral Home, was founded in 1929 by Mrs. <PERSON> Sconce </PERSON>'s grandfather; <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cremations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of which <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sconce </PERSON> was president, and <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eye </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tissue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Coastal Cremations charged other mortuaries only $ 55 per cremation and sought business widely as the use of cremation boomed in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. On Jan. 20, 1987, authorities in <LOCATION> Hesperia </LOCATION> responded to complaints of odors at <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sconce </PERSON>'s Oscar Ceramics plant in the desert and found burning bodies in its furnaces and cans of human ashes. The investigation led to shocking testimony. Officials alleged the mortuary and tissue bank removed and sold gold teeth plus brains, bones, corneas and other organs without consent of next-of-kin; embezzlement of interest from prepaid funeral trust accounts; illegal cremation of more than one body at a time, and comingling of ashes. It is a felony to dismember human corpses in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and a misdemeanor for crematoriums to burn bodies together without the permission of survivors. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, a driver for the crematory from 1983 to December 1985, testified at one hearing that <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sconce </PERSON> paid to have funeral directors beaten, pried gold teeth from corpses and boasted of the number of bodies he could burn at one time. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said he and two others divided $ 750 for attacking the directors, whom <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sconce </PERSON> feared would publish allegations of multiple cremations in an industry magazine. `` He wanted them messed up and hospitalized,'' said the witness, who has pleaded guilty to assault. He said he often saw as many as a dozen bodies in the crematory retorts, or ovens. `` I looked at it as <PERSON> gore </PERSON>. It was sickening,'' he said. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sconce </PERSON> sometimes spoke about setting records for stacking bodies. `` It was over 13 and the old records were continually being broken,'' he said. He told of holding a flashlight while <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sconce </PERSON> pulled gold teeth from the mouths of a dozen corpses, and said he once saw him smash a corpse's jaw with a crowbar to get at gold teeth. The prosecution has not calculated the number of bodies that allegedly were handled illegally by Lamb. `` They were cremating like 8,000 bodies a year,'' she said, and multiple cremations were conducted on a daily basis.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on Sunday rejected a proposal for limited self-rule for Palestinians in the occupied territories and elections to choose peace negotiators. `` It is n't worth the trouble to reply to these proposals, which have been rejected even by Palestinian children,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told a group of reporters. `` It is a new attempt to get out of the bottleneck in which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has found itself.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief was in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> for a meeting of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders involved with the 13-month uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. A peace plan proposed last week by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> calls for a period of limited self-rule for Palestinians in the territories, followed by a three-way confederation of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> also said if the Palestinians halted the uprising, they could hold elections to choose peace negotiators. Other Palestinian leaders also have rejected the plan, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> says was <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s private proposal. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON>, also rejected it, <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>'s daily <ORGANIZATION> Ad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dustour </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON> was quoted as saying `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is required to withdraw from the Arab lands they occupied in 1967, then to give the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> an opportunity to set up their <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>.'' Earlier Sunday in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> called on `` Arab kings, presidents and princes'' to rally in support of the revolt. He said the uprising will continue `` until our people establish their own independent state with <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as its capital,'' according to a statement issued in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> by the Palestinian news agency <ORGANIZATION> WAFA </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> of stepping up repression in the occupied territories in an attempt to halt the rebellion. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> spoke surrounded by members of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> executive committee and several <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders he said had traveled from the occupied territories. He said he was chairing meetings to discuss `` means of escalating resistance'' in response to tougher Israeli measures to crack down on the uprising. Last week, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> announced a policy that allows troops to fire plastic bullets more freely at stone-throwers and Palestinians setting up roadblocks. The rules also call for destroying the homes of suspected stone-throwers. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he will ask western European nations to play a greater role in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts when he meets the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> on Friday. He also said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is seeking a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to discuss the situation in the occupied territories. Arab newspapers, meanwhile, reported efforts to arrange a meeting between Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, who last month renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> subsequently dropped its 13-year ban on talking with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhabi </PERSON>'s state-run daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> invited <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to visit the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to pave the way for an international peace conference on the region. The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s `` intensive current efforts with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are aimed at arranging a meeting between <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> during that tour.''

<HEAD>Thornburgh `Guesses' Court Will Overturn Landmark Abortion Decision</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, speaking on the 16th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s landmark decision legalizing abortion, said Sunday it was his `` guess'' that the court would reverse itself this year and allow states to outlaw abortion. Should that happen, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he would support prosecution of those involved in illegal abortions, but he was not specific and did not answer directly when asked whether he would favor prosecution of women who illegally terminated a pregnancy. Sunday was the anniversary of the Jan. 22, 1973, decision in <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> but many of the annual demonstrations by anti-abortion and pro-choice groups marking the decision were scheduled for Monday. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is scheduled to speak by telephone to a Monday march organized by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made several such calls during his administration. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last year agreed to review a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case in which a lower federal court struck down as unconstitutional a stringent state anti-abortion law. In its appeal, the state urged reversal of <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration filed a brief calling the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case an `` appropriate opportunity'' to reconsider the 1973 decision. `` I think what we have to look for is what kind of approach the court takes if they do overturn <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> program `` Meet the Press.'' `` My guess is that they will return the regulation of abortions, like many health and safety questions, to the states.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he was `` not predicting'' the outcome of the case and characterized his comments as `` strictly a guess.'' But he also said the administration was confident it would prevail in the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> vs. Reproductive Health Services. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> is the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> state attorney general. Asked about possible prosecutions in the event the high court reversed <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said those decisions would have to be made at the state level. But he added: `` I think the key is that there are certain classes of abortion that would be beyond the class of being legally able to be carried out and this would call for prosecution.'' He did not answer directly when asked if he personally favored prosecution of women who illegally obtained abortions, saying again that such decisions would be made by states. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> defended the administration's position on abortion when asked whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had considered polls showing that a majority of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> believe a woman should have the right to choose abortion. `` You want to follow public opinion where you can but there are also matters of principle involved and these are matters that the president feels strongly about,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> most recently reaffirmed <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> Vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> in 1983 but the current court is viewed as deeply divided on the issue. Its two most junior justices, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, both conservatives appointed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, have not voted in an abortion decision.

 White House national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said Sunday it would be `` premature'' to arrange a high-level <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration meeting with <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> until <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s intentions are more clearly known. Scowcroft's comments came amid <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> press reports that spoke of intensifying Arab efforts to arrange a meeting between <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, and Secretary of State-designate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. `` We already have established discussions with Chairman <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, and it seems to me we ought to explore and probe what he sees as the evolution of this,'' Scowcroft said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' He noted that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> decided to resume contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> because <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> came around to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> view on recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. `` What has happened in our changed policy toward <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is not a new <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> initiative,'' Scowcroft said. `` The chairman could've had that at any time since 1975. Then he decided to do what he finally did. Now, it seems to me, we find out what it is he has in mind.'' Asked specifically about the desirability of a meeting between <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said: `` I think it would be premature to meet at such a high level until we have a better indication of where Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> may be going.'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhabi </PERSON>'s state-run daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has extended an invitation to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to visit the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to pave the way for an international peace conference. Quoting unidentified sources in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, the newspaper said <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s `` intensive current efforts with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are aimed at arranging a meeting between <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> during that tour. The Saudi Arabian newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Madina </ORGANIZATION> also quoted unnamed sources as saying consultations were under way to prepare an Arafat-Baker meeting in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> in mid-February. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration broke a 13-year ban on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> last month. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the decision was based on a public statement by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renouncing terrorism in all forms and accepting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> revealed last week that a second, more informal `` contact'' with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had been made in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> on Jan. 17. The department also released a partial transcript of a tape recording in which <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> vowed to shoot anyone who tried to stem Palestinian unrest on the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said last month that talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would be suspended if <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> reneged on his renunciation of terrorism. On another issue, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said suspected poison gas plants in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> pose a very serious problem, but he declined to say whether the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would endorse use of force to knock them out. `` They are a terrible problem. And it is a problem akin in its scope to that of nuclear proliferation, because these weapons _ especially in city attacks, anti-population attacks _ can be every bit as devastating as nuclear weapons,'' he said. Scowcroft noted that `` they are much harder to control, because the plants to produce them are in many cases like pharmaceutical plants, like insecticide plants.'' He was questioned about whether it would be more serious to use force against such chemical weapons plants or to let them go into production. `` Sometimes one has to make a choice between undesirable alternatives,'' Scowcroft replied. But he added: `` I'm not about to make that choice now.''

 The federal government will expand its role in investigating alleged insider trading and other fraud in the nation's securities and commodities markets, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said Sunday. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the `` beefed-up'' federal role would include new task forces established specifically to focus on `` fraud and insider dealing in both the securities and commodities markets.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, interviewed on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program `` Meet the Press,'' declined to be specific about a current investigation of the world's two largest futures exchanges, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> But he indicated authorities were preparing to submit evidence to a grand jury. `` Obviously, I ca n't discuss in detail what's a pending investigation,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` I do n't want to, obviously, make any predictions. But the investigation is far-reaching, it is significant. ... We will be gathering and submitting evidence to see if violations of the federal criminal laws have occurred.'' Asked when such a review might take place, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said: `` You can never put a timetable on that, I'm afraid.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> reportedly has been investigating alleged fraud by traders at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> exchanges for the past two years. The investigation centers on allegations investors were cheated out of millions of dollars and reportedly has included the use of wiretaps to record conversations with traders suspected of fraud. While avoiding specifics about the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> promised an expanded federal role in such investigations. `` We'll be announcing soon a much beefed-up operation in this regard because it's basically a pro-consumer initiative,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` People who trade on these markets are entitled to their integrity.'' He was not specific about the composition or duties of the planned task forces or about when the announcement of their establishment would be made. Word of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> investigation surfaced the same week that the federal prosecutor widely associated with insider-trading investigations on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, announced he was resigning. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will appoint a successor. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Republican Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> has recommended criminal defense attorney <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Obermaier </PERSON>, despite objections from <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. Presidents traditionally accept the recommendation of the senior state senator from their party. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s objections stem from <PERSON> Obermaier </PERSON>'s representation of several firms that are or have been targets of insider-trading investigations. `` Those are choices that are made by the president and they would be made only after careful scrutiny of the individual's qualifications to serve and carry out the president's agenda,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said when asked whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would accept <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>'s

 The Communist Party's decision to reverse a seven-year stand against Solidarity offers the possibility of a compromise unprecedented in the history of the Communist bloc. For the first time, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders have offered to negotiate with an independent, popular opposition movement on the structure of political and social freedoms affecting the entire society. Unlike 1980 talks with Solidarity, authorities now openly say they want to discuss ways to legalize opposition to the government and to institutionalize a parliamentary opposition that would transform the party-dominated system. The talks would cover trade unions, Solidarity's first goal. But the subjects of other independent associations and clubs, elections, freedom of the press and constitutional changes also are expected at talks on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future. Even the normally skeptical Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> seemed impressed and said he was surprised by the document on trade union and political freedoms issued after a tumultuous party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting last week. `` It has never happened in the party before. It will mean breaking the monopoly -LRB- on power -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said of the document's strong endorsement of economic, political and social pluralism Solidarity's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday agreed the government's expression of willingness to legalize the trade union federation removed the last obstacle to talks with authorities. A Solidarity spokesman said the talks should start `` very soon.'' But much skepticism remains in Solidarity ranks, based on past experience. The union had a signed agreement with the government in August 1980 guaranteeing its right to exist. But the accord proved meaningless when Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> called out his troops and interned thousands of Solidarity members in a Dec. 13, 1981, crackdown. Now there are suspicions the government wants a new accord only to calm a huge wave of public unrest that appears to be building after yet another year of steep inflation and constant shortages. Polish living standards dropped sharply in the early 1980s and still have not climbed back to the level of a decade ago. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> warned in a television debate in November that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is in danger of falling further and further behind the rest of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He argues for labor calm because widespread strikes would harm the economy. At the same time, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> stresses that the union must have the right to strike and says he will not sign any agreement at the cost of Solidarity's independence. A government source demanding anonymity said authorities are counting on Solidarity to keep the peace and expressed confidence that if the union and authorities form a partnership, they will keep factories calm and give planned economic reforms a chance to work. <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON>, Solidarity's national spokesman, said Sunday the union `` will not be pushed into the role of the police or a fire brigade'' to put out strikes. But he added, `` We want to discuss economic reform. ... If it works then there will be no need to make a general strike.'' The dramatic change of course by Polish authorities can be explained in several ways. In addition to the specter of strikes larger than the two waves of labor unrest that shocked authorities last year, there has been a growing consensus _ encouraged by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s powerful <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> _ that the country will never move forward without compromise between the government and opposition Some credit must go to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s performance on a nationwide television debate in November. While coming out strongly for reinstating Solidarity, he convinced authorities he is a responsible leader not seeking to plunge <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> into confrontation. Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said the government's polling data after the debate showed a significant increase in support for both the government and Solidarity This was not paradoxical, he said. Agreement could prove a popular and beneficial policy for both sides. Among rank-and-file Solidarity activists, there is eagerness to get started again. `` Everyone is ready for it,'' said <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Durzynski </PERSON>, a union member from Solidarity's birthplace, the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. `` It wo n't be necessary to create Solidarity anew, simply to reactivate it.''

 In 1948, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON> shocked and fascinated Americans by telling them what was going on in their own bedrooms. Four decades later, the hot topic at the now world-famous <ORGANIZATION> Kinsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> has shifted from the bedroom to the boardroom. <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON>, the sex research center's high-profile, column-writing director, has been asked to resign. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where the institution is located and which provides some of its funding, last month called for her to step down, saying she has managed the institute poorly and failed to conduct enough research in her 6 -LCB- years there. <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON> refuses to step down, calling the charges groundless. She also maintains that only the institute's 10-member board of trustees, on which she sits, can tell her to resign. The institution is incorporated separately from the university, though five of the board members are university employees. `` The institute does not just belong to <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON> said. `` We're a national and international institute. We belong to the public.'' <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON> and the university are stalemated, with the board of trustees waiting for her to decide whether she will resign. No deadline was given. In the meantime, <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON> said she is trying to conduct business as usual at the institute, founded in 1947 by <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> zoologist who studied the gall wasp before turning his research to human sexuality. There are no signs to let the public know the institute even exists on the university campus, or that inside its walls are housed thousands of pieces of erotic art. Its library includes 75,000 volumes and sexually-oriented material including cartoons, stag films, fetish objects, condoms and prison art. <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON>, 45, continues to write her syndicated column, The Kinsey Report, which appears in newspapers nationwide and deals with topics ranging from sexual fantasy to menopause. But <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON> also said she spends a large part of the day on the telephone discussing her situation with an attorney. She has written a 100-page-plus rebuttal to a university review committee's critical report, which led to the call for her resignation. Other developments have added to the chaos: _ Last fall, the institute's three librarians left abruptly during a renovation of the library Their departure forced the library to close; it has not reopened. _ Following the review committee's report, the institute's former director, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gebhard </PERSON>, severed ties with it and criticized library cutbacks made after the library's part-time staff was replaced with the full-time librarians `` Frankly, it pains me to see journal subscriptions cut and other austerity measures taken in the library while money is spent on carpets, drapes, brass lighting fixtures and similar non-essentials,'' he said. <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON> said the renovation money came from separate funds that she asked the university to set aside as a condition of her accepting the $ 79,000-a-year job, not from research funds. She came from <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, where she was a psychology professor. `` You ca n't have an internationally known center that looks like an attic,'' she said. _ A major fund-raiser planned for February in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON>, a trustee and wife of comedian <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON>, was postponed because of the uncertainty over <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON>'s position Exactly why some want to get rid of <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON> remains unclear, aside from the complaints about her management style and research efforts. <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON>, `` A lot of the discussions and a lot of the testimony _ most of it _ and a lot of the letters that the committee has collected, all in fact, have been done under the promise of confidentiality.'' <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowengrub </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and the official who called for her resignation, has declined to comment. A review two years before <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON> was hired found the institute `` in drastic need of reorganization,'' the Herald-Times of <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> reported. A faculty committee found the institute `` must come closer to achieving its scholarly objectives'' to warrant continued university support, and it recommended hiring a new director. <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON> defends her work, noting that she brought with her more than $ 800,000 in research money and obtained a grant for more than $ 700,000 three years later. She lists at least 15 publications since 1982 of which she was the primary author. <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON> contends <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON>, who died in 1956, would be pleased by her leadership. `` I've really thought of him all the time and tried to do the kinds of things that I thought he would do or that he would like to have done at this point because, of course, today is not 40 years ago,'' she said.

 A top <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official announced that <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> will retain a rule barring elderly cardinals from electing new popes, a source said Sunday. The rule has reportedly caused dissension among cardinals. The <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Monsignor </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardinals </ORGANIZATION>, said in a letter to the cardinals the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> is keeping the rule enacted by his predecessor, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON>. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION>, in a report on the letter, said <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON> noted at recent meetings of cardinals that there has been open criticism about the rule, which bars cardinals 80 years and older from voting for new popes. Other news reports Sunday said <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON>'s announcement came in response to a letter to the pope signed by 10 cardinals asking for a change in the rule. However, several of the 10 cardinals named in the reports denied signing such a letter. Such a letter would be unusual since it would be a formal display of dissent at the top of the church hierarchy. After the pontiff, cardinals come next in the hierarchy of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. There are currently 156 cardinals, of whom 119 are under 80. In 1970, Pope <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON> withdrew from cardinals 80 years or older the right to elect popes and hold <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> office. He hoped to rejuvenate the <LOCATION> Roman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Curia </LOCATION> _ the central offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> _ and the secret conclaves of cardinals that elect the pope to replace a deceased one The change has been a source of criticism since by some cardinals. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> Adn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kronos </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that 10 cardinals had signed a letter asking for a change in the law, and the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Corriere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> della </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sera </ORGANIZATION> said it had confirmed the report. However, <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday said it contacted four of the cardinals named by the agency and they denied signing any such letter. One of the four cited by <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION>, Cardinal <PERSON> Corrado </PERSON> <PERSON> Bafile </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he had not signed a letter about the age limit. He said that the reports `` are not true, at least on this point.'' He would not elaborate. Cardinal <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Oddi </PERSON> was quoted as saying in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION> newspaper that he did n't sign any such letter because `` no one asked me to. But, sincerely, I would have signed it without hesitation.'' He was further quoted as saying: `` If a person is fully lucid and capable of reason why forbid him from voting?''

<TEXT>
 Calls for a ban on private ownership of semiautomatic military weapons in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> have risen strikingly since one was used in <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> in a schoolyard attack that killed five children. The state attorney general and several lawmakers hope to pass legislation while Californians are still stunned by the killings and the wounding of 29 other children and a teacher last week by a man firing an AK-47 assault rifle. `` These kinds of weapons are available to anyone who wants to buy them,'' said Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>. `` All one needs is a warm smile and cold cash. This is madness and this has to stop. We have to ban these weapons from going in the streets of our city and state.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberti </PERSON> urged Californians to `` write, talk, call on talk radio, call their legislators, demand, scream, pressure, intimidate'' in favor of a ban. At the request of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> may take up a resolution calling for a ban on paramilitary weapons such as the Soviet-designed AK-47. Agnos himself was wounded by a gunman in one of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s infamous Zebra attacks 15 years ago. The group agreed to have a subcommittee consider the resolution in February, said <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>' press secretary, <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. The resolution would only be advisory in nature. `` If urban mayors and police chiefs across the country unite behind a grass-roots demand that sale of assault weapons be halted, I am convinced we can make our voices heard in the nation's statehouses and the halls of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said The efforts are being met with vigorous opposition by staunch pro-gun advocates such as H.L. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, a national director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and founder of Gun Owners of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` The real question is how a nut like that with his background can be walking around on the street. Why do n't we go after the criminal for a change?'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said of the <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> gunman, drifter <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, who killed himself after the assault on the schoolyard. <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> had both a criminal record and a history of mental problems. He bought the AK-47 at a gun shop in <LOCATION> Sandy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, in August. All he had to do was fill out a form and pay for it. No waiting period was required. <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> could have bought the rifle in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as well. Under the law, law, anyone 18 years old or older with a driver's license can purchase a rifle. There is no waiting period and nothing preventing felons or those with a history of mental problems from buying rifles. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said he owns a semiautomatic weapon. `` I use it for hunting turkey in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It is also a very good varmint firearm. Very accurate.'' Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, asked if he would support a ban on the weapons if passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, said he would first `` want to review the whole issue very carefully.'' `` But I, just for the life of me, can not see why anybody who is going to use a gun just for sporting purposes would want or need to have a military assault type weapon,'' he added. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said he would support a requirement that rifle and shotgun buyers wait 15 days for a background check before obtaining one of the weapons. The state currently has such a delay on the sale of handguns. `` I do n't think that anybody who has got a known record in terms of criminal activity or somebody who has had mental problems _ I do n't have any problem with preventing those individuals from getting possession of any gun,'' <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said. The attorney general's proposed legislation will offer a definition of a semiautomatic assault weapon and specify some brands, all of which would be banned, said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Iglehart </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s chief assistant district attorney and a member of a task force created by <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> to address the problem. But Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he was `` not terribly optimistic'' that lawmakers will do anything about gun control. `` Every day that we move away from the Stockton-type incident, the legislative will to do something in that area will be reduced,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said.

 Officials plan to investigate police actions during a white supremacist march that drew bricks and bottles from angry counterdemonstrators, but the city's top policeman believes there were no major problems. The city response to Saturday's march by a handful of <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> followers `` was as good as we could make it,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Napper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s commissioner of public safety. But he said some allegations would be looked into, including reports of officers clubbing and arresting uninvolved spectators while trying to control the angry crowds. `` Obviously, there were some incidents, but I thought by and large we avoided anything major. This city has a legacy to work things out. ... I think that's why we have n't had the kind of situations that took place in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>,'' he said referring to last week's riots there. Police reported 42 arrests in the confrontation between the half-dozen white supremacist marchers and the hundreds of counterdemonstrators. Hospital officials said they treated 13 people, including police officers, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and counterdemonstrators, for minor injuries. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was quiet Sunday. Parts of the march route were still littered with bricks, boards, broken bottles, rocks and chunks of concrete hurled at the marchers and the police and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> members protecting them. In all, an estimated 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> members and state and local police were mobilized in what appeared at first to be a striking case of overkill. But <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, which is heavily black, houses several colleges and universities and has a sizable counterculture community _ all potential sources of participants for countering a white supremacist march. Counterdemonstrators and bystanders, estimated at between 1,000 and 3,000, overwhelmed police lines along parts of the route, charged toward the marchers and hurled objects. `` The city invited this kind of thing'' by issuing the white supremacists a march permit, charged <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathiowetz </PERSON>, a member of the Ad <ORGANIZATION> Hoc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> the Klan. <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, another counterdemonstrator, said the rock-throwers `` are just as bad as the Klan. People have to stand up to the Klan, but there has to be some peaceful way. This is a war zone.'' <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, and his handful of followers sang and shouted anti-Martin Luther King slogans along the route of about two miles. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> attempted the march on the eve of last July's Democratic National Convention, but the city canceled his permit when hundreds of counterdemonstrators massed at the Capitol and police feared violence. He said Saturday's march was a restaging of the earlier effort as well as a repudiation of King, whom he called a tyrant and a sexual pervert, and of the national holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> declined to say if he would try to march again in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` I have just begun to fight,'' he said. After the march, <PERSON> Napper </PERSON> went to Five Points, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s central downtown intersection, where at least 1,000 mostly black youths remained assembled, watched by scores of police on horseback or in riot control gear. <PERSON> Napper </PERSON>, who like most of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s top law enforcement officials is black, was pelted with questions and insults asking why <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>'s group was allowed to march and was given protection `` You protect the Klan but you wo n't protect us. You ai n't my commissioner,'' one woman screamed. `` You're protecting people who will lynch my grandchildren,'' yelled another. <PERSON> Napper </PERSON>, who broke out of the crowd with police help, said: `` They are entitled to protection. It's not always easy.''

 A meeting of more than 900 people Sunday nominated <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> for a seat on the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies representing <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, an activist said The nomination puts the human rights activist, physicist and Nobel Peace Prize winner on an electoral collision course with former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Communist Party leader <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and a powerful Politburo member. It also gives him two nominations in the upcoming elections _ one as a candidate representing <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Oktyabr </LOCATION> district, which was made last week, and one as a candidate for the entire capital. Sunday's nomination came at a meeting organized by the Memorial group, said <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON>. Memorial is a group formed in memory of victims of dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON>, a participant in the meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Filmmakers </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s north side, said a member of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> informed the meeting three other candidates so far had been nominated for the same seat. They include <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the still-popular former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss who was sacked by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in November 1987 because of his management style; and <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorotnikov </PERSON>, the president of the Russian republic and a full member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION>. About 500 people pressed outside the Filmmakers' building, unable to get into the 3 -LCB- - hour meeting that was hastily organized by Memorial on Friday, said <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON>, a member of the meeting's accounting <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said 970 people raised pink cards to nominate <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> unanimously and that he accepted. Memorial is not officially recognized and thus does not have the right to nominate candidates, but the meeting was of a group of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> voters rather than a meeting of Memorial. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies will consist of 2,250 members, two-thirds elected on the basis of geographical districts and one-third from <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, trade union, professional and social organizations. It will choose more than 400 of its members to form a new, more active Supreme Soviet Parliament. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, 67, appeared at Sunday's meeting to read a platform he originally presented to his institute colleagues Friday and to answer questions, <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said. His platform calls for release of all prisoners of conscience, freedom of association, more military cutbacks and economic reforms. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was rejected as a candidate by the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> last week, causing an angry protest by his co-workers at the <ORGANIZATION> Lebedev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION>. They then nominated him as a candidate from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Oktyabr </LOCATION> district. If elected from the Oktyabr region, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> would hold one of 24 seats from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. If elected to the Supreme Soviet, he would be a member of the Soviet of the Union, the house in the Supreme Soviet whose representatives are elected on the basis of geographical districts. If elected on the basis of the nomination Sunday, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> would represent all of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and be a member of the Soviet of Nationalities in the Supreme Soviet, which will provide representation in the highest legislative body for all of the more than 100 ethnic groups that make up the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s nomination now goes to an electoral commission that will select the candidates to actually be placed before voters March 26. It could put forward all of those nominated, but it also could reduce the number to only one. No date has been set for its meeting.

 Authorities suspect a West German company shipped equipment to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that could be used to make chemical weapons, a prosecutor said Sunday. <LOCATION> Darmstadt </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brand </PERSON> said documents seized from offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Preussag </ORGANIZATION> company of <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> indicate it shipped containers and other equipment to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that `` with relative certainty, could have been used in the production of chemical weapons.'' Brand spoke in an interview broadcast by Hamburg-based <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> TV network. It is not against West German law to ship <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> industrial goods. The legal issue is whether the company knew the consignments would be used to produce chemical weapons. The documents, some seized in 1987, also indicate the company delivered specialized equipment to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that could be used to produce poison gas shells and bombs, he said. No charges have been filed, <PERSON> Brand </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Preussag </ORGANIZATION>'s administrative offices in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Darmstadt </LOCATION> were closed Sunday, and company officials could not be reached for comment. Brand's office is investigating three other West German companies in connection with sales to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The prosecutor has jurisdiction in the case because <ORGANIZATION> Preussag </ORGANIZATION> owns a subsidiary near southern <LOCATION> Darmstadt </LOCATION>. Brand last week named two of the companies, <ORGANIZATION> Karl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kolb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GmbH </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the now-defunct Pilot Plant company. He refused to name the third company under investigation. Brand said his allegations are based on `` preliminary evaluations'' and investigations are continuing to determine whether export laws have been broken. Investigators are focusing on a West German law that requires an export license to ship arms, hazardous substances or components that can be used to produce them. In addition, a wide-ranging law forbids such exports to areas of conflict. Other news reports have linked West German technicians and scientists to production of biological weapons in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The West German government has said it has indications such a plant may operate in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> but no evidence of German participation. Brand's comments came as controversy continued over alleged involvement by West German companies in such sales to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. At least two West German companies are under criminal investigation in connection with a suspected Libyan chemical weapons factory, and investigators are investigating a Munich-based company suspected of helping <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> develop the capability to refuel warplanes in flight. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials contend the Libyan factory in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, is designed to produce poison gas. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says the facility will manufacture pharmaceuticals. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials received a crucial clue about the <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> plant's operations after the deaths of wild dogs in the Libyan desert. The newspaper said a toxic spill of chemical wastes at the site last August apparently killed the dogs and that panicked Libyans breached security by using international phone lines to call a German firm helping them build the plant. Allegations that West German companies were involved in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> sales and the Libyan plant have stunned and embarrassed the West German government and dominated news media here for three weeks. On Sunday, the Hamburg-based <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported that government officials, furious over the way the investigation has been handled, are demanding the resignation of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s intelligence chief Chief government spokesman <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> called the report `` pure speculation.''

 Burglars had struck <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastorek </PERSON>'s gas station twice in three days, making off with a total of more than $ 3,000. Then on Friday, a big <LOCATION> manila </LOCATION> envelope arrived in the mail and Pastorek figured it was more bad news, maybe from his lawyer or accountant. Inside, a note read: `` I am sorry. `` I drank too much and broke into your station on a dare. `` I am sorry.'' Along with the note, he found $ 167 in cash, and checks and credit card receipts worth about $ 1,600 _ everything that had been stolen from the station one week earlier. `` I about died,'' said <PERSON> Pastorek </PERSON>, 30. `` We figure his conscience was bothering him, and he probably was n't able to sleep for four or five nights.'' Now, he said, he's waiting for the burglar who hit Jan. 16 to get a case of the guilts. That one got away with about $ 1,400 in receipts. `` If the first guy did it on a dare, I'm wondering if maybe the second guy was the one who dared him. Maybe after he saw it could be done, he decided to try it himself,'' <PERSON> Pastorek </PERSON> said. Coincidentally, the city kicked off an honesty campaign last week, directed by the <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Ethics and Values. The head of the commission is <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Magruder </PERSON>, a Watergate conspirator who is now a Presbyterian minister.

 A Russian Orthodox Church leader is nominated in a country where believers long have been repressed. Leading reformers are not chosen to carry out major reforms. A faithful worker starts a protest hunger strike. This is the bewildering world of Soviet campaigning, one third of the way into the race for March 26 elections. It has raised questions about how much democracy there is in the new political system of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and it mirrors the complex processes going on in his country. `` I believe a more democratic mechanism of nominating candidates is needed,'' said Nobel Peace Prize winner <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, whose candidacy was rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and who now finds himself in the middle of one of the biggest disputes. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and thousands of others have been nominated at meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, trade unions, professional organizations and residents of geographical areas for seats in the 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will meet annually and will choose the Soviet president and members of a new, smaller and more active Supreme Soviet. Promoting the new system, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in December that political reforms are essential. `` It is only by combining economic reform with political changes, democratization and glasnost -LRB- openness -RRB-, that we can fulfill both the immediate and long-term tasks we have set ourselves,'' he said. Stronger local and national legislatures are essential, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. One third of the deputies are being chosen not on the traditional basis of geographic districts, but from the party, unions, professional organizations and other officially recognized groups. Issues espoused by those attending nominating meetings have affected the outcome. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported that <PERSON> Metropolitan </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON>, whose Russian Orthodox diocese includes <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, has been nominated by workers of an agricultural complex because of his concern over ecological issues. The law specifically allows clerical candidates. Though there are promises of reform, Soviet churches still are under Stalin-era laws that require they be registered and prevent them from organizing religious education or charity. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda reported Sunday that the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> refused to endorse reformist economist <PERSON> Tatyana </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaslavskaya </PERSON> because of her call for price increases to right the economy. It did endorse its chairman, <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalaev </PERSON>, who called for more vacation time. Others besides <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> question whether the system is democratic, and its complexity is causing a scramble for nominations in a country where voting has been little more than the ritual of electing a slate approved by authorities. Candidates may not espouse views contrary to the constitution, which enshrines the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as the leading and guiding force of Soviet society. Rank-and-file party members nominated 31,500 candidates for 100 seats. But on Jan. 10 the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> recommended 100 of them and the ruling Politburo put them on the ballot, ensuring that although a multitude of voices were heard early in the process, there will be no choices to make on election day. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> Lebedev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION> complained bitterly last week when the 67-year-old dean of the Soviet human rights movement and other leading proponents of reform were passed over for nomination by the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. At the academy, as well as other organizations and electoral districts, nominations must be winnowed by an official electoral commission. A group of several hundred people at <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s institute unanimously complained the academy's electoral commission was elitist, formed only from high-ranking members who selected others of similar rank. That left out <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and others like space scientist <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdeev </PERSON> and economists <PERSON> Gavril </PERSON> <PERSON> Popov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON>. The complexity of the electoral process allowed <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s supporters to nominate him from a geographical district instead, and they said more nominations were expected to increase his chances of being on the final ballot Elsewhere, the complexity allowed reformist writers <PERSON> Ales </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamovich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> to be nominated by the filmmaker's union rather than the writers' union, which is split by bitter differences between liberals and conservatives. In <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said 55-year-old factory worker <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON> declared a monthlong hunger strike Friday because the committee at his factory refused to hold a meeting to nominate him. <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON>, a winner of the government's State Prize, said party officials pressured the workers' council not to nominate him because of longstanding differences over pay and restructuring the economy, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> displayed on its front page Friday the text of a telegram saying two scientists and a journalist had gone on a hunger strike in <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION>, a city where <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> once served as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, because city officials refused to allow them to organize a local nominating meeting.

 Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, settling with apparent ease into their new life at 668 <LOCATION> Saint </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cloud </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, returned to an unusual standing ovation Sunday at the church where they worshiped before entering the White House. `` God ... has answered our prayers for you and for Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and I want you to know we are very pleased to welcome you back, and thank <PERSON> God </PERSON> for what you were able to do for your country in these last eight years,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Donn </PERSON> <PERSON> Moomaw </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The congregation, disregarding a precautionary note in the church bulletin against applauding during the service, stood and gave the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> a prolonged round of hand-clapping. `` We probably wo n't be doing that every Sunday you come,'' <PERSON> Moomaw </PERSON> said. The Reagans, seated near the back of the hilltop church, later took part in the Presbyterian communion service, in which wafers and grape juice are brought to the worshipers at their seats, and joined in the singing of `` Amazing Grace.'' <PERSON> Moomaw </PERSON> preached on a text from <ORGANIZATION> Ephesians </ORGANIZATION> 2 reading, in the translation he used, `` It is by grace that you have been saved through faith and not from yourselves; it is the gift of God, not by works, so that no one can boast.'' Well-wishers lined a rope line outside the church as the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> entered and left the church. People said, `` Nice to have you back'' and `` Welcome home'' and `` He looks so good.'' The Reagans were greeted on arrival by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McDougall </PERSON>, a deacon and 20-year member of the church who oversees parking, and by <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Vann </PERSON>, the head usher, with a white carnation in his lapel. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> moved here Friday from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after he completed an eight-year assignment in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Clusters of red, white and blue balloons and a `` ` Welcome <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> and Nancy'' sign remained up at one nearby house over the weekend, but otherwise the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' new street looked like your average neighborhood of multi-million dollar residences. `` Will he make a change?'' <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON>, a real estate executive who lives near the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, repeated the question to himself before answering. `` Maybe for a couple of weeks,'' he said. `` After that I think everything will be back to normal.'' Small knots of tourists gathered along the narrow winding street from time to time over the weekend, hoping to catch a glimpse of the former president and first lady. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' son, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON>, drove up in a red sports car and visited for about half an hour. While he was there, he and his parents appeared on a walkway that is visible from the road and waved. Occasionally, tour vans stopped in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' place _ a new stop on an established route that includes the homes of neighbors <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. Flowers were delivered for Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> man came outside the walls for a moment. But the elaborate security that was in effect when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visited here as president over the Christmas and New Year's holidays was gone. No longer was the street blocked off at both ends and security cars parked along its length. The Reagans continue to receive around-the-clock Secret Service protection. `` We wo n't give you the specifics of what they are going to get, how much,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It would really be kind of self-defeating for us to do that.'' <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON>, the new neighbor, estimated security had been scaled back by 80 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> will continue to be driven by the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. There was a 10-car caravan when they arrived Friday after the flight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` They come and go and are in and out of the driveway in 10 seconds and down the street,'' said <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON>. `` I do n't think it's going to be much of a problem. Like all the streets in the fashionable hillside neighborhood called <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Saint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cloud </ORGANIZATION> has no sidewalks _ apparently part of an effort to protect its exclusivity when it was first laid out as a haven for blue bloods in the 1920s. In a television interview broadcast on the CBS program `` 60 Minutes'' on Jan. l5, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, looking ahead to life after the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said not being on the front pages would be `` fine with me.'' `` I will not miss being under the microscope,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Indeed, attention is already shifting to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> as they get settled in at 1600 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> and away from the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> as they get settled in on Saint Cloud Road. `` We have our share of rubberneckers, but we have always had them,'' said <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON>. `` The novelty, I think, is going to very quickly wear off.'' As for the Reagans, they said during the flight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that they still have unpacking to do. `` Up to now, I've been doing that,'' the former first lady told reporters. Asked whether the president was good at unpacking, she just laughed.

<HEAD>Gandhi's Party Appears Headed For Setback In Key Southern State</HEAD>

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> party appeared headed for a setback Sunday in a state election seen as a barometer for national races later this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> party was not expected to win the legislative contest in the southern state of <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION>. But a respectable showing against the strong regional parties would have bolstered the Gandhi party's national image. `` The voting trend shows a major setback for <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. ... He will have to accept most of the blame,'' said the state's top political analyst, <PERSON> Cho </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON>. The frontrunner for the <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> state assembly seats was the <ORGANIZATION> Dravida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Munnetra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kazhagam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> Dravidian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, headed by screenwriter and politician <PERSON> Muthuvel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karunanidhi </PERSON>. With more than half the ballots from Saturday's election counted, <PERSON> Karunanidhi </PERSON>'s party or its allies led in 151 of the 232 constituencies, the government election control room reported. The state assembly has 234 seats, but elections in two districts were postponed due to the deaths of candidates. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was ahead in 35 districts. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> must call a national parliamentary election before the end of the year. The races will decide which party governs <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for the next five years. A surprise victory could have encouraged <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> to call early national elections before the various opposition groups join together in sufficient strength to unseat <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` The results will have an effect on national politics,'' said <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON>. State elections also were conducted Saturday in the northeastern states of <LOCATION> Nagaland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mizoram </LOCATION>, but results were expected to come in more slowly than those in <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION>. The other two groups in <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> to make a showing were rival factions of a party splintered between the wife and the leading lady of late movie star-politician M.G. <PERSON> Ramachandran </PERSON>. Former movie actress <PERSON> Jayalalitha </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayaram </PERSON>'s faction of the <ORGANIZATION> All-India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dravida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Munnestra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kazhagam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> led in 37 districts. Ms. <PERSON> Jayaram </PERSON>, 42, was a long-time close companion of <PERSON> Ramachandran </PERSON> and played opposite him in many movies. His widow, 64-year-old <PERSON> Janaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramachandran </PERSON>, also an ex-actress, heads a party faction that was leading in four districts. Independents led in eight districts. Cold weather delayed tallying in two other districts. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s most visible national political foe, V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, had backed <PERSON> Karunanidhi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> served as <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s finance and defense minister before he was expelled for conducting tax raids on government officials and inquiries into foreign arms deals. He is trying to unite the <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dal </ORGANIZATION>, a loose coalition of three north Indian parties, to muster enough strength to challenge <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> in national elections. `` V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> will project the <ORGANIZATION> DMK </ORGANIZATION>'s victory as his own,'' <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> said, referring to the <ORGANIZATION> Dravida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Munnestra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kazhagam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was not immediately available for comment. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said counting would not begin until Monday in <LOCATION> Mizoram </LOCATION> state, where some ballot boxes in remote villages had to be collected by helicopters. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> campaigned extensively for his party in the three states where elections were held Saturday. In all three, strong local parties traditionally triumph over the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the national attention centered on <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION>, where 36 million people were eligible to vote. The voter turnout was about 69 percent, election officials said. Turnouts were higher in the less populous northeastern states. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said 80 to 85 percent of the 300,000 eligible voters showed up in <LOCATION> Mizoram </LOCATION>, where a 40-member state assembly was being elected. Election officials estimated that 75 percent of <LOCATION> Nagaland </LOCATION>'s 600,000 eligible voters turned out to choose the 60-member state assembly

 In the 11 years since he last worked in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> has not minced words about his views on strategic policies, to the point of openly criticizing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on occasion. Now, in his opening days as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser, Scowcroft is shying away from discussing how his personal views might translate into <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration policy. `` The secretary of state should be the chief spokesman for the president's foreign policy. And the president makes foreign policy,'' Scowcroft, smiling, said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The national security adviser should be `` not exactly invisible,'' but certainly not in the spotlight. Reticence aside, Scowcroft's influence promises to be as great as his experience. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Scowcroft worked closely once before, when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director in 1976 and <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> was national security adviser to President Ford. Scowcroft, 63, said he has gained a sense of perspective since he began his first job at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, as military aide to <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff in 1972. He rose quickly, from the rank of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> colonel to three-star general, and to national security adviser 1975-77 after <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> replaced <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> became secretary of state. `` I've probably written and said more about the organization and the function of the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> system than ...,'' Scowcroft said, pausing, `` ... anyone in the country.'' He has a daunting assignment this time around, to direct a complete review of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategic interests, an assessment that many arms control experts predict will change the American negotiating position toward the Soviets and in the Pentagon budget that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> earlier this month. The task seems to rest lightly on Scowcroft's thin shoulders. He is balding and slight, five feet eight inches tall, and weighs 130 pounds, `` probably a little less than I did at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, because I had more muscle then.'' He keeps trim by jogging about three miles a night, after watching <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline'' late night interview show. Born in <LOCATION> Ogden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, he counts the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and his father as the significant early influences in his life. `` There is a notion among the Mormons that at the end of each day you ought to be able to say, ` I've made myself a better person or I have made things better by what I have done today,'' said <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>. But, he said, `` I am not a strict Mormon. I frequently have a glass of wine with dinner.'' And `` I enjoy coffee. I like to work at night,'' said <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, who has disciplined himself to work on four hours of sleep a night. `` Every once in a while, I crash. And when I operate this way, I fall asleep at the drop of a hat,'' he said. `` I learned to do that from <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, who does not require much sleep, especially on trips ... we used to take. About 1 o'clock in the morning he would issue to the staff a whole bunch of things he wanted done by the next morning, then he would go to bed and get up at 5:30 and expect to have them done,'' said <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> with a hearty laugh. Scowcroft lives in a modest brick home in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Marian </PERSON>, his wife of 37 years. Their daughter <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> works as an attorney in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Since leaving the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and retiring from the military, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> has worked in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office of <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>'s international consulting firm, and has served as a member of the commission that investigated the Iran-Contra affair and chairman of a presidential panel on strategic missile basing The basing panel, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, charted some policies that are sharply at odds with those of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Scowcroft has come out strongly in favor of a single-warhead mobile missile, known as the Midgetman. And he ridiculed the administration for proposing, at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, a system to base 10-warhead MX missiles on rail lines on small bases in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, a plan he said in an op-ed piece last year would make them sitting ducks. None of these ideas, he has written, make sense under a proposed Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty that would limit the number of both warheads and delivery vehicles, such as missles and bombers. Such a regime, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> has written, argues for single-warhead mobile missiles dispersed over a large area, such as the Midgetman. However <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his last budget proposal, killed funding for the Midgetman in favor of the 10-warhead MX missile, which would be deployed on rail cars on large bases in the Southwest. Scowcroft declines to say publicly what he recommended to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on such issues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, for his part, said during the campaign that he liked both the MX and the Midgetman, although budget constraints argue against deploying both. Scowcroft prefers to discuss his vision of a White House security adviser with the leisure `` to try to do some long-range planning, to sort of look out ahead, to hypothesize the kind of world that we would like to see, and then to look at the kind of forces that are at work for or against that kind of world.'' `` And I think that where we want to go has an importance that it really has n't had for much of the 40 years of the Cold War, and that is, a lot of the old truths, Cold War relations with the allies, economic relations, all those things are changing now,'' he said. `` We are no longer just trying to frantically hold the line in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, for example, to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> not an incitement to aggression by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. The world has changed vastly since Scowcroft was 12 and read a book called `` West Point Today.'' `` I fell in love with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, not with the military as such ... I did n't go because I wanted to spend 30 years in the military,'' said <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, who spent 29 years in uniform. After graduating from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> in 1947, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> joined the newly created <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and flew fighters until he crashed in a P-51 Mustang. `` I would rather call it a forced landing,'' he said with a laugh. `` A crash sounds totally uncontrolled.'' The forced landing crushed three vertebrae, and he spent two years in a hospital, recuperating and missing the Korean War. Denied the opportunity to fly in combat, Scowcroft switched tracks, earning masters and doctoral degrees from <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, teaching Russian history at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, learning Serbo-Croatian, and serving as deputy air attache at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> 1959-61. Reflecting on his years in uniform and at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> says he would like to be remembered by the epitaph: `` He served with distinction.''

<HEAD>Successful Breeding Program Sends Red Wolves Back to The Wild</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The effort to reintroduce to the wild an animal that survived only in captivity is expanding with the introduction of a pair of red wolves to an island in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` It's exciting to know that some are running free at last,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinette </PERSON>, the curator of mammals at the Audubon Zoo here. The red wolf, smaller and more elusive than its gray cousin, once roamed the bottomlands of the South from the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. About 100 survive in captivity; the last few wild, purebred red wolves were captured by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in the late 1970s for captive breeding at the Point Defiance Zoo in <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. A few days ago, a pair was released at <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a wilderness area off the coast of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> The male was from Audubon and the female of the pair was raised at Point Defiance. Since September 1987, four pairs of wolves raised at <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> have been released in the Alligator River Refuge in coastal <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. At least two cubs were spotted last summer. A second group of red wolves was reintroduced to the wild on <LOCATION> Bulls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, officials said. In addition to wolves raised at <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, the Audubon Zoo has added nine pups to the population and a female and four cubs were sent to the <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> program over the weekend. Wildlife officials hope the pair on <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> _ now becoming acclimated in a sprawling penned area _ will breed in February or early March and produce a litter in April. `` The hope is to release them and let them raise the pups as free from human contact as possible,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, the Audubon Zoo's assistant curator of the red wolf exhibit said `` Our wolves have retained some hunting instincts, they'll go after squirrels or birds that go in their pen, but for the wolves to live in the wild they have to be total hunters.'' <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> was selected as the breeding site because it provides plenty of prey. `` It's wonderful to have them in exhibits but to maintain the species the way it should be there has to be natural selection. They have to live in the wild,'' <PERSON> Robinette </PERSON> said.

 A 74-year-old priest who built a shrine to Poles killed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was found dead in his apartment, and friends and authorities said the evidence points to foul play. The Rev. <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Niedzielak </PERSON>, provost of the <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Borromeo </PERSON> parish, was found dead at his home across the street from the church, the friends said. The priest's apartment appeared to have been ransacked and he was found lying on the floor with his face bloodied, said <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziembinski </PERSON>, a Polish independence activist who knew the priest. An autopsy was scheduled for Monday, said <PERSON> Zofia </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaszewska </PERSON>, an official of the Solidarity union movement, with which the priest sympathized. She said some things seemed to have been stolen from the apartment. `` Maybe it is simply a plain robbery on a parish, maybe not,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Romaszewska </PERSON>. State radio on Sunday evening reported that the investigation had shown signs of burglary and pointed toward murder. `` Intensive investigation is underway, and investigatons are being conducted to clear up the circumstances of this tragedy,'' radio said. The church where the priest served is a historical sanctuary within the Powazki cemetery. `` A wall is filled with plaques commemorating Poles killed in the East ... It is the whole of Poish history, reaching as far back as the 19th century,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Romaszewska </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Niedzielak </PERSON> was to have said a Mass on Sunday in honor of Poles who died in the 1863 January nationalist uprising against the Russians. In 1987, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> had 527 murders, according to official figures.

<HEAD>Bundy Described As Manipulative, Deceptive Criminal Genius</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> `` Ted'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, scheduled to die Tuesday in the electric chair, has been depicted as a diabolical genius, a handsome and charming figure who, `` like the plague,'' brought death wherever he went. The 42-year-old former law student awaits execution for the 1978 murder of <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, a 12-year-old from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> also faces execution for clubbing to death two young women at a sorority house in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> three weeks before Miss <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> disappeared from a schoolyard. He has been called a suspect in the deaths of as many as 36 women. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, was asked recently why the public was fascinated with his client. `` He's intelligent, attractive. He's your next-door neighbor. He's one of us,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. But at a clemency hearing in 1985 for Bundy in the sorority slayings, Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Poitinger </PERSON> said, `` Bundy is like the plague. Everywhere he goes, death follows.'' State Attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, who prosecuted <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> for the <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> killing, said he sees two reasons for the public fascination and revulsion with <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>. `` The mere fact that he is a mass murderer, a serial murderer, gives rise to a certain degree of notoriety,'' <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said. `` The other reason is the persona of <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> does not fit our stereotypical concept of what a criminal ought to be and what a mass murderer, in particular, ought to be.'' `` Bundy is very handsome, he is bright, he's articulate, he's trained in the legal system He is all those things that we assume a mass murderer is not. His very persona contributes to the public's fascination with the case. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> in 1987 called him `` a diabolical genius'' and said he was `` probably the most competent serial killer in the country at this time.'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> has been the subject of five books and a TV miniseries, `` The Deliberate Stranger,'' which starred <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> has been linked to eight slayings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state in 1974 that became known as the `` Ted'' murders because witnesses reported seeing a charming young stranger who called himself <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> near where the victims disappeared. In interviews with authorities over the weekend, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> is said to have confessed to those slayings as well as others. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> became one of the nation's most-wanted fugitives after he twice escaped custody in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, where he was being held on charges of murdering a nurse. At the time, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was sought for questioning in 36 slayings of young women. He was captured in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> in 1978. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was believed to have stalked young women near college campuses, shopping centers and parks, targeting victims with long, dark hair parted in the middle. Prosecutors said he lured victims into his car by posing as a police officer or by making false requests for aid, sometimes using crutches as a prop. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> also became known as an escape artist who could easily change his appearance and blend into a community. He was caught in 1984 in an escape attempt from death row at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION>, the state's most heavily guarded penitentiary. He was found with two hacksaw blades under his mattress and had already cut through one of the cell bars. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was born <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowell </PERSON> on Nov. 24, 1946, in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, to a department store clerk, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowell </PERSON>, at a home for unwed mothers. His father was described by his mother as a big-talking sailor home from the war. When <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was 4, he and his mother moved to <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, where she met <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Culpepper </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> at a Methodist church social. They were married and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> went to work as a cook at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was a good student but not brillant. He was described as boisterous and prone to fights on the playground, and shy and awkward in the classroom. He was a Boy Scout and vice president of his church youth group. He became active in the state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and received a glowing letter of recommendation to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> law school from <LOCATION> then-Washington </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. Police said that as a young man <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> began shoplifting things the family was too poor to buy and was once caught trying to steal a car. Authorities also said he was obsessed with pornography. After his arrest in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> told a detective, `` Pornography is one person's pleasure, another person's vice or downfall.''

<HEAD>Former Klansman Says Election Signals Change In Voter Sentiment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klansman </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said his top finish in a primary election for state representative signals renewed voter interest in white supremacy. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, former imperial wizard of the Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>, led a field of seven candidates in Saturday's primary election for a vacant state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat representing a suburban district that is 99 percent white. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> received 33 percent of the vote and will face second-place finisher <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> in a Feb. 18 runoff. <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> had 19 percent of the vote. `` I think the people knew that by my past involvement -LRB- with the Klan -RRB-, people know that I say what I really believe,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said after Saturday's vote. `` The Klan is far behind me, but the effort for equal rights for everybody is ahead of me. `` I think when I win this race you'll find candidates across the state and across the country begin to talk about the issues I'm raising I think this is the beginning of a change in this country.'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> left the Klan in 1980 after being accused of trying to sell top-secret membership lists and set up the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of White People. He calls himself a white civil rights worker. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s open primary system places all candidates on the same ballot, regardless of party affiliation. If none receives a majority, there is a runoff election between the top two vote-getters. Saturday's vote in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> represented a 54 percent turnout of registered voters. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, 38, ran as a Republican with a campaign platform including proposed welfare revisions aimed at reducing black births. He said Saturday that he fully expected the platform to carry him into the Legislature in February. `` I think most people know I am trying to help them,'' he said. `` I think those -LRB- racial -RRB- issues are hurting our community's economy, increasing crime ...'' <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>, 68, also a Republican and brother of former <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>, said the outcome was due to a solid voting bloc for <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> and a large field of candidates. He disagreed with <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s claim that the result showed racial overtones. `` I do n't think that's true at all. I do n't think the people are trying to send a message to anybody,'' <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> said. `` There were a number of fine candidates in this race. The vote was split in so many directions that his lead is not indicative of the direction or the attitudes of the voters of Jefferson Parish.'' <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>, who has been endorsed by several local politicians, said other candidates in the race have committed their support to him in the runoff. <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> is a construction contractor. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> describes himself as a professional writer who contributes articles on history and other subjects to periodicals under a pseudonym, which he said avoids problems with publication.

<HEAD>Cabinet Questions Tougher Measures As Palestinians Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONI RABIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Cabinet on Sunday debated a policy that gives troops greater freedom to shoot at <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> protesters, and both Palestinians and <LOCATION> Israelis </LOCATION> rejected a new peace plan for the occupied lands. In the occupied territories, most shopkeepers closed stores to observe a strike called by the Moslem fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> movement, and the army imposed curfews that confined about 180,000 Arabs to their homes in several <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camps. Arab news reports said six <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> protesters were shot and wounded in clashes with soldiers in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The army could not confirm the casualties but reported two other woundings. At the weekly Cabinet meeting, Energy Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahal </PERSON> of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to liberalize orders for opening fire on Palestinian protesters The new rules allow officers and soldiers with special training to shoot plastic bullets at Arabs who throw stones and set up roadblocks. Previously, only officers were allowed to fire the plastic bullets, and only in life-threatening situations. `` I think the issue is worth checking,'' <PERSON> Shahal </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> before the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> meeting, adding that the new orders were `` possibly illegal.'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, also of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, and other ministers lashed out at <PERSON> Shahal </PERSON>'s criticism, the radio said. `` We have an emergency situation ... and have to do everything possible to quell the riots,'' Cabinet Minister <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON> of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION> said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> lawyers planned to discuss the issue with military attorneys later this week. Speaking on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television after the Cabinet meeting, Labor leader and Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> defended the use of plastic bullets, which have been blamed for at least 40 deaths. `` Why do we use plastic bullets? Not because it gives us great pleasure, but because regular bullets cause more deaths,'' he said. At least 367 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have died in the uprising that began Dec. 8, 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to review and examine the use of plastic bullets, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said. According to the independent Hadashot newspaper, the army is about to introduce a new type of rubber bullet more effective in dispersing crowds but incapable of penetrating the skin. A military spokesman refused comment. Meanwhile, both Palestinians and Israelis rejected an unofficial peace proposal put forth Thursday by <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, who offered free elections in the territories in exchange for a cease-fire in the uprising, peace talks and eventually a confederation between the occupied lands and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bethelehem </LOCATION>'s Palestinian mayor, <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> the plan `` will lead nowhere.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s plan Friday. The leftist Peace Now movement said the proposal could be viewed as serious only if accompanied by cancellation of harsh army policies and the release of detained <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders. Within <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s own left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, Communications Minister <PERSON> Gad </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaacobi </PERSON> said that he accepts the plan just `` as an interim stage, not as a final settlement.'' French Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>, on a two-day visit, called for direct negotiations with Palestinians to ensure `` peace, stability and security in the region.'' `` Peace can only come about only via direct negotiations between the parties directly involved, and that means mutual, reciprocal recognition,'' <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> said after meetings with President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, assailants presumed to be Palestinians hurled two firebombs at a bus full of Arab workers breaking a general strike by reporting to jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The workers fled the burning bus and no one was injured, an Arab reporter said. Also Sunday, a military court in <LOCATION> Lod </LOCATION>, sentenced three Palestinians to prison terms of at least 20 years for attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. One, a member of the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> faction, guided the suicide driver of last October's car bomb that killed eight <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

Accompanied by <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan-Asher </PERSON>, one of the French Jews whom his father, <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>, saved, the foreign minister laid a wreath the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial's eternal flame kept alight in memory of the 6 million Jews who were killed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> then walked through the memorial gardens to a special park dedicated to those non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews. He planted the foot-high sapling, shoveled earth around it and watered the small tree. `` When you are responsible for public affairs, as I am, the memories you carry in your soul are always present,'' <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> said. `` I thank you for suggesting this opportunity, in the name of my father, and ... all those who displayed the necessary behavior, inspired by a respect for individual rights and a love of liberty,'' he said. <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> said his father <PERSON> Georges </PERSON>, as a member of the resistance, helped warn Jews in the French town of <LOCATION> Limoges </LOCATION> of imminent raids, hid them, and provided them with false documents so they could escape. Among the people whom his father saved was a schoolgirl, <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan-Asher </PERSON>, who survived by staying hidden in a monastary, he said. Ms. <PERSON> Nathan-Asher </PERSON> broke down in tears as she came forward to express thanks to <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>, a pilot during World War I, was executed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> on March 26, 1944, after being identified as a resistance leader.

<HEAD>Femininity Stars at Opening of French Haute Couture Shows</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> drifted into spring and summer on a soft pastel cloud, sometimes bursting open with color, at Sunday's opening of French haute couture collections Femininity, and the unexepected, already prevail in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s favorite fashion son, <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON>, will ensure the surprise ending this year. Abandoning <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, at least this season, he will cap the week of French collections on Thursday with his first haute couture showing in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The move, which has unsettled Roman fashion lords, serves to confirm the pre-eminence of French haute couture, which can set trends for the entire fashion industry. Romance, sometimes smoldering, is clearly the word for summer from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, and chiffon or crepe is the language of love, even in pants. Sexy sheaths make sure the romance is enticing. Hem lengths traveled from the floor to above the knee with no minis yet in sight. Exaggerated shoulders also disappeared. Gold was the prevailing accent, from buttons to loafers at <LOCATION> Lacroix </LOCATION>, along with ruffles and wide-brimmed hats. <PERSON> Torrente </PERSON>, opening the season, used chiffon dramatically, in capes, trains or simply as long scarves carressing the neck. Sailor themes cropped up as a counterpoint to softness, with clean marine lines in navy or black and white. Leaving Provencal behind for exotic Saharan climes, <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> draped reams of chiffon in flowing pants-skirts reminiscent of a gust of sand, embroidered and bejeweled raw silk, used lace almost relentlessly and gathered organza into sumptuous mountains. His palette was above all the beige-tones and exotic pastels like melon and pistachio, mixed with bright poppy, Persian blue and black, white and navy. <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> made good his gift for surprise, mixing rustic and fine fabrics in his 57 outfits, introducing the fringe and occasionally poking a hole in his pastel clouds with rhythmic lines and splashes of loud color. Minimizing the waist, the `` trapezium'' and `` pyramid'' shapes prevailed for day wear at <LOCATION> Lacroix </LOCATION>. It was pure charm in a powder pink shantung tunic which flared over cocoa-colored, silk linen `` pencil'' pants. A pyramid coat-dress in verbena linen, flared above the waist, or a Persian blue silk trapezium raincoat also had that demure charm. Body-skimming softness or smoldering black lace, organza and raffia took over for after-hours when feminine turns female. <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> revealed his knack for the spectacular with a few fringes. For daywear, he dressed up a khaki linen outfit with black embroidery on top and black fringes dancing on the skirt. A dramatic after-dark version featured gold and thread woven pajamas with a beaded floor-length fringe. Pants-skirts or strapless jumpsuits, as elegant as gowns, were often topped with intricate embroidery or lace and warn under sumptuous jackets. Typifying the mood of wistful romance was his number aptly entitled `` Je t ` aime'' -LRB- I love you -RRB-, a drifty vanilla-colored poncho of organza decorated with hand-painted flowers and collared with lace, warn over a sandy-colored chiffon His `` piece de resistance'' was the strapless pique floor-length dress, tenderly flowered and topped with a shawl-like blue ziberline jacket with fringe. <PERSON> Torrente </PERSON> maintained Parisian chic by day with polka dot pastel dresses, kick pleats sometimes topped with a bow, or tiered dresses and, always, wide-brimmed hats. Elegance by night was, most notably, in black and white. Draped chiffon and crepe, held at the shoulder or waist with jewels or a bow, were lovely. Smoky chiffon scarves were beautifully used in dramatic trains, sometimes running from the shoulder. There was drama in an almost classic solid black gown, with lapels at the bodice and a whimsical white and black polka dot kerchief. <PERSON> Hanae </PERSON> <PERSON> Mori </PERSON> ended the day's shows with more accolades to femininity. Her floor-length yellow draped sheath with a line of ruffles running from the shoulders to the toes is a toast to the female form. The corsage ruffle at the bust is another note to the refined sophistication that marked her show.

<TEXT>
 More than 160,000 Japanese filed past a portrait of the late Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> on Sunday as the Imperial Palace gates were opened to the public for the first time since the monarch died two weeks ago. Palace officials said 164,300 people had visited by evening Sunday, the first of three days the palace will be open to the public. They attributed the large turnout in part to sunny skies. A cold morning wind did not stop more than 5,400 people from gathering at <LOCATION> Nijubashi </LOCATION>, the palace's main entrance, by 9 a.m., when a team of police officers pulled the tall, wooden gate open. Uniformed police formed a row at the front of the orderly crowd as it marched slowly toward the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> square, where a gold-framed photograph of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> could be seen behind the bullet-proof glass of a palace balcony. Displays of chrysanthemums, symbols of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s monarchy, stood on either side of the black-and-white photograph, taken when the emperor was 80 years old. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> died of cancer Jan. 7 at age 87. Security around the palace was tight, with traffic sealed off and at least 600 officers patrolling the grounds. Police watched from nearby rooftops as visitors stood in a carefully roped-off line that wound through gravel plazas outside the moated palace. Police say at least six ultra-leftist groups, including the radical Chukaku-ha, or Middle Core Faction, have threatened to disrupt observances for the emperor. No incidents were reported Sunday, however. Though conservatively clad men and women over 40 made up most of the morning crowd, extreme rightists dressed in black suits and black ties were a highly visible presence at the palace. One rightist group formed two rows in military style before bowing to the portrait, as officials tried to shoo news photographers away. <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Akao </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s best-known extreme rightists, was accompanied by about 20 followers in blue uniforms as he folded his hands as if in prayer before the nearly 6-foot-tall portrait. `` We are going to either see a communist revolution or a revival of patriotism,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` These are very dangerous times.'' <PERSON> Akao </PERSON> is head of the staunchly anti-communist <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has a membership estimated at up to 5,000. `` I experienced the war and coming here today I felt sorry for the emperor,'' said housewife <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozeki </PERSON>, 57. `` He must have had a very hard life, but he was a wonderful man.'' Government leaders and representatives of various private groups already have paid their respects to <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, whose state funeral is scheduled Feb. 24. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the Israeli Cabinet gave approval for President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> on Sunday to attend <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral. The Cabinet did not hold a formal vote on <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>'s trip but at its meeting Sunday, two ministers voiced their opposition, <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Elyakim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> said. The ministers, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> of the hardline <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Peretz </PERSON> of the ultra-Orthodox <ORGANIZATION> Shas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, contended <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> should not pay respects to <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> because of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s alliance with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> during World War II, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said.

<HEAD>Inmate Claims Investigators Threatened Him In Prison Guard Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities are looking into allegations of misconduct by investigators in a probe of corruption among prison guards after an inmate said he was threatened, a newspaper reported Sunday. Internal reviews by the district attorney's office and police department were prompted in part by a work-release prisoner's complaint that two investigators threatened to hang him, shoot him or have him raped by other prisoners for refusing to implicate a guard in an alleged February 1988 beating, The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported The corruption probe, Operation Ferret, has resulted in criminal charges against 58 prison employees. The newspaper quoted an unidentified police official as saying the department is investigating a police detective in connection with his work on Operation Ferret, but declined to give details. Operation Ferret is a two-year inquiry that District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> said last year would eventually result in at least 100 arrests. Through spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> declined to comment. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said office policy prohibits public comment on any pending investigation or confirmation of its existence. The prisoner who complained of the threats, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON>, 27, told the <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> a member of <PERSON> Castille </PERSON>'s staff questioned him last week about his allegations. Last May, according to prison records, <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> told a social worker and a corrections sergeant, who wrote memos about his complaints to their supervisors, that two investigators had handcuffed him to a chair and accused him of lying to them about the alleged February 1988 beating of prisoner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. That beating led to the first wave of arrests last March. Seven guards were accused of beating <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> at a work-release residence or lying to conceal the incident. Charges against those guards have been dropped or thrown out. <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON>, serving a 3 -LCB- - to-seven-year sentence for theft by deception told authorities last February that he saw no misconduct by guards on the night of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s alleged beating Social worker <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> and Corrections Sgt. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> wrote in memos obtained by the Inquirer that <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> said he was taken to the city prisons' internal affairs building and threatened repeatedly by two investigators whom he could not identify. According to the memo, <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> said the two men warned him: `` If you do n't say what we want, we are going to hang you from the neck here in the back room.'' Former Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Odell </PERSON> <PERSON> Guyton </PERSON>, who initiated Operation Ferret and supervised it until December, said he had received Ms. <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>'s memo, but would not say what he had done in response.

<TEXT>
 Police arrested up to 500 people who tried to attend a vigil at the grave of a student who burned himself to death to protest the 1968 Soviet-led invasion, activists said Sunday. The protesters were arrested in the village of <LOCATION> Vsetaty </LOCATION>, 18 miles from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and the hometown of <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>, who killed himself in Wencensclas Square in January 1969. Activist <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON> said between 400 and 500 people who tried to hold a vigil at the heavily guarded cemetery where <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> is buried were arrested on Saturday. Police had blocked roads and interrogated visitors on Saturday. The arrests bring to 800 the number of people held during a week of anti-government protests, the biggest wave of unrest in the <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 20 years. A heavy police presence in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Vsetaty </PERSON>, threats of prosecution and the hundreds of arrests appeared to have stilled the protests by Sunday. <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON>, a member of the Charter 77 activist group, said police detained people Saturday who could not prove they were Vsetaty residents. He said most were taken to a nearby state farm, questioned, photographed and released. <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON> said two activists, <PERSON> Ludvik </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON> of the independent youth group Czech Children and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Litomirsky </PERSON> of the Democratic Initiative, apparently had been detained overnight. <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON> also reported that <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s lawyer had seen the jailed activist on Friday. He said the activists could face charges with penalities of up to three years in jail. The protests signal a growing frustration with the lack of social and economic reforms similiar to those implemented by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, whose `` Prague Spring'' reforms of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> were crushed by Soviet troops in 1968. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was ousted as former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> by the Soviets in August 1968 after a fleeting attempt to introduce many of the reforms now embraced by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was interviewed by telephone by the Italian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> l'Unita </ORGANIZATION>, which carried a front-page story on Sunday. He was asked to comment on the current wave of protests in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` There is a basic crisis that involves, above all, the young people, the 20-year-old children of the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring ... who have no future,'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` What young people are asking for is a rebirth of the type underway in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, that involves even the party for the first thing,'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> said in the interview. The latest protests began on Jan. 15, when about 5,000 activists tried to hold a vigil for <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> in Wenceslas Square. Police broke up the crowd with tear gas and truncheons and arrested 117 people. <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> had set himself on fire in the square to protest the Soviet invasion that led to <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s ouster. On Jan. 16, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s best-known dissident, banned playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, and 12 other prominent activists were detained after trying to lay flowers in memory of <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>. They are still in jail, and fellow activists say it appears they will face charges that could jail them for up to two or three years. <PERSON> Mlada </PERSON> <PERSON> Fronta </PERSON> said Saturday that 280 people were detained Thursday during the week's worst violence, when riot police charged a crowd of more than 2,000 and beat several people in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Party Leader Denounces Calls For His Ouster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communist party chief <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> denounced calls for his ouster and warned that the economically and ethnically troubled country could fall victim to political extremism, a published report said Sunday. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> also predicted frank discussions at a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting this week of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communists </ORGANIZATION>, but implied he expected to withstand an effort to run him out of office. The party chief has been the focus of unprecedented attacks by <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> leaders that reflect the hard-line stance of the <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> communist party led by <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, who is believed to have presidential aspirations. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, president of the executive Presidium, accused `` sections'' of the party, media and various political meetings of being `` maximally concentrated on dismembering the current ... <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and its Presidium and ... on eventually replacing, blocking and fully compromising its current president. `` The tension in the country has increased and so has the concern of the great majority -LRB- of Yugoslavs -RRB- for the fate of socialism in our country,'' he said in an interview on <LOCATION> Zagreb </LOCATION> television Saturday night that was carried by newspapers Sunday. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> warned that rifts in the country's leadership comprised a `` clash of concepts'' that could lead the country to extremes, either restoration of a `` bourgeois'' system or `` neo-Stalinism. There has been increasing unrest in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> where inflation is hovering at 250 percent, living standards are sinking and the country is burdened by a $ 21 billion foreign debt. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> said he was `` deeply convinced'' that the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communists </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting scheduled for Wednesday would be marked by `` a completely open discussion ... and we must no longer play hide and seek.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting is widely expected to reflect deepening rifts in the Yugoslav leadership and result in a clash between liberal factions in the party and a hard-line coalition led by <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>. `` We must call matters ... relations ... and persons by their true name,'' <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> said in the interview, adding that he was ready `` to fully account for everything before the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> which elected me to the Presidium, and before the presidium which elected me -LRB- its -RRB- president.'' <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> has been accused at numerous party meetings in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> and in the republic of <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION> of allegedly opposing mass street demonstrations that forced the ouster of the entire Montenegrin ruling elite. A communist party conference in the province of <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> also called for his ouster last week. The protests were seen in the northern republics of <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> as having been orchestrated by <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> supporters to bring <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION> under tighter political control by <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, a Croat, indicated he did not expect the communist leadership to replace him, saying he hoped to remain party chief for the remaining six months of his tenure. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> suggested that people taking part in mass rallies that forced the resignations of numerous Serbian and Montenegrin leaders allegedly opposed to <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> were being `` led astray ... by demagogues. `` We can depose leaderships,'' he said, but warned, `` such an atmosphere ... would lead us to disaster.'' In another development, the <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported a communist party meeting in the Croatian town of <LOCATION> Zlatar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bistrica </LOCATION> on Saturday demanded that <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, as a member of the <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> communist Party Presidium, be called to account for `` moral-political responsibility'' over his not reacting to `` unargumented attacks'' on Suvar at the <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> party conference. Much of last year's unrest has centered on the province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, where ethnic Albanians form a majority of more than 90 percent. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> is the largest republic, and both provinces, <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>, are part of it but not fully subject to its control.

 An opposition coalition on Sunday formally selected attorney <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> as its candidate in the May 7 presidential election. In a related development, the Panamanian military accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of harassing Panamanians. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, 52, pledged to form a `` government of national reconstruction'' and replace Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and country's de facto ruler.

The Civic Crusade and several other small opposition parties took part in the convention along with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. Another opposition party,, the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, plans a nominating convention next week and the seven-party government coalition will announce its candidate on Feb. 1. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday accused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops of having `` intensified their campaign of persecution'' against Panamanians entering areas under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> control. `` This campaign of persecution includes threats with firearms, insults, illegal and unnecessary interrogations, arbitrary arrest, the excessive use of force, cruel and degrading treatment,'' the Defense Forces said in a press release. The statement said the interrogations are conducted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military intelligence agents trying to obtain information about <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. The Defense Forces said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops have no right to detain Panamanian citizens and it urged people who are detained to `` remain calm,'' refuse to sign any documents and demand to see a Panamanian military policeman. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ormsbee </PERSON> said he would have no comment Sunday on the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> statement. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> said the `` campaign of persecution'' is worst along the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> near Southern Command headquarters. The command has about 13,000 troops guarding the canal, which will be turned over to Panamanian control in the year 2000. Tensions between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Panamanian troops have been high since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began trying last year to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to relinquish power. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal grand jury has indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug trafficking charges.

 Nearly 90 youths returned to the capital Sunday after an week-long journey from a rebel camp, where they had fled to excape a military crackdown last year, a student said. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Pe </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, 23, a law student from <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said about 250 youths remained at the U Thuta camp near the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border. Most wanted to return, he said, but three student leaders dissuaded them, saying the military would kill those who returned. He said about 60 percent of students in the border areas have become ill and six died at U Thuta camp. About 100 set out on foot Jan. 14 from U Thuta, but illness forced 13 to drop out in villages along the seven-day walk to <LOCATION> Kamamaung </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Karen </LOCATION> state, Pe Win said. From there, the military transported the 87 remaining youths, mostly students, to <LOCATION> Thaton </LOCATION> camp, about 100 miles east of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, and then to <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> to return to their homes. The U Thuta camp is controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Karen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, one of about a dozen ethnic groups fighting the central government for greater autonomy.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is pulling out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> with a sense of having failed its mission, a Soviet commander said Sunday. `` We have not succeeded in everything we planned to do here,'' Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON>, a political officer at the military high command in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, told Western correspondents. `` We came here with an honorable task, with open hearts ... We are leaving and we have a sense of not having accomplished our mission to the end.'' <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON>, dressed in camouflage uniform, chain-smoking and joking occasionally with reporters, said <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> officers are communicating with guerrilla commanders on parts of the key <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway, the main route to the Soviet border, to try to keep it open so that supplies may get through. Under a U.N.-mediated accord signed in April, the Soviets' 100,000 troops began leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15, and half were out by Aug. 15 The remainder are to leave by Feb. 15. The Soviets announced late last year they had indefinitely suspended the withdrawal of the remaining troops because of continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Pakistani aid to the guerrillas. <PERSON> Serebov </PERSON> disputed reports from Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> that the withdrawal already resumed in earnest in early January. However, Afghan troops now are manning former Soviet posts on the perimeter of this beleaguered capital, not far from guerrilla positions. And hundreds of fully equipped Soviet troops can be seen boarding giant Ilyushin 76 transport aircraft ferrying in and out of the airport daily. Asked how the Soviets planned to evacuate troops by air and up the hazardous, 250-mile <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway by Feb. 15 in bitter winter weather, <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON> noted: `` That's our problem.'' Pressed about visual evidence of troops leaving, <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON>, speaking through an interpreter, argued that the departing troops had merely completed their two-year military service and `` are being replaced with new ones.'' `` We are ready ... to end the withdrawal by Feb. 15, but we have not yet received the order to start the final stage of withdrawal,'' he said. He dodged questions about reports, including from one Soviet source in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, that the military high command will move from the Afghan capital to the town of <LOCATION> Hairatan </LOCATION> on the Soviet border between Jan. 31 and Feb. 2. Asked how the commanders will go if they remain in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> until the deadline, he said, `` We will find a way.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to back up government troops in their war with the Moslem guerrillas. As the Soviets have left, the guerrillas have closed in on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, raising fears of a bloodbath once <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s conscript army is left alone. `` There could be some instability ... but I do n't think it will be critical,'' <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON> said. Soviet officers have privately expressed serious reservations about the ability of the Afghan army to fight alone. <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON> said the Soviets, who last week began an airlift of emergency food and fuel to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, `` have to feed the whole city now.'' Shortages are worsening in the capital, with bread queues forming in sub-freezing temperatures and roads clogged with lines of cars and buses at gasoline stations. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda accused the resistance of buying up food supplies in the capital and spiriting them out of the city. It quoted Defense Minister <PERSON> Shakh </PERSON> <PERSON> Navaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanay </PERSON> as saying that during a sweep of the city in search of weapons, soldiers found `` big supplies of food and goods of priority need.'' Supply roads into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> have been blocked periodically in January by resistance attacks and by heavy snows. Pravda said supply trucks started getting through the snow and rebel attacks again on Jan. 19. <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON> acknowledged that the Soviet air force is continuing bombing raids on guerrilla positions. But he accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of repeated violations of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> accord by continuing to arm the seven-group guerrilla alliance through neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` That is why the situation around <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is so tense,'' he said. `` This is not because of the presence of Soviet troops in the country.'' He paused and then compared the planned withdrawal favorably with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pullout from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. He told an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> reporter: `` Your generals ran away from <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>. But we have a withdrawal that is proceeding according to a timetable.'' <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON>'s surprise meeting with the small group of Western reporters came after a news blackout of several weeks by the Soviet command.

 At least 24 people, including four Indian soldiers, were killed across <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> in separatist violence during the weekend, mililtary officials said Sunday. The officials who can not be identified under standing briefing regulations, said 16 Sinhalese were killed in seven separate attacks since Saturday. The attacks were blamed on the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of radical Sinhalese oppopsed to <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>'s peace overtures to the Tamils fighting for a separate homeland in the Indian ocean republic since 1983.

The front says that <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> was offering too many concessions to the Tamils. In the Tamil-dominated north, four Indian soldiers were killed Saturday when ambushed by the most powerful of the Tamil separatrist group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiger </ORGANIZATION>'s of Tamil Eelam. The attack occured at <LOCATION> Vavunia </LOCATION>, 135 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has an estimated 44,000 troops in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to enforce the July 1987 peace accord aimed at ending the Tamil secessionist campaign.

 A nude man shouting `` Hail Satan'' as he strolled through a popular beachfront restaurant was arrested and later linked to a fatal hit-run crash, authorities said Sunday. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlow </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> allegedly was driving a stolen pickup truck involved in the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> crash minutes before the Friday night restaurant escapade that led to his arrest, said Officer <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Keifer </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol. <PERSON> Harlow </PERSON>, hospitalized briefly for observation at <ORGANIZATION> Harbor-UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, was booked for investigation of murder and was being held without bail Sunday at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Keifer </PERSON> said. Startled diners at the <ORGANIZATION> Chart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> restaurant avoided conversing with the nude man as he `` strolled casually through the restaurant showing himself to all the tables,'' said manager <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>. He then sat at an unoccupied table. `` A waiter told him he'd better leave and he said he was Satan and he was going to die. We left him alone, hoping the sheriffs would show up,'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. Dozens of customers looked and giggled, he said. Five minutes after entering the restaurant yelling `` Hail Satan,'' he walked through the crowded bar to an outside patio and down to a rocky outcropping on the beach, where he was detained by authorities.

<TEXT>
 A drifter who said his fascination with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> led him to pose as one is on trial for the killings of three Indian women. Testimony was to start Monday in the trial of <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glaze </PERSON>, 44, who is charged with six counts of first-degree murder in the mutilation deaths of the women. The trial is expected to last six to eight weeks. Many in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>' American Indian community say they are relieved to see the case go to trial. `` People are happy that someone has been caught and questioned and is going on trial for the murders,'' said <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in a neighborhood near downtown, where the bodies were found. `` Hopefully he's the right one,'' said the head of security for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>'s AIM Patrol, who identified himself only as Bear. The group polices Indian neighborhoods. Glaze had pleaded innocent to the charges. He is being held on $ 2 million bail. The victims _ <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Angeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitebird-Sweet </PERSON> and <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> _ all were patrons of <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> bars, where police say they believe the women met their killer. Their bodies were mutilated and posed in suggestive positions after their deaths, prompting <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> police homicide head <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> to term the slayer `` a vicious killer'' who was `` making some kind of a statement.'' Glaze once told a television reporter that he had claimed to be an Indian because <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> fascinated him, and federal authorities said he used aliases including <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Settingcrow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitting </PERSON> <PERSON> Crow </PERSON>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON>, Glaze's lawyer, would not discuss the case.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> and opposition leader <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> plan to meet Monday to discuss escalating political violence between the governing <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The two rivals are to meet at the <ORGANIZATION> Wyndham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kingston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> at 5 p.m., shortly after their respective parties nominate the official candidates for the Feb. 9 elections. The prime minister scheduled the meeting after <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> wrote him a letter requesting they meet in light of the surge of political violence within the past week. <PERSON> Basil </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, 58, was killed and <PERSON> Merlina </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 49, and <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, 39, were shot and wounded Friday during a clash between rival political bands in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, the police said. There also have been clashes reported between supporters of <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In his letter, <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> said such confrontations constitute a breach of an agreement reached in August 1988. `` We agreed, for example, that every effort should be made to ensure that our respective supporters would not be mobilized to harass, heckle, jeer and, in particular, provoke our opponents at public meetings and on tours,'' <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> recalled. `` I am therefore suggesting that we meet together again very urgently ... to review what has been taking place, and finalized more precise methods of closer communication,'' <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> replied quickly in a letter suggesting that they and their respective peace committees meet Monday to sign previously negotiated peace agreements for the constituencies in the <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andrew </LOCATION> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> parishes and then discuss the current situation. `` I consider that these proposals would send the right signals and the talks would be productive, based on the earlier discussions during this week between the chairmen of the two parties,'' <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, in his letter, had said the recent incidents of violence `` have given me very great concern,'' and he wondered whether `` deliberate acts of provocation'' were being organized and staged at the constituency level to discredit the Code of Conduct signed between the two leaders in August. Justice <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, the ombudsman for political matters, proposed over the weekend that both parties ban political motorcades which, he said, `` served no purpose other than providing a cover for the devotees of strife and the promoters of violence to do their destructive work.'' <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> said that the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> already has decided not to hold anymore motorcades. However, he said he would tour individual constituencies almost daily, and his parties' other candidates would be doing the same. What was important, he said, was that both sides already had agreed to provide each other at the national and constituency levels with their respective itineraries, a procedure which should be implemented as a matter of routine from now on. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> wrote that `` several candidates of the <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> share my own concern that political violence is once again rearing its ugly head'' and cited recent incidents in which <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> supporters were attacked in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andrew </LOCATION> parish. The prime minister also spoke of `` the near open warfare now taking place in the main urban centers of St. <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>, particularly Spanish town and <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, which culminated with the fire-bombing of the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> JLP </ORGANIZATION> on Friday night.''

 Investigators said Sunday they have no clues to the disappearance of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> and are increasingly worried about his safety. `` More than eight days after his abduction, we are more and more frightened,'' said Prosecutor <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutten </PERSON>. `` At the moment there is no change whatsoever in the situation.''

 Irish police said they found an <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> arms cache Sunday that included barrels, ammunition and tripods for powerful Soviet-made machine guns capable of shooting down helicopters. Police said the weapons and ammunition were found in a plastic container buried underground at a deserted farm at <LOCATION> Longfield </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monaghan </LOCATION>, near the border with <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. It was the fifth such discovery this year.

<TEXT>
 Sikh extremists dragged three Hindu men from their homes and hanged them to avenge the executions of two Sikhs convicted in the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, police said Sunday. The Saturday night attack in the village of <LOCATION> Ahema </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Khalan </LOCATION>, 21 miles south of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, was the second such incident reported since <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> were hanged in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> on Jan. 6 for Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s assassination. Senior police superintendent <PERSON> Suresh </PERSON> <PERSON> Arora </PERSON> said six or seven Sikhs entered <PERSON> Gian </PERSON> <PERSON> Chand </PERSON>'s home and took him and his brother, <PERSON> Madan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lal </PERSON>. Their uncle, <PERSON> Vir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhan </PERSON>, was taken from a neighboring house, and all three men were dragged to the village outskirts and hanged from a tree, <PERSON> Arora </PERSON> said. He said a note left near the bodies said the killings were in retaliation for the executions of <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who was convicted of assassinating Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who was convicted of conspiracy in the killing. The note bore the name of the <ORGANIZATION> Kalistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, one of several extermist groups waging a violent campaign for an independent Sikh nation, <PERSON> Arora </PERSON> said. On Jan. 11, four Hindu brothers were hanged in <LOCATION> Bhujiawali </LOCATION>, 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. A note found near their bodies warned that more people would be hanged because of the government executions. Sikh militants, who killed at least 2,440 people in northern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state last year, have killed more than 140 people so far this year. The radicals have been fighting for a separate nation since 1982, claiming members of their faith are discriminated against by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s Hindu majority Sikhs comprise only 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s population of 880 million but form a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state. Hindus account for about 80 percent of the national population. The Sikh faith has roots in both <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, meanwhile, about 4,000 Sikhs marched through the city to protest the executions. Men, women and children gathered in <LOCATION> Hyde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> before marching along <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kingsway </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> subway station near <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, the office of the Indian high commmmissioner, or ambassador. A police cordon separated the marchers from the commission. Five Sikh elders carrying swords and scimitars led the procession. Many marchers wore brightly colored turbans. On Sunday, medical student <PERSON> Dapinder </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, one of the march organizers, said: `` This procession is the first time that Sikhs have come together under one banner. There are no more factions, we are unified now and this is terrifying the Indian government.'' About 400,000 Sikhs live in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. There was one brief scuffle between police and a marcher, followed by a confrontation with more marchers, but an appeal for calm by the march stewards defused the situation.

 The government said Sunday that Iraqis can now write letters to state-run newspapers to criticize people `` who commit any action that could be harmful to society.'' The official radio said Information Minister <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussayif </PERSON> <PERSON> Jassim </PERSON> was asked by the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to permit such complaints.

A similar council order last week permitted people to write letters to the newspapers naming government officials who abuse their authority or violate regulations.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, taking a pause from celebrative inauguration events, attended a national worship service Sunday where he was recognized as the `` symbol of unity.'' The solemn interfaith `` National Prayer Service'' in the sanctuary of the ornate <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Cathedral served as a quiet, contemplative climax to a frenetic five-day inauguration festival. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> worshipped with some 3,200 others, top aides appeared on Sunday television interview shows to discuss the more secular matters of budget deficits and U.S.-Soviet relations. The new president and first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> kneeled and prayed silently when they entered the cathedral, and then joined Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, in a front pew. Presiding over the service was the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Episcopalian </PERSON> bishop of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who noted that the Bushes, Episcopalians themselves, had `` visited with us many times in the past.'' He said he hoped to see them often, and the Bushes had said previously that they intended to attend Sunday church services regularly. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> spoke of `` a nation united in the person of our president. He is our symbol of unity.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON>, minister of <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who delivered the principal sermon, said, `` We have come to pray for the reconcilation of the peoples of the nation.'' <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON> worried aloud about `` the destitute of our American Calcuttas'' and on behalf of `` the prisoners of the inner city within a few short blocks of this cathedral and beyond.'' He also urged compassion for the aged, for AIDS victims and for `` the prisoners of affluence and indifference.'' In this he took a page from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inauguration address of Friday, in which he said, `` My friends, we are not the sum of our possessions. They are not a measure of our lives.'' The Bushes and the other worshippers laughed when <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON> cited an old adage, `` Be careful for what you pray, you might get it.'' `` The former vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> prayed doubtless to become president, and now he has. And now we must all pray with him and for him,'' <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s oldest son, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 42, participated in the service, reading a litany and ending it with, `` God protect our mother and father.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> closed the service with the prayer that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself had used in his inaugural address on Friday: `` Use power to help people. ... There is but one use of power _ and it is to serve people.'' The Bushes joined the rest of the congregation in singing songs from the printed program, including `` Faith of Our Fathers,'' `` Amazing Grace,'' and <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s `` Ode to Joy.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who surprised top aides and startled White House reporters with several spur-of-the-moment appearances in public in recent days, remained for the most part behind the scenes Sunday. He hosted an afternoon reception for members of the inauguration committee and set aside the early evening to join his family in the White House residence theater to watch the Super Bowl on wide-screen television. After the game, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozelle </PERSON> and invited the victorious <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> 49ers to visit the White House. No date was specified. Just before going to church, he appeared briefly on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION>, where he'd taken grandson <PERSON> George </PERSON>, 12, for a walk. `` It's a great day,'' exclaimed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was wearing suitpants and a blue wind-breaker. He seemed ready to relax after attending a series of inauguration balls Friday, and two more parties on Saturday night. At a youth rhythm-and-blues party, he got up on the stage and strummed a gift guitar a few times. As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prepared for his first full week as president, his chief of staff, former <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> governor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, was describing how <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to consolidate the `` redirection'' of the country that had begun during <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s eight-year presidency. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face The Nation,'' said that while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted to maintain economic prosperity and continue <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s emphasis on a strong defense, he also planned to work hard on such vexing problems as homelessness, drugs, child care and education. He acknowledged that budget deficit problems would constrain the chief executive, but said that in the days between now and Feb. 9, when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to address a joint session, administration officials want to emphasize `` our commitment to these issues.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said `` a conservative president can be compassionate.'' But he refused to be tied down on whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s no-tax pledge would hold up for the next four years. `` I think what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people was that we will deal with the deficit, the fundamental issue, without raising taxes,'' he said. `` We are putting a blueprint to deal with the deficit that does not require taxes.'' But when asked whether the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promise was intended to be good for just one year, or four years, the chief of staff said the pledge should be sound `` as long as the climate of this country is appropriate for that commitment to stay in place.''

 Relatives of political prisoners jailed by the leftist government demanded a general amnesty on Sunday and protested forced labor in prison. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relatives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisoners </ORGANIZATION> marked the second anniversary of its founding by holding a meeting in the capital, where leaders charged the Sandinista government was denying family visits to political prisoners. `` The prisoners are being mistreated in jail and -LRB- the government -RRB- has denied them family visits for refusing to work,'' said <PERSON> Matilde </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, the group's president. She did not elaborate. She called for `` a total amnesty in the country'' for political prisoners. Ms. <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that 19 political prisoners have been on a hunger strike since Jan. 15 in the National Penitentiary System facility to protest the government's refusal to permit visits. The facility, which houses former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> who fought under the late dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, is located about 14 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The Sandinistas toppled <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in the 1979 guerrilla war. Some of the former guardsmen are serving prison terms of up to 30 years. An official with the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the prison, denied that prisoners were fasting. `` There is no hunger strike among the prisoners,'' the official said on condition of anonymity. He acknowledged that `` they refuse to work, which is a disadvantage for them.'' The official declined to elaborate. `` Normally, all of the prisoners who were closely linked with the Somoza system do n't work, they maintain a constant protest and are in complete disagreement with the penitentiary system,'' the official said. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said in December that there were 3,142 political prisoners, including former guardsmen and anti-Sandinista rebels, in Nicaraguan jails. Ms. <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> on Sunday disputed that figure. `` Throughout the country, there are more than 20,000 political prisoners, and this affects in all some 30,000 children,'' she said. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also said the government had released more than 1,300 prisoners in compliance with the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace plan signed by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in 1987. Also Sunday, Costa Rican security authorities said Sandinista troops shot and killed a young Nicaraguan trying to cross into <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 17, died Friday night while trying to get across the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in a tiny boat with 16 other young Nicaraguans, said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Costa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Costa Rican civil guardsmen reported that the Sandinista troops opened fire from a hilltop, he said in a telephone interview. A Nicaraguan <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official on Sunday disputed the report and said Nicaraguan troops exchanged gunfire with anti-Sandinista guerrillas along the border. <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> is home to more than 40,000 Nicaraguan refugees who have fled the economic crisis and civil war in their homeland.

<TEXT>
 Iranian authorities smashed a major drug ring and killed six of its members Sunday, while a tough new anti-narcotics law caused addicts and pushers to turn themselves in and heroin prices to soar, reports said. In the last few days, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has executed 75 people and arrested more than 1,000 people nationwide in what <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> termed `` the biggest crackdown on drug smuggling in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s history.'' Many addicts and pushers deserted their hideouts and turned themselves in to avoid arrest, said the reports monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. The agency said 50 users were handed over to rehabilitation centers but did not say what happened to the rest. Cafe owners previously tolerant of drug abusers on their premises were turning them away since the new law calls for prosecuting anyone who provides a refuge for them, the news agency said. Even friends and relatives of addicts and pushers were alerting authorities, it said. The anti-drug campaign caused heroin prices to jump four-fold Sunday, a day after the new anti-drug law went into effect, the Iranian news agency reported without giving any specific figures. In the northern <LOCATION> Mazandaran </LOCATION> province, three addicts committed suicide by taking large heroin doses and then electrocuting themselves, it said. The radio said the drug ring smashed Sunday was run by <PERSON> Habib </PERSON> <PERSON> Naroui </PERSON>, who operated in southeastern <LOCATION> Kerman </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Sistan-Baluchistan </LOCATION>. The broadcast said six members of his ring were killed in a raid by agents of the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kerman </LOCATION> komiteh, the government's main law enforcement agency. The report did not describe the confrontation or say how the dealers died. It said 280 pounds of opium were confiscated. In other raids Sunday, a man was arrested in the capital, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, with 22 pounds of heroin and 44 pounds of opium, the broadcast said. Two other men were arrested in <LOCATION> Kerman </LOCATION>, it said. The report said an unspecified number of people in another gang were arrested in the northern <LOCATION> Semnan </LOCATION> province and 145 pounds of opium were seized. Two other drug smugglers were arrested who operated in the capital and in central <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION> province, the radio said. It said without elaborating that a large sum of money and six vehicles were confiscated from them. The new anti-narcotics law that went into effect Saturday requires the death penalty for anyone convicted of possessing one ounce of heroin, codeine or morphine, or smuggling more than 10 pounds of opium or hashish.

 Anti-abortion and pro-choice activists held rallies Sunday marking the 16th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> case that legalized abortions. Thousands of abortion protesters marched in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, while large pro-choice rallies were held in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Asa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>, a lawyer and former federal prosecutor, told a crowd of several thousand people that the `` tide is changing'' toward reversal of <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. `` Change in direction is brought about by citizens at the grassroots level,'' <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> said. An estimated 4,500 abortion protesters marched in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> to the statehouse. There were no arrests. In downtown <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, about 1,200 banner-carrying marchers joined the March For Women's Lives. They were met at the <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> morgue by about 40 anti-abortion marchers. The pro-choice march was preceded by a rally at which <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> president, said, `` Some people want to save their souls by spilling the blood of innocent women. That is n't Christianity. It's hypocrisy. The church has no business dictating the policies of this country.'' After her remarks, many in the crowd turned, shook their fingers and yelled, `` Shame, shame, shame'' at the anti-abortion protesters, who stood across the street. About 500 women attending a <ORGANIZATION> Feminist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Super </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bowl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choice </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> vowed to continue supporting a woman's right to abortion. And in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, about 500 pro-choice demonstrators attended a candlelight rally in front of the federal courthouse. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, about 30 pro-choice demonstrators held a candlelight vigil Sunday night in front of Independence Hall, where the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution was signed. Organizers said the vigil emphasized that the freedom to have a legal abortion may be in jeopardy because of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to review a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law that declares life begins at conception <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Elentrio </PERSON>, a board member of the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said the small turnout was reflective of the timing of the vigil, not concern over the issue. `` They're -LRB- women -RRB- all home making snacks for their husbands because it's Super Bowl Sunday,'' she said. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, about 200 pro-choice protesters chanted during a march, `` No back alleys in the night, for safe abortion we will fight.'' Several pro-choice groups and abortion protesters came face-to-face. At the offices of Planned Parenthood of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, more than 500 opponents of abortion were met by 40 pro-choice demonstrators. The two sides faced each other from across the street, with each group singing, clapping and maintaining their distance. There were no arrests. `` Right-to-life is not a political issue,'' said Bishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, the leader of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> diocese. `` It has nothing to do with politics. It is a religious and moral question. It is not a matter for the politicians to decide. It is a religious and moral issue already decided by God.'' More than 500 people crowded <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s Faneuil Hall to hear Cardinal <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON> lead a rally against abortion. Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> read a proclamation declaring Sunday `` Respect for Life Day'' in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Outside Faneuil Hall, a small group of pro-choice protesters chanting and carrying signs led by longtime pro-abortion activist <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> picketed the building. `` I warn you now we are in danger of losing the abortion law,'' <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state pro-choice activists, who plan to collect 10,000 signatures in support of abortion rights, urged people to get involved. `` The right to choose is under severe attack from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, the change in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and from anti-choice extremists. Now more than ever the pro-choice majority has to show itself,'' said <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Herst </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Thousands of people were expected in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, on Monday for a protest organized by March for Life. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinegar </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said organizers hope to match last year's turnout, when police estimated that 50,000 people marched. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is scheduled to speak by telephone to the march.

 The federal government paid the equivalent of 13 percent of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s gross national product in interest alone on its internal debt in 1988, according to a report by the private <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. In contrast, the government paid little more than the equivalent of 6 percent of GNP to service its $ 106 billion foreign debt last year, the bureau said.

Economists blame heavy government borrowing to service the domestic debt as a major cause of inflation, which reached 51.7 percent last year.

<HEAD>Blow-Out Said to Be Averted in Norwegian North Sea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAVANGER, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Experts said Sunday a blow-out in the Norwegian section of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> had been averted after a critical natural gas leak Friday, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s national news agency <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> Saga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had maintained a high alert through the weekend after the gas leak Friday afternoon, when a hose connecting the drilling rig Treasure Saga with a blow-out preventor on the seabed broke. There were no injuries. The rig was drilling a well in the Albuskjell gas field in the Ekofisk oil and natural gas area in the southernmost part of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> section. Saga spokesman <PERSON> Bjoern </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenne </PERSON> said drilling was suspended `` and the blow-out preventor on the seabed quickly closed'' after the leak. `` The well pressure is high but stable. The situation is under control,'' <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. Boots <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, an American blow-out expert called in by Saga, told a news conference Sunday that the danger appeared to be over. `` As long as the -LRB- blow-out preventor -RRB- has withstood the pressure since Friday, it should continue to do so. Similar things have happened other places in the world,'' <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Stavanger </LOCATION>, 181 miles southeast of the Norwegian capital <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, on Saturday to assist <PERSON> Saga </PERSON>'s own security team in finding ways to reduce the well pressure and strengthen the blow-out preventor. On Saturday morning, Treasure Saga had been towed 500 feet away from the well site. Only 28 of the 75 rig workers remained onboard. <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> quoted Saga Security Chief <PERSON> Aksel </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnecke </PERSON> as saying a new hose was underway to replace the one which broke Friday and that a first attempt to strengthen the blow-out preventor will take place within a few days. Other alternatives include pumping more heavy drilling mud into the well to reduce pressure on the blow-out preventor, or eventually engaging another rig to drill a second well to relieve the pressure _ an operation which could take several months.

 The machinists at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> voted Sunday to ratify an agreement on a 6-year extension of a labor contract that expired nearly two years ago, a union official said. The pact, retroactive to April 1987, calls for $ 233.35 weekly in additional wages and benefits for each worker over six years and contains language for better job security for the 72 machinists, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group that includes 10 of the 14 unions at the Times. Members of the Eureka Lodge 434 of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> voted overwhelmingly to approve the contract, according to <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION>. However, the exact vote tally and details of the agreement were not available Sunday, he said. `` It's a good contract. I'm delighted that the machinists settled with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. Times spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> said, `` The Times is pleased the machinists union reached an agreement. This is the last of our unions to sign a 6-year agreement.'' Negotiators reached their agreement Thursday, just hours before a strike deadline. The union membership had rejected an earlier tentative settlement on Jan. 8 and authorized a strike at 12:01 a.m. EST last Friday, unless a new deal was reached. The machinists, who maintain and repair presses and other equipment, were the last of 14 unions to reach pacts with the Times covering wages, benefits and job security through March 1993. Their contract expired March 31, 1987. The contract agreements for the unions are similar, but issues of job security were different for various unions, and some are to be subject to further negotiations or arbitration.

<TEXT>
 A supermarket chain recalled certain packages of a store-brand ice cream Saturday because of possible exposure to ammonia gas during manufacture, a spokesman said. <ORGANIZATION> Stater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> recalled its brand of square-pack, half-gallon packages of ice cream in golden vanilla and chocolate flavors bearing the code 092289, said spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Reingrover </PERSON>. `` It's strictly a precautionary thing,'' he said. `` The recall is on all of that code, however we found very little product affected.'' The packages did not necessarily end up in all of <ORGANIZATION> Stater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>' 101 markets in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> but there was no way to determine which stores actually received the lot, <PERSON> Reingrover </PERSON> said. The code is printed on an end flap of the packages. Some of the ice cream in those packages may be discolored, have an off-flavor and ammonia odor. The ice cream was made for <ORGANIZATION> Stater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Knudsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> but no Knudsen products or other brands were affected, <ORGANIZATION> Stater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Reingrover </PERSON> said he did not know how many packages were in the recalled lot. Consumers were advised to return the ice cream to the store where they bought it to receive a refund. The ice cream was manufactured in late December and was in the stores for `` a very short period of time,'' <PERSON> Reingrover </PERSON> said. He did not know exactly when it was put into the stores. The contamination occurred because of a leak of ammonia gas from the system that freezes the ice cream during the manufacturing process, he said.

<TEXT>
 You ca n't get much farther from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> than northeast <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. But underneath the image of a blazing sun on a bright red sign, <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> opened the first West Coast Video stores in the second-largest city on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. After five years, scores of franchise contracts and the buyout of struggling <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, Ore.-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s franchise operations, <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> has grown into the largest video rental outlet in the world. `` Even from the start, our name had given the impression that we were a nationally-franchised company,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION>, the chain's founder and chief executive officer. `` We wanted a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> image _ flashing lights, tons of glitter.'' Laden with bright-red carpeting and wallpaper, tracer lights and, of course, movie posters, the West Coast Video stores have brought a franchise formula to what started as family-owned operations with little commitment toward growing nationally. `` It's gone big-time now'' and gone beyond the level of stores that were opened as a hobby, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Apple </PERSON>, executive editor of Video Insider, a trade magazine. `` Every day, mom-and-pop stores are closing. Our stores are replacing the mom-and-pop operations,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. Sitting behind his U-shaped desk in his overwhelmingly blue office _ nearly devoid of red _ Stone is a successful entrepreneur, but not altogether satisfied. Plans for 1989 are to increase growth from three franchises a week and one company store every 10 days to opening a new outlet every working day. Last year, after the acquisition of National Video for about $ 3 million in cash and the addition of 455 franchised outlets, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> had $ 180 million in revenue, according to <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Killion </PERSON>, company spokeswoman. That was up sharply from 1986 revenue of $ 11 million. In its December 1988 issue, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> magazine listed <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> as the fourth-fastest growing privately-owned company in the country, with sales jumping 22,653 percent between 1983 and 1987. As of Jan. 11, there were 650 stores, 455 of which came from <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>, 195 <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> franchises and 68 company-owned stores. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said the company has gone through periods when it grew too fast for the staff and equipment. But he is confident that with VCRs in 55 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> homes, the rental industry will continue to grow for another five to 10 years. Competition for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, however, may come from convenience and grocery store chains that set aside a rack or corner for movie rentals. Such stores can offer movie rentals at a lower rate because they do n't depend on rentals for their income. Also, convenience stores like 7-Eleven already have stores on street corners across the country. But according to <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>, people prefer to go to a store specializing in videos by a margin of three to one. He said customers are attracted by the selection and service provided by a video store. `` I see it very much as an industry that will continue to be dominated by video specialty stores with growing business in convenience stores,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Fairfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a market research firm specializing in the video business. Stone started <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> in September 1983 after he and his wife could n't find the movie they were looking for and thought the clerks were rude. `` We saw all these people walking into a retail outlet for one sole purpose _ to rent a movie,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. `` Here they're already in the store and not coming out with a movie.'' Several years ago, most video stores kept the tapes behind a counter and the customer was expected to walk up with a list of movies and ask the clerk which ones were in stock. Stone takes credit for introducing a new system, emulated by many, that displays an empty box for each copy of a movie in stock. When the customer picks up the box, he is assured of being able to rent the movie. Many stores will give a customer a free day's rental if the movie for a displayed box is not in stock. Occasionally, with franchisees who have taken a second mortgage on their house or invested their life savings in the store, it is difficult to convince them that giving away $ 2 worth of rentals will pay off if the customer comes back. At $ 35,000, <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>'s franchise fee is $ 6,000 higher than any other video franchiser, according to the Franchise Handbook, published by <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisc </LOCATION><LOCATION> . </LOCATION> Between $ 175,000 and $ 250,000 in capital is required to start a West Coast Video store.

 Pilots for <ORGANIZATION> Suburban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, a regional commuter service based in Reading, moved a step closer to a strike when they rejected the company's latest contract offer. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> 78 of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said union pilots voted almost unanimously against ratifying a contract proposal offered by the airline. He declined to say how many ballots were cast, but said 97 percent were against ratification. `` We either go back into mediation or we could go on strike within 30 to 60 days,'' <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said Saturday night after the ballots were counted in the Holiday Inn.

Under the existing contract, <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said, a newly hired co-pilot would start at $ 1,050 a month and a first-year captain earns $ 1,920 a month.

In its fourth annual `` Innovation Survey,'' Group <ORGANIZATION> EFO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> found that 34 percent of those responding rated <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> the most innovative corporation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, followed by <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hormel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> has gone against the tide in a lot of ways,'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogiba </PERSON>, president of Group EFO, said Friday His consulting firm, which specializes in consumer attitudes toward new products, is based in <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` They are a big company that is acting like a small company,'' <PERSON> Ogiba </PERSON> said. `` They've been willing to take risks and they've been willing to look at quite a wide variety of offerings to find out what the consumer really wants.'' The survey, released last week, was based on responses from 75 chief executives, corporate presidents, and directors of marketing, planning and development at some of the world's largest consumer goods companies, <PERSON> Ogiba </PERSON> said. It was co-sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> magazine. <PERSON> Ogiba </PERSON> noted that <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, N.J.-based <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> has introduced a string of hugely successful new product lines over the last several years, including the upscale `` Le Menu'' frozen dinners, Prego spaghetti sauce, <ORGANIZATION> Pepperidge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collection </ORGANIZATION> cookies and <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s Home Cookin' soups. The survey found what <PERSON> Ogiba </PERSON> calls an alarming lack of confidence in the way new products are developed. Eighty percent of those responding predicted that 83 percent of all new products introduced this year will fail and 33 percent said consumer research was unreliable. Sixty-two percent believe that products introduced this year will prove the same or less innovative than last year. Fifty-five percent felt product development lacked direction. <PERSON> Ogiba </PERSON> said his survey indicated that marketing executives have become mesmerized by the idea of convenience _ foods that can be stored easily or quickly prepared _ as the key selling point in developing new product lines or in coming out with new versions of products already on the market. Companies like <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, on the other hand, have gone to great lengths to explore other characteristics that will appeal to consumers, <PERSON> Ogiba </PERSON> said. Fifty-one percent of those surveyed named <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as the most innovative country in the world, followed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` The models of innovation are outside the company for most marketers today,'' <PERSON> Ogiba </PERSON> said. `` In some ways, managers are saying that their internally driven new product process is n't working and that a better, more successful approach lies elsewhere.''

<HEAD>Zambia Resumes Ties with IMF</HEAD>

 President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> said his Southern African nation accepted an offer by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to resume an economic restructuring program in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. In the text of an interview with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reporters issued Sunday, <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> said an accord with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> followed what he described as the fund's `` flexible stance toward needy countries''. Speaking with <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlez </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> will assist with homespun economic reforms adopted by his government since he severed ties with the fund in May 1987. `` They made soundings that they want to come back and we said: ` Yes, we are ready,''' <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> told the reporters. `` This should be on our own terms and they -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- should only come here to help us do what we are already doing,'' he said. Several senior officials of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> visited <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> in recent months to negotiate resumed loan assistance. Last year, the <LOCATION> Zambian </LOCATION> government cut state subsidies on some essential commodities and removed price controls on some items to prepare the way for a rapprochement with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. When <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> cut its ties with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 the government said the fund's economic austerity program was too harsh. That program called for a massive devaluation of the Zambian currency and the removal of subsidies on essential goods and corn meal, the staple food. Government troops shot dead 15 civilians in food riots in late 1986 after the government slashed its subsidy on corn meal in line with <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> demands.
