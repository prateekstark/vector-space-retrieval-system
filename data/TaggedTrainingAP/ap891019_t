<TEXT>
 First lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday night contradicted a published report that she weighs 135 pounds. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> said the press never gets anything right,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Just for starters, I was born weighing 135 pounds.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> addressed the 44th annual <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> Memorial Dinner, a fund-raiser that has been called the city's most famous non-political political event. Approximately 1,350 guests gathered in the <LOCATION> Waldorf-Astoria </LOCATION> hotel's <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballroom </LOCATION>, where they dined on filet mignon and chocolate hazelnut torte at $ 500 a plate. After straightening out the weight question, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> paused, then handed outgoing Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who was also on the dais, one of his own lines. `` How'm I doing, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON>?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, wearing a black and purple gown with her characteristic pearl choker, said she welcomed the chance `` to prove I'm more than just a pretty face.'' The glittering and often controversial <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> dinner always draws an array of politicians and other notables, often held shortly before a major election, though political hatchets are supposed to be buried for the night. The first lady said she loved <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>'s satirical look at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> politics and race relations, `` The Bonfire of the Vanities.'' `` But I never dreamed I'd get to address some of the characters in person,'' she said to cheers. This year's event drew the top contenders for <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, Democrat <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, who sat two seats apart on the dais and who, according to <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, shook hands. At last year's dinner, then-Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his presidential opponent, Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, traded witticisms just weeks before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the race for the White House. Also in attendance Thursday were <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> IV, the master of ceremonies; Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>; state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>; Fire Commissioner <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>; outgoing Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> and Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has sponsored the annual event since its inception in 1945, a year after <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> died. The proceeds always go to health care causes. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, governor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from 1923-1928, in 1928 became the first Catholic to be nominated for president. Past speakers have included <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the first Catholic elected president. Other speakers have been <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Gate Crashers Threaten Dilapidated Hall With Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A throng of gate crashers trampled spectators and nearly brought the roof of the dilapidated <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Conservatory crashing down in their desperation to hear the Italian opera company <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scala </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported. The government newspaper gave no account of casualties, however. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> police refused comment Thursday evening, and managers of the concert hall did not answer the telephone. In an article headlined, `` Requiem _ One Moment From Tragedy,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said in its Thursday editions that thousands of fans, yearning to hear the <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scala </ORGANIZATION> orchestra and chorus perform <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s Requiem, `` broke through a small cordon of police and rushed past the old women ushers into the hall, trampling the bodies of fallen spectators. `` A brawl erupted between the ticket-holders and those without tickets claiming their seats _ pirate connoisseurs of bel canto,'' it said. The newspaper blamed the crowd of unruly spectators for the near-tragedy, but also noted that the downtown <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> conservatory had been closed for 1 -LCB- years as dangerously unstable. `` Under pressure of the public, taking into account the fact that the capital happened to have no concert hall worthy of celebrities, it was reopened on condition of careful use,'' the newspaper said. On Wednesday night, `` the most terrible minutes came when the hall exploded into chanting and the roof beams began to shake,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. Every time maestro <PERSON> Riccardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Muti </PERSON> and the ensemble came out for an encore, `` the new storm of applause was one more turn of the deadly roulette wheel,'' it said. The newspaper noted that <PERSON> Mstislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashkenazy </PERSON>, world-famous former students of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Conservatory, are scheduled to play the hall in the future.

 A court dismissed charges against a teacher who whipped a 12-year-old boy so badly he had to be hospitalized for six weeks, saying she did it help him improve his grades, a newspaper reported today.

 The widow of actor <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON> has filed suit against <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> over distribution of royalties from two of his films.

 The first negotiations between the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and union officials since nearly 60,000 workers went on strike fizzled Wednesday after only four hours, and no new talks were scheduled, both sides said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> negotiators told the union through a federal mediator that they would not expand the economic package rejected by union members Oct. 3 but were willing `` to make adjustments within the framework of the original wage offer,'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release. `` Sounds like doubletalk,'' said union spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> after the talks ended. `` Our people want more money and less overtime.'' The talks were the first since Oct. 2, two days before the strike by members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> began. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> 751 members were n't surprised by the lack of movement Wednesday `` We figured after a couple of weeks of strike that the first meeting would have to serve as a door opener to successive meetings,'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. `` Today the company was kind of doing its tough guy act.'' The Machinists represent about 57,800 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers nationwide, including 43,300 covered by <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 751 </ORGANIZATION> in the Puget Sound area, 12,000 in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, 1,700 in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and a few hundred others at scattered sites in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and other states. Asked if union members were feeling financial pressure, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> 71, replied, `` I would think the company's feeling the pressure pretty good since nobody's in there -LRB- the airplane factories -RRB-.'' For <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, there have been growing reports of concern about delayed aircraft deliveries to <ORGANIZATION> Malaysia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest commercial airplane builder, has delivered seven planes during the strike. The company has refused to say how many planes it would have delivered normally. Eighty-five percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> voted to strike rather than take a three-year contract with wage increases of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent; bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first year and 3 percent the second; cost-of-living boosts virtually matching inflation; a cut in mandatory overtime to 160 hours a quarter from 200 hours; and higher benefits. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said a new offer would have to provide more money, benefits and cuts in mandatory overtime. An agreement would set a pattern for other labor negotiations at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, and traditionally sets the standard for the nation's aerospace industry

 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> says it's concerned over the fate of about 40 East Timorese reportedly arrested after a pro-independence protest while Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> was visiting the former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony last week. `` According to reports, some of those detained have been subjected to ill-treatment, including electrical shocks, by members of the -LRB- <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> -RRB- security forces,'' <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Wednesday. `` <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> believes that in view of the consistent and recurrent pattern of torture and ill-treatment of political detainees in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, those now in detention may be in serious danger of ill-treatment.'' The London-based human rights organization said the reports came from previously reliable church and journalism sources in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> territory, and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. On Oct. 12, as the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> was finishing his blessing to a crowd of 100,000 people in <LOCATION> Dili </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, about 20 young men shouting `` Viva independence!'' and `` Viva il papa!,'' unfurled banners in front of the altar.

Plainclothesmen flogged the demonstrators and seized their banners. The crowd scattered and about 100 more young men joined the fray, hurling chairs at policemen. <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> authorities made no announcement about arrests. According to Amnesty, five East Timorese who feared arrest reportedly took refuge at the home of Roman Catholic Bishop <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Belo </PERSON>, apostolic administrator of <LOCATION> Dili </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> has criticized <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s human rights record in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION> and called for a referendum to decide its political future.

 Police said rescuers using dogs, jackhammers and muscle found no survivors Wednesday in the rubble of Interstate 880, the elevated road turned into a giant concrete pancake and gnarled girders by the earthquake. More than 250 rush-hour commuters were feared buried in the section of the Nimitz Freeway, which collapsed during Tuesday evening's devestating 6.9-magnitude quake. Seven bodies were recovered by midday, and police said at least 86 people still were reported missing. At about 6 p.m., Mayor <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was telling reporters that a search had found no survivors when police Lt. <PERSON> Kristina </PERSON> <PERSON> Wraa </PERSON> interrupted to say one had been discovered. `` We have confirmed that there is one person alive, apparently in a car underneath the top level,'' <PERSON> Wraa </PERSON> said, adding that rescue workers had heard a voice and established physical contact with the victim. That report was later dismissed as erroneous by <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> police Capt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, who attributed it to a garbled communication between officers. `` There were noises coming from the area. ... We have located several individuals, none of whom are alive so there are no survivors at this point,'' <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deumejian </PERSON> claimed the collapse of I-880 was the result of substandard construction, although state transportation officials said the freeway, one of the oldest in the area, had been reinforced and was considered earthquake-safe. However, they said further upgrading had been planned. Rescue workers searched for victims in the twisted metal and concrete, and used a concrete saw to cut throug cement to each automobile. Search dogs covered all but two sections of the collapsed freeway and found no survivors, <PERSON> Wraa </PERSON> said. A helicopter brought in a remote-control backhoe late Wednesday afternoon. Officials planned to shore up the freeway with steel and wood piles to protect workers from a possible aftershock. The search was moving `` slowly and meticulously'' because the collapsed highway was like `` a house of cards'' that could crash down at any time, <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> said earlier. Shortly before dawn, a hook-and-ladder truck moved alongside the flattened section of I-880. It stopped periodically to allow firefighters to shine bright lights into gaps between the northbound upper deck and the southbound lower deck. Screams and the crash of metal brought bystanders to the scene on Tuesday. `` You could hear it crunching down _ but you could n't see anything. It was just a big white cloud,'' said witness <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> FitzGerald </PERSON>. `` You could hear people screaming for help.'' When the 18-block stretch of highway caved in, workers from businesses in the heavily industrial area ran to help, many bringing tall ladders and forklifts. Rescuers were able to pull one man alive from a car that was crushed to a height of 18 inches, said passer-by <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> MacIntyre </PERSON>. Emergency workers pulled a girl from the wreckage of another automobile. The fate of her parents and brother was unknown. A three-member surgical team had to amputate the right leg of a 7-year-old boy who was trapped in a car for seven hours. At 12:15 a.m., he finally was carried down a 20-foot ladder and taken to an ambulance. There were many heroes. <PERSON> Darius </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>, a 26-year-old cook, joined an impromptu rescue party. The group crawled as far as possible under the crushed road to help injured motorists. They used crowbars to pry open one car and tied ropes around an elderly man to lower him 20 feet to safety. `` Then we went on top of the second deck and just mostly got everybody down we could,'' he said. `` People were yelling and screaming.'' I-880 was built in 1957, and was reinforced in 1977 in the first phase of a three-phase anti-earthquake program, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> officials said. In the work, the road deck was tied to its supporting columns. The columns themselves collapsed, and the deck did not slip off the columns, transportation department chief engineer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. Further work to strengthen the road against earthquakes had been deferred pending an engineering study, <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said. Asked whether the freeway had been considered safe from earthquakes, <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said, `` there's no such thing as an earthquake-proof structure,'' but added he was shocked by the collapse. `` We thought it would withstand the maximum credible earthquake we could have in this area, anything that would happen in this area,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> called for an investigation of the collapse. `` I had assumed that the freeways were ... constructed with adequate standards so that they would be able to withstand a quake of this severity,'' he said.

 Just in time for Halloween, the <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> is publishing a `` Dictionary of Superstitions'' with 1,500 entries including stepping on cracks and knocking on wood. <PERSON> Moira </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatum </PERSON> said she and co-author <PERSON> Iona </PERSON> <PERSON> Opie </PERSON> found in seven years of research that many of today's superstitions are universal and harken back thousands of years beyond written history. `` Although we know it goes back 4,000 years to nature worship, the earliest written reference to knocking on wood is a 19th-century children's game,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tatum </PERSON> said. `` But the actual knocking on wood, or ` touch wood' as the British say, to save oneself after saying a boastful thing, originated in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> where they always knocked the underside of a table and said, ` May I not be bewitched.''' Ms. <PERSON> Tatum </PERSON> said putting together 494 pages of superstitions cured any fears she had of bad omens: `` After all that work, I am totally converted from those pagan ways.'' The superstition to avoid stepping on cracks dates back to the ancient Greek mythological character Persephone who was taken to the underworld by Hades, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Tatum </PERSON> said superstitions are especially common in tightly knit communities. `` The small communities of seamen or miners in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> are full of superstitions,'' she said. `` That's where you find the more obscure or arcane superstitions.''

 Two men were indicted Wednesday on charges they defrauded federal housing programs under investigation in a nationwide probe of waste and mismanagement at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would say these two cases are symptomatic of the types of cases you will see across the country in fraud on the government in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>. Named in separate indictments were <LOCATION> Zionsville </LOCATION> real estate agent <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cirillo </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cirillo </PERSON>, 37, made false statements to help applicants for low-income housing assistance obtain HUD-insured mortgages for properties for which <PERSON> Cirillo </PERSON> was the broker. Once the loans were approved, <PERSON> Cirillo </PERSON>'s company received profits from the sale of the properties and brokerage fees, the indictment said. In each of seven cases, the loans went into default, costing the government about $ 200,000, <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. If convicted, <PERSON> Cirillo </PERSON> could face up to 19 years in prison and a fine of $ 2 million. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, 36, is charged with embezzling $ 54,425 from February until April when his company, <ORGANIZATION> Closing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, acted as a closing agent at the sale of HUD-repossessed properties. If convicted, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> could face up to 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. A reporter's telephone calls to <PERSON> Cirillo </PERSON>'s home were not answered Wednesday and his business is no longer listed. The telephone at <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s office was disconnected and his home number is unlisted. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and congressional committees began investigating the federal housing agency after reports of widespread fraud and mismanagement that is expected to cost the government $ 6 billion.

 Space shuttle Atlantis soared into orbit Wednesday and its astronauts started the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> probe on a six-year, roundabout journey to Jupiter for the closest look yet at the colossus of the solar system. `` Galileo is on its way to another world; it's in the hands of the best flight controllers in this world,'' said Atlantis commander <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Earlier, concerns about <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear power supply were left behind as Atlantis lifted off flawlessly on its mission to carry the $ 1.5 billion space probe into orbit on the first leg of its trip. After Atlantis had made five trips around the world, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> was ejected from the cargo bay by springs at 7:15 p.m. EDT, precisely on schedule, over the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tex </PERSON>. The shuttle quickly moved away to put distance between itself and the space probe's rocket. The `` burn'' was an hour later over <LOCATION> Borneo </LOCATION> _ first for 2 -LCB- minutes, then for a minute, 45 seconds _ giving the 6,700-pound <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> the initial push toward <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, its first planetary port-of-call. `` On time and on schedule,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. `` It achieved earth-escape velocity and is now heading outbound toward the sun,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. A spacecraft can escape the Earth's gravity when traveling faster than 25,000 mph. The five astronauts spent their first hours in space giving a final electronic checkout to <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>, a probe so sophisticated that one <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> official dubbed it `` the Rolls-Royce of spacecraft.'' `` Everything looks real good,'' said astronaut <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucid </PERSON>, a one-flight veteran from <LOCATION> Bethany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, who had charge of the probe deployment. The crew members reported a few problems with their own ship as it orbited 184 miles above the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. One was with a cooling system that might cause them to have to return slightly earlier than planned in what a flight director called `` a worst-case scenario.'' `` You looked marvelous going up,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> told <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> as the winged spacecraft reached orbit after two launch postponements. `` I feel a lot better,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>, named after the 17th century discoverer of <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s moons, will use the laws of physics to get to <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>, the largest planet in the solar system, in 1995 Flying by <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> will cause it to gain momentum and so will two subsequent close encounters with Earth. Although concern over the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>'s 49.4-pound plutonium power supply was argued in court, it drew no protesters to the Kennedy Space Center on launch day. Environmentalists had argued that a Challenger-like accident could scatter deadly plutonium-238 over <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Nothing like that happened Wednesday, and even the weather cooperated. Clouds and rain threatened to halt the launch until the last minutes of the countdown, but the clouds suddenly dissipated and the shuttle darted into a bright blue sky, trailing a 700-foot geyser of fire. The 132-ton Atlantis has a crew of five for the mission that ends Monday with a landing at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> at 2:38 p.m. EDT. The $ 1.5 billion mission already was seven years behind schedule when <PERSON> Atlantis </PERSON> was grounded by rain at the last minute Tuesday and by a faulty engine computer last week. `` It feels great,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> chief scientist <PERSON> Lennard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> after liftoff. `` It's been a long time.'' Apart from <PERSON> Lucid </PERSON>, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' crew consists of pilot <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCulley </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON>. The liftoff was the start of a voyage that will take the probe on a looping path past <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> in February, back to within 620 miles of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> in December 1990 and past <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> again at a 200-mile altitude two years later. The craft will arrive at <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> in Deceber 1995 for a two-year orbit. As part of the mission, a robot will separate from the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft and plunge through Jupiter's gaseous atmosphere. Scientists hope to gain insight into the birth of the solar system by studying Jupiter, which holds original material from that event 14 billion years ago. The planet's diameter is about 11 times that of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and its mass 318 times greater. The mission originally was to have started in 1982, but money ran out. Then came the Challenger explosion in January 1986, delaying all shuttle flights for three years and prompting a change in the rocket to propel the Galileo. The mission originally was budgeted at $ 425 million. It will climb to $ 1.9 billion by the time <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> finishes a 10-orbit trip around Jupiter in 1997. The sweeps past <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> will take advantage of the planets' gravity to accelerate the spacecraft to the proper speed to reach its distant target. Small onboard motors will fine-tune the flight path. The Galileo's electricity will be generated by decaying radioactive pellets of plutonium-238, which causes cancer and death in humans if inhaled in minuscule amounts. Environmental activists feared not only a launch accident but also mishaps during the two flybys. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> convinced a federal judge that the plutonium containers could withstand such pressures and that even if there were a release of radioactivity there would be no appreciable health effects. The government had hundreds of experts in the launch area _ just in case _ to monitor any radioactive release. More than 200 guards on foot, in helicopters and boats patrolled the launch center for protesters who said they might try to stop the launch by infiltrating the launch zone and sitting on the launch pad. `` We've succeeded in a small way calling attention to the escalating plan to put nuclear energy into space, including in Star Wars,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>. `` The real fundamental point is that people have n't been doing much more than ooo-ing and ahhh-ing at the launches. They have n't been considering the moral and ethical issues of what is in these things, where they are going and what they are doing.

 A 100-year-old man sliced into the world's biggest cake to mark this town's 100th anniversary. The 128,238-pound, 12-layer cake _ 32 feet wide, 80 feet long and shaped like the state of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> _ was unveiled Wednesday at the local fairgrounds before 6,000 people. The country band <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, who hail from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Payne </LOCATION>, sang `` Happy Birthday.'' <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> cut the cake with a sword and helped serve pieces. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gengozian </PERSON>, editor and publisher of the local newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, came up with the idea of baking the birthday cake because the <ORGANIZATION> EarthGrains </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> bakery is the town's largest employer, with 750 workers. He set a goal of topping a 90,000-pound cake baked in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, for the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sesquicentennial in 1986. The Guinness Book of World Records lists that cake as the heaviest ever made. Guinness approved construction plans for the Fort Payne cake but still must verify it as a record. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, who supervised the baking of cake by <ORGANIZATION> EarthGrains </ORGANIZATION>, said it contained 33,238 pounds of cake flour, 21,980 pounds of sugar, 11,799 pounds of corn syrup, 608 pounds of vegetable oil, 161 pounds of vanilla flavoring, 1,206 pounds of baking powder, 568 gallons of powdered milk, 19,250 pounds of water and 429 pounds of salt. The icing added another 33,354 pounds of ingredients, mostly sugar. A local metal company provided the steel supports to keep the cake from collapsing under its own weight. The <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in the town of 12,000 said the cake required $ 25,000 in ingredients, paid for with donations.

 After 35 years, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> still gets teased about being replaced by a dog in <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>'s famous picture `` Breaking Home Ties. `` I've been razzed about this quite a bit,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, 84. `` I knew that he changed the faces of the people in his portraits, but this was a little drastic.'' According to a <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> exhibit at the <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the artist had initially envisioned both a grieving mother and a father in his 1954 painting of a young boy leaving home for the first time.

The couple sat for several photos in <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>'s studio with the artist himself playing the anxious son. But when <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> finally got around to painting, he replaced Mrs. <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> with a big collie. She said one of her friends attempted to console her with the advice, `` Do n't feel so badly, dear. It's a beautiful dog.''

 When the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area was slammed this week by a catastrophic earthquake, <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> was one of the few who remembered one even more terrible. `` This was a really heavy one ... -LRB- but -RRB- 1906 was the worst one,'' the 91-year-old woman said Wednesday from her daughter's house in suburban <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, where she was recovering from injuries suffered in Tuesday's quake `` The city was in flames. We were all sitting on the sidewalk. ... There was no water, no medical care. We are all advised to go to higher ground. I was 7. You did n't know where to run.'' The memory of a stronger jolt did n't make Tuesday any less terrifying, Mrs. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said. `` I was sitting in a rocking chair. It started to swing and sway. Finally it gave a big jolt ... like a ship on the sea,'' she said. She fell from the chair, hurting her wrist, fingers, knee and leg. Her screams alerted the manager of the senior citizen's apartment complex, who helped carry her to her bed She spent the night without electricity in a dark, frightening city. `` It was horrifying,'' she said. `` Every two hours, an aftershock. A fear, a terrible feeling, to think everything will be destroyed.'' On Wednesday morning, her daughter, <PERSON> Jeanette </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, and Mrs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' husband took her into their home, 30 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, to recover. The daughter of immigrants from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, she was 1 when her family moved from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Her father, who spoke little English, did maintenance work in theaters here. Six years after her family arrived, the mightiest earthquake in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history struck. The 1906 quake, estimated at 8.3 on the open-ended <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, was followed by an even more destructive fire. The temblor was more than 10 times as powerful as Tuesday's quake, which registered 6.9 `` The buildings sunk into the ground,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> recalled. `` My mother and I were walking around, going to Twin Peaks with a blanket,'' she said of the scenic area. Her father went down into the fire area with another relative to clean and stack bricks, she said. Their Mission District house was the only one on the block to survive, but they had to seek higher ground to escape the smoke, she said. They moved to another neighborhood, and she has remained in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> all her life, working at times as a typist and taking part in dog shows. She also has attended some of the annual commemorations of the April 18, 1906, quake. Like most Californians, she lives near active fault lines in the earth and has gotten used to periodic earthquakes. But when Tuesday's quake began, she said, `` I said to myself, ` This has gone too far.'''

 Need to pick up some helicopters, light armored vehicles and tank ammunition for your country's defense? The easy answer is one-stop shopping _ military style _ with the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. With the blessing of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the association is holding its annual meeting this week featuring the customary big-name speakers such as former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and information panels on topics like Soviet forces and national security. The main attraction, however, is the approximately 200 defense industry and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> exhibits on every imaginable aspect of weaponry. `` The exhibits ... reflect the latest in military doctrine, technological advances and hardware improvements,'' says the association, which has held what it touts as `` the largest landpower forum in the free world'' for the past 35 years. Among the items on exhibit in the bowels of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel were a full-scale light armored vehicle, a handful of howitzers and several high-tech videos promoting helicopters, M-16 machine guns and night-vision goggles. Beribboned officers, fresh-faced cadets and defense industry officials created traffic jams as they grabbed glossy brochures, closely examined the rifles and handguns and questioned the hundreds of company representatives. Some sat transfixed as they watched a sophisticated video on the LHX helicopter displayed on 16 television monitors. It was a combination of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> and Top Gun. `` Time to smell the coffee, sucker,'' said the helicopter pilot as he maneuvered his aircraft through mountain ranges and green valleys and located his target with the help of a British-sounding female voice. `` Have a nice walk home, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON>,'' the pilot said after a successful hit. But beyond all the glitz, there was serious business as officials from <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> briefed representatives from foreign countries and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on their latest wares. For the buyer who ca n't afford to fly from one company to the next, the meeting provides a `` great place for networking in a marketing environment,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, an official with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, as he stood in front of the company's 14 1 @ 2-ton light armored vehicle equipped with a 25mm gun. The meeting, according to <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, is strictly for the buyer who wants to browse. `` No contracts. We do n't even talk about contracts. If we did the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary could not endorse it,'' he said. `` Those types of things are verboten.'' Instead, the companies tout the advantages and successes of their products with the hope that a telephone call or meeting at a later date will result in a sale. General Motors' light armored vehicle is ideal for low-intensity conflicts and in fact, 14 of them were flown into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> when the rebel forces led a failed coup against leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> official. The vehicle has `` great acceleration, a low silhouette, when it's smaller it's harder to hit, great mobility,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. Like in a car showroom where prospective buyers kick the tires, people have come up and knocked their knuckles on the vehicle and said, `` Oh boy, this is it,'' he said. On the other side of the room, in front of a large video screen, representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> praised the V-22 Osprey, the aircraft that takes off like a helicopter but flies like a plane. Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, in his budget for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, proposed killing the program. The move was met with opposition on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> where the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> aircraft enjoys a great deal of popularity. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees hammering out a final defense bill have not yet reached a decision on the aircraft. But <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> is convinced the Osprey is key to the nation's defense. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> may be here in jail now if we had the V-22,'' the company official said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>'s first song, `` One Life To Life,'' contained the line `` If I'm in town, I want to be the toast of it.'' On Wednesday and Thursday she can claim to be the toast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where she has come from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to sing the first two nights of `` Cabaret Comes to Carnegie'' in Weill Recital Hall. Miss <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>'s biography does n't include her age but it says that she made her Broadway debut in 1923, in `` Runnin' Wild.'' The sweet but distinctive timbre of her voice is n't a great deal different from her vintage recordings and she sings with remarkable control. But a long time lived infused at least two songs with a special glow. They were <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>'s `` Song on the Sand,'' a mellow looking back at falling in love, and <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coward </PERSON>'s `` I'll Follow My Secret Heart,'' sung in a soft, reminiscent mode. Miss <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> recounted how, in 1930, she was singing in cabaret here when three friends of <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> came to hear her sing `` Love for Sale.'' They recommended that she sing it in the Broadway show `` The New Yorkers,'' which she did. Later, when she was singing in cabaret in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> sent for her and said he had a song for her in a new <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> show to star <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. `` Let's face it, who stays in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>?'', Miss <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> asked. She sang <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s `` Solomon'' in `` Nymph Errant'' in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 1933 and sang it at Weill Recital Hall on Wednesday. Her voice wavered on the title word, which is held long, and on the exposed long lines of `` September Song'' her voice wavered again, somehow in an endearing way. The singer made the cabaret staple `` Miss Otis Regrets'' unusually amusing. She said of <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, `` Songs seemed to come from her inner depths. She had a great sadness about her.'' She sang a <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> specialty of Miss <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s, `` Why Was I Born?'', and made it strong but not very sad.

 Actress <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> observed life in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>'s largest slum on a mission to publicize the plight of the hungry, downtrodden children of the world. <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund, also met Wednesday with <PERSON> Prateep </PERSON> <PERSON> Hata </PERSON>, known as the `` Slum Angel of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>.'' `` I am full of admiration for this marvelous angel as she is called.

<HEAD>Drug Makes Transplants Cheaper, More Successful</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A drug that improves the success of kidney transplants also helps reduce medical bills by shortening the length of hospital stays, according to a study published today. Among patients receiving new kidneys, hospital bills totaled an average of $ 28,649 for those receiving the anti-rejection drug cyclosporine and $ 37,895 for those who did not, a 24 percent difference, according to the study. Patients receiving the drug were discharged from the hospital in three weeks rather than five, according to research directed by <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Showstack </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The drug keeps the body from rejecting the foreign organ. The study said the medicine improved the chances of a successful kidney transplant from 60 percent to 80 percent. The research, published in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, was based on studies of 702 patients who received transplants between 1982 and 1986, the period during which cyclosporine became widely available. Doctors from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, said Wednesday a new drug code named FK-506 appears to be even more effective and less toxic than cyclosporine. Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON>, who pioneered the use of cyclosporine, said the new drug could make transplants cheaper still by speeding recovery and reducing the need for tests. In a separate report in the journal, Dr. <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowie </PERSON> of Social & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, directed a study showing that black people with diabetes are more likely than whites with the disease to suffer kidney failure. Diabetes is the underlying cause of about one-quarter of all cases of kidney failure in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and blacks are about three times more likely than whites to have diabetic kidney failure. However, it was unclear whether this was simply because blacks are more likely to get diabetes. The new study, based on 470 blacks and 861 whites in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, found that the incidence of diabetic kidney failure was 2.6 times higher among blacks, even when their higher prevalence of diabetes was taken into account. An accompanying editorial by Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostand </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> said the increased risk may result in part from racial differences in kidney function. However, better control of blood sugar and blood pressure could improve blacks' chances of escaping kidney failure.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee says Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, D-Calif., could face <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> disciplinary action if he repeats harassment of female staffers or permits any more campaign activities in his office <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> was informed by the committee Wednesday that he violated a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rule prohibiting sexual harassment and an ethics guideline barring campaign work in a congressional office. `` Your improper conduct and concurrent violations of relevant standards deserve reproval,'' the four-term <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> was told in a letter from <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif. and ranking Republican <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> The panel declined to recommend disciplinary action by the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which could range from a reprimand to expulsion in the most extreme cases. But the committee warned <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> that `` any further violation by you in the areas which were the subject of the ... inquiry may result in a recommendation that disciplinary action be considered by the House.'' The panel began a preliminary inquiry against <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> after a complaint last October by two women who had worked in his congressional office. The women, who had left <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>' office before filing their complaint, said he sexually harassed them while they were employees and pressured congressional staffers to do campaign work. The committee acknowledged <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> has apologized to `` anyone who may have been offended'' by his personal conduct, but deemed that action insufficient. <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> was directed to write the women, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dorena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertussi </PERSON> `` apologizing for behavior which was sexual harassment, copies of which should be provided to this committee.'' <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> told reporters he allowed a campaign employee to make fund-raising calls from his office and later hired the worker for the congressional staff. <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> told reporters, `` I accept the committee's judgment,'' he said, adding, `` Times are changing. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are going to be scrutinized for their personal and professional behavior. `` Sexual harassment is very serious and not to be taken lightly. I did not know what sexual harassment meant until this came up.'' The rule cited by the committee states: `` A member, officer or employee of the House of Representatives shall not discharge or refuse to hire any individual, or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex or national origin.'' The ethics committee's manual for members states, `` Official allowances may not be used to defray any personal, political, or campaign-related expenses.''

<HEAD>Trade Agreement With Canada Will Help Vegetable Sales, Expert Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The new long-range trade pact with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> should help boost consumer demand for fresh vegetables on both sides of the border, perhaps by 25 percent overall, says <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON>. The U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, which took effect last Jan. 1, removes many trade restrictions between the two countries. A major benefit down the road will be the elimination of all agricultural tariffs within 10 years. <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON>, who works for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, took a look at the trade agreement's impact on vegetables. Her findings are reported in a forthcoming issue of Farmline magazine. Why focus on vegetables, when there are other larger and more glamorous export commodities such as grains and meat to study? `` Everybody asks that question,'' <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> said Wednesday in a telephone interview. `` Do n't feel that I take it personally.'' But something `` totally different'' had to be found for her doctoral dissertation, and vegetables were it, she said. `` Also, international trade in vegetables is growing quite a bit,'' <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> said. `` While it's not one of our major crops like soybeans or corn, it's growing in importance and is something that needs to be looked at.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> are each other's largest export markets, overall, the report said. More than 18 percent of last year's total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports were from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, while almost 22 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports went to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. But agriculture makes up only a small portion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the report said. And of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural export total, only about 5 percent went to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in the 1980s. According to the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> imports around $ 3 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural products annually, including an average of about $ 450 million worth of vegetables and $ 650 million worth of fruit. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> forecasts 1989-90 agricultural exports to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> at a value of $ 2.2 billion but adds that in recent years these figures `` have been under-reported by an estimated $ 1 billion annually'' and is officially recognized by both governments. Agricultural imports from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in 1989-90 are forecast at about $ 2.8 billion, according to current <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> figures. The department's official estimate of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural export value in the year that began Oct. 1 is $ 40 billion. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the biggest single-country market at $ 8.1 billion, followed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, $ 3.5 billion; <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, $ 2.5 billion; <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, $ 2.4 billion; and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, $ 2.2 billion. With the complete elimination of tariffs, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand for Canadian vegetables would increase about 80 percent from today's levels, and Canadian demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vegetable would go up 30 percent, according to <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON>' study

 The share of commodity marketings by farm cooperatives has declined from levels of the early 1980s, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. In 1987, the most recent year examined, co-ops accounted for 25 percent of farm marketings, down from 27 percent in 1985 and 28 percent in 1982. Grain marketings by cooperatives were reported at 29 percent of the total, down from 33 percent in 1985 and 36 percent in 1982. That includes sales of oilseeds except for cottonseed. `` Much of the decline has been the result of less cooperative involvement in grain and oilseeds marketing,'' the report by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The co-op share of milk marketed was 76 percent in 1987, compared with 78 percent in 1985 and 77 percent in 1982. Cotton marketings were 38 percent, 33 percent and 36 percent, respectively, and livestock at 7 percent, 8 percent and 11 percent. Fruit and vegetable marketings by co-ops accounted for 23 percent of the total in 1987, up from 8 percent in 1985 and 11 percent in 1982. Cooperative shares of production supplies sold to farmers also dropped by similar percentages, to 25 percent in 1987 from 27 percent in 1985 and 28 percent in 1982, the report said. However, not all items declined accordingly. Supplies included: fertilizer, 43 percent of the total in 1987, 44 percent in 1985 and 42 percent in 1982; petroleum, 37 percent, 44 percent and 36 percent; farm chemicals, 28 percent; 29 percent and 34 percent; seed, 19 percent, 15 percent and 17 percent; and feed, 17 percent, 16 percent and 18 percent.

 The powerful earthquake that jolted the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area forced a holiday on tens of thousands of people, who poured into the rubble-littered streets to gawk at nature's might Amid the balmy weather that encouraged throngs clad mostly in shorts and T-shirts, there were scenes of devastation and others _ like the soup line of 1,000 outside Glide Memorial Church in the seedy <LOCATION> Tenderloin </LOCATION> district _ emblematic of more permanent misfortunes. The disaster brought out the spectator in many, but others pitched in to help the homeless and distraught. `` This is an incredible coming together; an act of the brotherly love that <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciscans </LOCATION> were famous for in the'60s,'' self-described `` ex-hippie'' <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said as he helped people clear rubble from a collapsed building. The dawn of a flaming sun, colored through wisps of fog in the hills east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, painted streets in rose tones as residents and hundreds of stranded visitors awoke a day after the quake, unsure of what awaited them. Thousands arose from a night in emergency shelters, hundreds more from makeshift tents in city parks and rural lots. Most had spent more than 12 hours without heat or light. But the vast majority of the region's 6 million residents made it through the night in largely undisturbed comfort. As they mingled on the streets by the hundreds in cities ranging from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coastal community of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, they became a portrait of contrasts. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Golden Gate Park, joggers huffed in the bright high-noon sun. Temperatures reached the high 70s by late afternoon. A couple walked their two dogs. A lone man sunbathed on a knoll near the towering band shell. While sprinklers in the well-to-do <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district saturated expansive, manicured lawns, many residents of collapsed sections of the neighborhood were forced into a <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cross </LOCATION> shelter, where they quickly ran out of water. A Mendocino water company donated a truckload of bottled water. The traditional daily crowd of tattered homeless people at Tenderloin churches was swelled by hundreds of elderly hotel dwellers and Southeast Asian refugee families. They came to the church hoping to eat their first meal since the quake. The Marina, at the northern end of the city inside the Golden Gate, is renowned for its narrow, curving streets, with such names as <LOCATION> Alhambra </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cervantes </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Mallorca </LOCATION>. The streets are lined with neat, handsome homes and apartments, most finished with light-colored stucco and many with tile roofs. But the area, built on fill land, was the hardest hit of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s neighborhoods. On Wednesday, it contained scenes like this: Next to the crumpled, charred rubble of a three-story apartment complex, an elderly woman gingerly dusted a delicate crystal lamp. A helicopter tour of the Bay Area beginning at daybreak revealed billowing smoke pouring from a block of the Marina nearly flattened by a fire that broke out after the quake. Two joggers ran by, trying to step over firehoses without breaking stride. The grand sandstone structure of the Palace of Fine Arts, built for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, was draped in smoke from the devastated buildings two blocks away. The neighborhood of bungalows and Victorians looked as if a giant invading creature had taken two steps and then turned back. The silver strand of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> gracefully cut through the foggy haze, marred only by lines of orange hazard cones blocking traffic. A collapsed 50-foot section of the upper level looked like nothing more than one pasteboard in a fallen house of cards. On either side of the bridge, the green-and-yellow pennants of the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> and the black-and-orange of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> flapped at each other in the light morning breeze, with no motorists to cheer them on. On the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> side of the bridge, a collapsed section of Interstate 880 looked like it had melted in a scorching sun. On the nearby beaches of <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>, scores of sun bathers took advantage of canceled school or work. At <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, the historic Boardwalk amusement park was spotless but without visitors, while hundreds of people stood in block-long lines at the few supermarkets open to the public in a city largely devoid of power and potable water.

 Some lawmakers are vowing to restore <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s $ 23,000 military retirement pay, saying <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> never intended for its anti-shredding law to deprive the convicted Iran-Contra figure his pension. `` Regardless of what happened in the Iran-Contra affair, people have a difficult time understanding why he is being denied the pension that he earned,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to vote Nov. 3 on a bill that would exempt North from the penalty which was imposed after he was convicted July 5 on charges of shredding government documents and two other felonies. North is appealing the convictions. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., said he will draft a report for the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that outlines the arguments on both sides of the politically divisive issue `` We've got to solve this thing. We've got to make this thing square for everybody,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> told reporters after a hearing on Wednesday on the matter. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> suggested lawmakers should deal not just with <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s case, but with the pension rights of any federal official _ including members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ convicted of a felony North's retirement pay was $ 23,000 a year. He is reportedly getting $ 25,000 for each speech he gets on the lecture circuit. The law under which the pay was revoked provides that anyone convicted of shredding protected government documents `` shall forfeit his office.'' The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which has jurisdiction over federal pay matters, ruled <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s status as a retired military officer came under that provision of the law and that forfeiting his office meant he no longer qualified for retirement pay. Some conservatives who view <PERSON> North </PERSON> as a hero who bore the brunt of blame for the Iran-Contra scandal were outraged at the decision. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, have said the retirement pay should be restored. But Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s sentence was too lenient and the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> was right to deny him retirement pay. `` We are sending the wrong message when people violate the public trust and get off with only a slap on the wrist,'' he said. Legal scholars told the Judiciary panel <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should answer whether the law meant for `` office'' to include military positions. Technically, military retirement pay is not a pension based on past service but a reduced salary for an officer who continues to hold a commission and remains subject to recall to active duty. North `` very well may be entitled to his pension,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said. `` Whatever we do, there should be a basic equity'' with other cases. But he acknowledged, `` It's not going to be divorced from politics.''

 Two men convicted in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s longest and costliest criminal trial for a conspiracy to wring millions from a billion-dollar Arctic construction binge have been sentenced to seven years in prison. Lobbyist <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dischner </PERSON> and businessman <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathisen </PERSON> also will forfeit more than $ 11 million as a result of their convictions earlier this year on extortion, racketeering and fraud charges. The advisers to former North Slope Borough Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Brower </PERSON> pocketed millions in kickbacks and sent construction contracts to companies they secretly owned, prosecutors said. The construction program was aimed at providing 20th century comforts for the nation's northernmost communities. `` Any mistakes I've made, I'm really sorry,'' <PERSON> Dischner </PERSON> said Wednesday before he was sentenced. `` I hope I have n't hurt anybody.'' <PERSON> Mathisen </PERSON> stopped short of apologizing, saying, `` If they -LRB- the jury -RRB- were right and I was wrong, then I'm truly sorry.'' Former <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaan </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> to sentence each defendant to 15 years in prison. He said the stiff sentence might deter other would-be white-collar criminals. <PERSON> Spaan </PERSON> said he was pleased with the sentences, adding, `` I think the judge tempered the sentence with mercy.'' <PERSON> Dischner </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, had asked that his 71-year-old client receive a three-year sentence, to be served at a minimum-security prison. `` A 15-year sentence, as we all know, and we should not kid ourselves, is a death sentence for <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dischner </PERSON>,'' he said. <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Finegold </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mathisen </PERSON>'s lawyer, asked that his client receive probation because of his poor health, or that he serve his term at his home. But <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said he considered <PERSON> Dischner </PERSON>'s age and <PERSON> Mathisen </PERSON>'s medical condition, which includes a heart ailment and ulcers, when fashioning their sentences He recommended that the two serve their terms in a minimum-security prison. He said he did not order restitution because it would have cost the government too much and taken too long to determine how much the two owed the borough. The judge said the borough could pursue payment through the courts. Dischner, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> activist and labor commissioner in former Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>'s administration, was convicted May 22 on 21 counts, including racketeering, extortion, and wire and mail fraud. The jury acquitted him on four income tax counts. <PERSON> Mathisen </PERSON>, 56, a businessman with close ties to the North Slope dating back to the early 1970s, was convicted on 22 counts. Dischner and <PERSON> Mathisen </PERSON> each received seven years on a pair of racketeering and racketeering conspiracy counts, and five years each on the other counts. <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> ordered all terms to run concurrently. The federal racketeering statute under which the two were convicted allows the government to seek forfeiture of money and property obtained illegally. That would require a second trial, but the two waived their right to another day in court. <PERSON> Dischner </PERSON> agreed to forfeit $ 5.8 million; <PERSON> Mathisen </PERSON> $ 5.7 million. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Dischner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mathisen </PERSON> used lavish gifts to manipulate <PERSON> Brower </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty to tax evasion in exchange for his testimony. <PERSON> Brower </PERSON> was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $ 5,000. Prosecutors said payments to Dischner and <PERSON> Mathisen </PERSON> added $ 73 million to the Minnesota-sized borough's billion-dollar building boom. They said the two men pocketed $ 21 million while <PERSON> Brower </PERSON> was mayor from 1981 to 1984.

 The president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientists </ORGANIZATION> says the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is violating the law by providing military supplies and advisers to allies of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, at a news conference Wednesday, said the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is still run by <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, who killed 2 million Cambodians when he controlled the country from 1975 until 1978. `` These people are beyond the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, who met last month with Thai leaders, said <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> may be prepared to reduce its support to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, two other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, `` are not in favor of the old line'' against <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> Prime Minister Hun Sen. `` We should support <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> as the main bulwark against the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic leaders are becoming increasingly vocal in challenging strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, even at the risk of seeing some priests expelled from the country. The latest sign of troubled relations between church and state involved the deportation Tuesday of Sister <PERSON> Elsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaus </PERSON>, the Peruvian-born principal of a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> girls school. Sister <PERSON> Schaus </PERSON>, who had lived in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for 26 years, was told by immigration officials she was being expelled for `` state security reasons and for her own safety.'' Some church officials also said officials mentioned problems in her treatment of the daughters of government and military officials. `` Whatever the reason, there is no relationship between a matter of school discipline and the expulsion from the country of the school's director,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Guardia </PERSON>, vicar of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> archdiocese. The church's relations with the government have been prickly since the early 1970s. In 1971, the Rev. <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallego </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> priest, disappeared while organizing peasants in western <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> de Veraguas province. Church officials say he was slain and blame the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> now commands. Most church schools have traditionally served middle - and upper-class civilian families, where opposition to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is concentrated However, growing numbers of affluent military and government officials have been sending their children to these schools in recent years. Making matters more complex, 220 of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 297 Catholic priests and 424 of its 482 nuns are foreigners, mostly from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Government and military officials are in many cases especially wary of the foreign clery. `` The government regards the church as an enemy,'' said <PERSON> Guardia </PERSON>. `` Because of the large number of foreign priests, it is a direct threat to the church when the government threatens to expel the foreign priests.'' However, <PERSON> Guardia </PERSON> said the church will not be deterred in its campaign against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, even though Sister <PERSON> Schaus </PERSON>' expulsion `` would seem to indicate the beginning of another campaign against the church.'' `` But the church will continue its campaign to make people aware of their diginity as human beings, of their human rights, because the gospel is a message of liberation,'' he added. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been cracking down on his opponents since federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted him on drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges February 1988. He survived a second military coup attempt on Oct. 3 and has renewed efforts to eliminate opposition and consolidate power. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been closing down opposition news media and canceled May 7 national elections when the returns showed that opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> was winning by a 3-1 landslide. <PERSON> Panorama </PERSON> <PERSON> Catolico </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> diocese weekly newspaper, is the only opposition medium left in the country. It is sold at churches every Sunday. Last week, it printed in a black box on the front page a prayer for `` the dead, the wounded and their families.'' It was a clear reference to the rebels from the latest attempted coup, 10 of whom were killed. And in a letter in Panorama on Sept. 17, the nation's bishops `` noted with sadness that the people's will expressed in the presidential elections has been ignored and the problems of our people ... get worse every day.'' Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> then angered the government-controlled news media with an article deploring `` institutionalized violence ... and the violation of human rights.'' He urged a dialogue between the country's political forces. Government newspapers and radio have been calling <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> a servant of the rich and contrasting him to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is extolled as a religious man and friend of the poor.

 Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> says <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is leading the way among Latin American nations trying to strengthen their economies and assume a greater role in world trade. He told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Wednesday the administration has high hopes `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will be the first olive out of the jar'' in a succession of Latin economic successes and said the long-range goal _ perhaps in 20 years _ should be a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> with no trade barriers. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said informal talks have already been held with <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> officials about working toward a free trade arrangement similar to what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` They are cautious,'' he said. `` We should not push them too hard, too fast. But they are interested, very interested.'' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Banking international finance and monetary policy subcommittee that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s new political leadership is highly energetic and has taken significant steps to set a new economic course. He said the nation's inflation rate has fallen to an annualized rate of about 13 percent in the past few months and debt relief agreements worked out with world lenders have freed up money for domestic investments that are spurring the economy. He called <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s economic progress the best evidence that the plan Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> outlined for restructuring Third World debt can work. `` I agree the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan will not work by itself, but it's part of the puzzle,'' he said in response to skepticism from several Democratic committee members. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said a willingness by American businesses to put long-term investments into <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a key part of administration's strategy in the region. `` Despite the discouragement of the debt problem,'' he said, `` we are seeing our major competitors making large new investments in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, particularly <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and putting together very competitive packages to capture major projects in sectors where we have traditionally been preeminent.'' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is being particularly aggressive in moving into <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s mining sector and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s aluminum industry. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is pushing hard in telecommunications in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is moving aggressively in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, he said. `` These moves suggest that other industrial countries are taking the long view, looking ahead to a brighter economic situation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government's latest report on poverty shows the gap between rich and poor is widening as the wealthy reap a disproportionate share of the nation's record peacetime expansion, advocates for the poor say. The poverty rate fell from 13.4 percent in 1987 to 13.1 percent last year, and the number of impoverished people declined from 32.3 million to 31.9 million, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. But it said neither change was big enough to be statistically significant. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> of the private Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said the report `` provides disturbing evidence of the unevenness of the -LRB- economic -RRB- recovery.'' `` Its economic benefits are disproportionately going to those at the top of the income spectrum and missing many at the bottom,'' he said. The poorest fifth of the population received 4.6 percent of total national family income in 1988, the lowest percentage since 1954, while the richest fifth received 44 percent, the highest ever recorded, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, however, chose to highlight a 1.7 percent jump in real per capita income last year, to a new high of $ 13,120. Blacks made bigger gains than whites, but still lagged far behind. Income for whites rose 1.5 percent to $ 13,900. Income for blacks increased 3.9 percent to $ 8,270 and the figure for Hispanics was virtually unchanged at $ 7,960. `` It's a year basically in which most groups stayed the same or improved,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Butz </PERSON>, the agency's associate director for demographics. <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said the per capita income figures are averages that were pulled up by big gains for the richest Americans. He said median household income showed no significant gains overall, registering $ 27,230 in 1988, up from $ 27,140 a year earlier after adjusting for the rise in consumer prices. <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>, director of the non-profit Women and Poverty Project, said the census report contained troubling new evidence that women are being left behind. For example, she said, 53 percent of poor families in 1988 were headed by women alone, the highest proportion on record. `` We are once again experiencing the feminization of poverty,'' she said. The annual release of the poverty report once again revived the debate over the accuracy of the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s figures. The conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said Census overstates the extent of poverty and underestimates the financial well-being of millions of Americans. `` The 1988 Census data, though still deficient, thus show steady and significant improvement for most Americans,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Beirne </PERSON>, a visiting fellow at Heritage. Census for the first time this year issued an alternative set of poverty figures based on an experimental price index that it said was more accurate. The alternate numbers _ published in an appendix to the official report _ would cut the poverty rate for 1988 by 1.5 percentage points to 11.6 percent and reduce by 3.6 million the number of people classified as living in poverty. The congressional <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> criticized those alternate figures as inaccurate and issued a report saying if the poverty rate were calculated by what it said were more realistic methods, the figures would be far higher. For example, while the official Census figure for 1987 was 13.5 percent, two better methods of calculation would have put the poverty rate at 16.1 percent or 24.1 percent in 1987, the committee said. `` This study indicates poverty is not declining. Rather, more Americans are poor today than at any time since the 1960s,'' the committee said in a statement.

 New tests show widespread contamination of private homes in eight states with cancer-causing radon gas, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says in urging all homeowners to test for the gas. Radon is `` one of the most serious environmental health problems today,'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Radon can really be found anywhere.'' Radon contamination is said to cause as many as 20,000 lung cancer deaths year, second only to the number caused by smoking. The agency released test results showing that in eight states, about one-fourth of 11,000 randomly tested homes had radon readings considered unhealthy. Nearly three of four homes tested in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> had significant radon readings. The results mirrored findings over the last two years in 17 other states. Overall, said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, about one-fourth of the 37,000 homes tested in 25 states so far have shown unhealthy indoor radon levels. Radon is a colorless and odorless gas that is produced naturally by the decay of uranium in soil and rocks. While levels found outdoors normally pose no health concerns, concentrations of 4 picocuries per liter of air indoors are considered unhealthy. Among the 25 states, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was found to have the most widespread radon problem. Seventy-one percent of the 1,381 homes tested had more than 4 picocuries per liter and 8 percent showed more than 20 picocuries per liter. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> estimated that as many as 10 million homes may have year-round average radon levels that exceed 4 picocuries per liter of air. So far only 2 million homes have been tested for the gas. In an effort to boost radon testing, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and the Advertising Council announced a national public service advertising campaign to warn about the dangers from radon and urge testing of all homes. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Wooden </PERSON>, the council's president, said research conducted in connection with the ad campaign showed that even when people are aware of a potential radon health problem, they are reluctant to test. A survey of 1,000 people showed two-thirds believe radon to be a health concern, but only 14 percent said they plan to do anything about it. `` People believe they are safe in their homes,'' she said. Radon often seeps into a house through cracks and foundation openings. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that correcting the problem is often relatively simple _ perhaps as easy as creating additional venting of the gas to the outside. Test kits cost about $ 20 and corrective action normally costs from $ 200 to $ 1,500, according to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. The latest tests covered <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> as well as three <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> regions: <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Bemidji </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Here are the percentages of homes found with radon levels of more than 4 picocuries per liter: <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, 71 percent; <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, 30 percent; <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 29 percent; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, 23 percent; <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, 16 percent; <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, 8 percent. Results in the Indian Health Service regions: <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION>, 35 percent; <LOCATION> Bemidji </LOCATION>, 20 percent; <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, 17 percent. A year ago, 46 percent of the homes tested in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and 63 percent of those in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> exceeded the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> guideline for healthy air. Ten locations this year showed radon above 100 picocuries per liter of air, which according to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is equivalent to more than 2,000 chest X-rays each year or smoking four packs of cigarettes a day. The highest reading was at a house on the Lower Brule Indian Reservation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, 316 picocuries per liter.

<TEXT>
 Angolan anti-communist rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> says he believes the truce with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s leftist government can be revived within the next two weeks even though a cease-fire attempt four months ago was unsuccessful. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> also said in a telephone interview Wednesday from the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> that a mutual prisoner exchange with the Angolan government is possible. After reaching a high point last June, the Angolan peace process has been bogged down by a resumption of fighting between government and rebel forces as well as disagreements between <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> and Zairean President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON>, the chief peace mediator. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> also angered his principal foreign patron, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, when he declined to attend talks last month designed to reinstate the cease-fire which had been agreed to last June. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> sounded upbeat following his weekend talks in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> and his earlier discussions in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. At one point recently, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> was concerned that <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> had abandoned impartiality and was siding with the Angolan government. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> made no reference Wednesday to a resumption of direct talks with the Angolan government but said he was optimistic a cease-fire could be back on track `` during this month of October.'' He raised the possibility that some African nations might contribute troops to monitor the cease-fire if it is revived. But even if a truce is agreed to, the <ORGANIZATION> MPLA </ORGANIZATION> government and <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> face the challenging task of reaching a political settlement. With <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support, <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> is calling for free and fair elections to be a key ingredient of the peace process. The Angolan government has a much narrower view of national reconciliation, insisting the existing constitution remain unchanged. But <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said recent statements by senior Angolan officials suggest a more flexible attitude on reconciliation. They are `` not so intransigent'' as they were before, said <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, who stopped off in the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> while en route to his home base in rebel-held southeast <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Discussing the possibility of a prisoner exchange, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said there are between 3,000 and 5,000 <ORGANIZATION> MPLA </ORGANIZATION> prisoners in <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> hands. He said the government has refused to disclose the number of rebel prisoners it holds. While the government receives substantial backing from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> has been getting about $ 40 million annually from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> has been at war with the <ORGANIZATION> MPLA </ORGANIZATION> government for 14 years.

<HEAD>Predicting Earthquakes, Scientists Say Where But Not When</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RESTON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Even as residents of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> begin the process of rebuilding, scientists are launching research efforts in hopes of learning something from Tuesday's earthquake to help them warn people the next time. And there will be a next time. Scientists can predict that and say approximately where the tremor will strike. It's when that troubles them. The <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION> area where Tuesday's quake was focused, for example, was singled out as a region where a quake was considered likely. But scientists could n't pin down the time except to say sometime between 1988 and 2018. Like weather forecasters a century ago, geologists today look at what has happened in the past and try to use that information to predict what will come in the future. But while today's weather satellites allow meteorologists a bird's - eye view of the approaching weather, geologists still struggle to analyze events miles below the `` It's difficult to make short-term predictions of earthquakes,'' admitted <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesson </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquakes </ORGANIZATION>, Volcanoes and Engineering at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey. `` I would say there was a successful long-term prediction of this quake,'' he said, pointing out the Survey report issued last year. `` Unfortunately, we did n't have any warning of this earthquake last night,'' said <PERSON> Wesson </PERSON>. `` Really, we do n't know how to make short-term predictions of earthquakes, either little ones or big ones,'' he admitted. Sometimes smaller shocks foreshadow a major quake, and that may have happened in this case too. The region had remained relatively quiet for several years, until a quake estimated at 5.1 on the Richter scale occurred on June 27, 1988, and another rated at 5.2 struck on Aug. 8 of this year. Those events prompted the agency to pay increased attention to the <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION> region and to notify <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> officials, <PERSON> Wesson </PERSON> said. But little could be done beyond that because there was no way to tell if the tremors were foreshocks or just individual quakes on their own. Using historical records of quakes, measurements of ground motion and other analyses, scientists are able to single out places where they believe tremors will strike _ much as they were able to predict that the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helen </LOCATION>'s volcano would erupt _ but not when. Such predictions `` are not useful in evacuating dangerous buildings, but they are useful in land use planning and resource allocation in anticipation of future events,'' said <PERSON> Wesson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Russ </PERSON>, assistant chief geologist at the Survey, explained that quakes occurring along faults in the earth release stress that builds up over time. When this movement releases stress in one area the strain can be increased in other spots. But whether that would induce major quakes in those areas can not be predicted, he said. A strong quake does trigger thousands of smaller aftershocks as the many rocks along the fault line adjust themselves, and there remains the chance of strong aftershocks, he said. <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> said officials are looking for `` any unusual characteristics'' in their studies of the quake, measured by sensitive equipment that calculates the movement of land, changes in the strain on rocks and uplift of the earth, among other things. They hope their findings will help them understand, and thus predict, future quakes.

 Atlantis' astronauts are trying their hands at cinematography, growing corn and photographing lightning as they orbit Earth. The crew completed its main task about six hours after the shuttle soared into orbit Wednesday, dispatching the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> probe riding in its cargo bay on a six-year journey to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>. During their five-day mission the astronauts will be busy completing several new experiments and some that were conducted on earlier shuttles. One experiment will measure sections of the Earth's protective ozone layer with an instrument that calculates the amount of solar irradiance from the sun and how much irradiance is scattered back, never reaching the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. That information will be compared to data taken by nearly identical instruments on three satellites. Researchers want to calibrate data from the satellites with measurements taken on the shuttle, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Braukas </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Goddard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greenbelt </LOCATION>, Md. `` They're curious to see whether or not the readings -LRB- from the satellites -RRB- are true,'' <PERSON> Braukas </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> plans to fly the experiment on several more shuttle flights. Ozone in the stratosphere can block much of the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation. When the ozone layer is intact, it prevents damaging levels of ultraviolet radiation from reaching <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Atlantis' five astronauts also planned to monitor corn seedlings in four special canisters as part of an experiment aimed at determining how gravity affects developing plants. The plants were to be frozen after four days of growth and then studied on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Researchers hope the experiment one day will help them devise ways to grow food in space and improve crops on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Astronauts plan to conduct several more experiments, including: _ Testing the effects of microgravity on three materials _ polyethylene, nylong and a polymer blend _ when they are heated and then cooled _ Placing purified water on two copper plates to see how crystals develop in microgravity and at what temperature they form The experiment is designed to learn more about how ice forms and better determine development of clouds and weather conditions. <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, 25, a physics student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, designed the experiment.

IMAX film taken on three previous flights was used in one film about shuttle missions for the giant-screen theaters around the world. Several medical experiments also were to be conducted, including measuring the natural radiation background of the atmosphere, said <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurston </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Center Calls For Educating Teen-Agers On AIDS Prevention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Center for Population Options says massive public education and prevention programs are imperative to stem the rapid spread of AIDS among teen-agers. The center said schools, churches, community organizations and parents must do a better job correcting misinformation about AIDS, helping teen-agers delay sexual intercourse, ensuring that those who do have sex use condoms and warning teen-agers about the dangers of drug use. `` Our children have a right to straightforward, accurate information about HIV infection and how to prevent it,'' said a report issued Wednesday by the nonprofit educational center. The center is partially funded by the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. The number of AIDS cases among teen-agers jumped by 43 percent to 398 between July 1988 and July 1989, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. But because the time between infection and the onset of AIDS can be as long as 10 years, public health officials believe that many people with AIDS who are now in their 20s may have picked up the virus when they were teen-agers.

 A saboteur ripped insulation laced with cancer-causing asbestos from pipes at <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> government offices and placed it in front of air-circulation fans, police said. The fans were shut off when the asbestos was found, and tests found no dangerous levels in the air at the County Executive Building, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Domash </PERSON> said Wednesday. Airborne asbestos fibers can be inhaled and cause debilitating lung disease and even lung cancer. Inspector <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Nassau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the asbestos insulation also was found in front of a fan at police headquarters but officials did n't test the air because they believed the material was found soon enough to prevent danger. `` This is not an act of vandalism,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` Someone intentionally ripped the asbestos off the pipes and strategically put it in an area which they thought could hurt someone.'' County engineers also found torn insulation in front of fans in a third county building, but that insulation contained no asbestos, authorities said. The three rooms involved are locked and located in secured areas which are not easily accessible without identification cards, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. There was no evidence of a break-in. `` Someone did n't walk off the street and do this,'' he said. `` The individual or individuals had to know what they were doing and had access to the areas.'' Asbestos insulation was found in front of fans Monday and Tuesday at the county police headquarters and an underground emergency operations center behind police headquarters. No problems had been found in the ventilation rooms when they were checked by the same engineer on routine rounds 24 hours earlier, according to White. There are 300 to 400 county employees in the three buildings. `` It could have been anyone: a disgruntled employee, maybe someone who is trying to make a statement,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said.

 Officially, at least, no one was born Wednesday in this city of 740,000 people. No one died. No one was married either. The doors to City Hall, like so many others in this once-vibrant and remarkably resilient metropolis, were barred. `` Have n't had one customer the entire day,'' said police officer <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, the lone sentry posted at the rear entrance to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s grand City Hall. `` No babies, no couples. In fact, no one's asked about any kind of license. `` And anyway,'' he added, `` who'd be in this much of a hurry to get married?''

 Licenses aside, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciscans </LOCATION> went about their business with few differences from their counterparts elsewhere in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, just one day after a catastrophic earthquake wrenched <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s western elbow. And many managed the feat without the amenities everyone else was taking for granted: electricity and running water, telephones and easy access to fast food. Some people, in fact, barely noticed the difference. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Walk </PERSON>, who with wife <PERSON> Flo </PERSON>, fled <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> 2 -LCB- years ago for warmer temperatures and the vague promise of work, pointed toward a roll of blankets under a tree in Civic Cneter Plaza and said, `` That's my home. `` And after what happened,'' he added, `` I'd rather be living out here anyway.'' A bottle of cooking oil and a box of bread-crumb coating mix sat opened on a bench nearby as <PERSON> Flo </PERSON> <PERSON> Walk </PERSON> fried up red snapper on a small metal grate atop a tall steel cylinder. Behind her, the late afternoon sun glistened off City Hall's polished walls. `` A lot of people will be eating like us tonight,'' she said. `` But the funny thing is we had enough money last night for a hotel room. That's where we were when all the shaking started. Can you believe that?''

<TEXT>
 Guerrilla leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> says he is ready to resume negotiations with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government and hopes a new cease-fire can be signed within a month. `` We are ready to talk anywhere,'' he said Wednesday in a telephone interview during a stop in <LOCATION> Abidjan </LOCATION>. `` I think the cease-fire will be signed this month because the mood is good.'' He said his side wants the new truce to include monitors provided by other African countries and release of all prisoners through the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The guerrilla chief, who has <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support, said he was in <LOCATION> Abidjan </LOCATION> to brief President <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Houphouet-Boigny </PERSON> on weekend talks in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> with President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> leads the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> has mediated negotiations toward ending the 14-year-old war in the former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony and was host for four days of talks on the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION> with Angolan, South African and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. He negotiated a cease-fire in the conflict between <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION>, known as the <ORGANIZATION> MPLA </ORGANIZATION>, during a meeting June 22 at his home village of <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION>, but it broke down within days. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> subsequently rejected <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>'s mediation, accusing the Zairean leader of siding with the Angolan government. He refused to attend a meeting of African heads of state last month in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, aimed at reviving the negotiations. At issue were the claim of several African leaders that <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> had agreed to go into exile and the integration of his guerrillas into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s armed forces. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said no such an agreement, which he described as a defeat, had been made at <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has supported <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>'s government despite criticizing his human rights record, was caught between two allies. Some congressional supporters of <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, the main conduit of $ 40 million in annual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, had blocked the flow of weapons. After the <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION> meeting, <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> and Angolan officials went to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met separately with <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> and the guerrilla leader, urging new negotiations. The French <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION> meeting was held a few days later and <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> declared Wednesday it was a success. `` President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> has reassured us that the basis of our work in negotiations will be and will remain the <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION> agreement,'' he said. `` So we are reconciled on that,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said. `` He has been our friend in the past and I think we can consider our relations with him very good, and we have renewed our confidence in him as a mediator.'' <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> has said recent interviews in which Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON> <PERSON> Loy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> should discuss the issues of exile and integration, were encouraging. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said Wednesday: `` When they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MPLA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- say exile has to be discussed, good. I think they are coming along. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> has also said once the cease-fire is signed, the rest of the political problem will be discussed by <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> MPLA </ORGANIZATION>, face to face, because it is an Angolan problem. Others should be called in only if we have problems.''

 The strongest typhoon to strike the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> this year lashed the east coast of <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> today with 127 mph winds after residents of areas in its path were told to seek higher ground. Advance winds from Typhoon <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> struck land at midday near <LOCATION> Casiguran </LOCATION>, 130 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, and the center of the storm was expected to come ashore a few hours later, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. Storm warnings were issued for all of <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>, the main <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> island, and at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations. `` Any typhoon of this strength is capable of massive destruction,'' said forecaster <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Manalo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON>'s westward path would take it across the rugged mountains of northeastern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> and across the north-central agricultural heartland about 100 miles north of the capital. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage, but <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> radio stations said they received sketchy reports of flooding and landslides in the north. <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> DZXL </ORGANIZATION> said its affiliate in <LOCATION> Bayombong </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Nueva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vizcaya </LOCATION> province 130 miles to the north, was knocked off the air by a power failure. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said all six <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military installations on <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> had been placed on maximum typhoon alert. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> forecasters predicted the storm would pass about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> but near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> John Hay Air Station in <LOCATION> Baguio </LOCATION>, 130 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The storm was reported moving about 12 mph and was expected to weaken as it crossed the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madre </LOCATION> mountains of northeastern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> canceled flights from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> to northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> ordered ships to stay in port in the affected area. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials said some jets had been moved to air bases in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> until the storm passed. The Far East Network, which broadcasts to the 40,000-member <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military community, advised residents at <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wallace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> to stock up on fresh water, flashlights, candles and other emergency equipment. Residents at the U.S.-run <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> naval base, 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, were also advised to take precautions. Base spokesman Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukri </PERSON> said there were relatively few warships in port `` so we're not going to have a very big exodus if the conditions worsen.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> routinely sends warships into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> when storms threaten <PERSON> Subic </PERSON>. <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> was the third major storm to strike the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in two weeks.

 Near the crest of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Springwater </PERSON> watched the <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district burn, fearing their young children might be wandering in the stricken area. The emotional trial of the Springwaters was just one of many in the Bay area quake catastrophe. But their story shares a common thread with all families who struggled to find each other across a disrupted urban landscape. `` You could see large plumes of smoke coming from the Marina,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` I tend to look on the bright side but it did n't look good. We knew something catastrophic had happened there.'' Said Jane: `` For our children's babysitter, Tuesday is usually the day they go down to the Marina. And my mom had said earlier in the day they were going ... but I had no idea if my kids were in a car, if they were walking. ... `` Not until we reached <LOCATION> Nob </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> could we see the smoke,'' she said. `` And it looked bad _ it looked like a huge fire.'' Like many working couples, the Springwaters were at their offices, away from their children, when the quake struck Tuesday evening. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>, a 33-year-old attorney, sat at her 39th-floor desk as the shock wave rumbled through. For a moment or two, she said, she thought only of moving away from her window, into the hall. `` And then, all I could think of was, ` Oh my God! my kids. I have no idea where my kids are.''' But she had a clue. On Tuesdays, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>, 4, and <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>, 1 -LCB-, usually went to the Marina with their babysitter. And their grandmother, visiting from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said that that was where they were going to go Tuesday. `` I called my husband as soon as the quake hit. His receptionist picked up the line. I asked for him, and the lines went dead.'' With no link to her family, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> turned to the trickle of news reports on radio and television. They were sketchy. But one thing seemed pretty clear: the <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> was taking a beating. The area was devastated by fire. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, 37, worked in his office five blocks from <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s in the financial district. `` Since I'm an architect, I went into the elevator core,'' he said. The area between elevators is a building's most solid component, he said. `` I do n't really trust buildings. `` I was n't worried about the <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> though,'' he said, recalling his feelings when hearing on the radio that the district was flattened. `` I did n't know the kids were in the Marina.'' The Springwaters had talked a lot about putting together an earthquake contingency plan but they never quite worked out the details. So <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> started walking, moving past dazed, disoriented financial district regulars shuffling along on the sidewalk. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> did n't show up at the front of her building. The elevators were n't operating So he opened the door and started up 39 floors. His wife already was well on her way down the same escape route. `` Had I left 10 minutes earlier, he would have climbed 39 floors to find I was n't there,'' she said. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> shared her fears about their children. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gramma </PERSON> had left the Marina just minutes before the quake, though, to go shopping. In fact, they scarcely knew they were in the middle of the second-deadliest quake in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. When the Springwaters arrived at their <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> neighborhood, two hours after the initial jolt, everything looked perfect. Their century-old house, a survivor of the 1906 catastrophe, stood in place, brick for brick. `` When I got home and opened the door,'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> said, `` everyone was there. They had eaten dinner. And my son was excited that there were no lights.''

Meanwhile, in another development, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had sent word to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that he did not intend to apply for a visa to attend a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> debate next month on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Intermediaries had informed <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> that seeking entry would be `` controversial'' and then word came back that he did not intend to ask for a visa, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration last year denied <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> responded by moving its <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> discussion to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Since then, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has opened talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Fourteen <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials were permitted to attend the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session this fall. Chastising <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> press room podium, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials insisted their overriding goal was to arrange talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION>. That effort is running into roadblocks in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and also within the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which rejects it outright. In a speech delivered Wednesday night to a gathering of fundamentalist Christians in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> again went on the offensive. `` This is our land from the dawn of history, and it will be so always,'' he said. `` We will not be pushed or pressured.'' The prime minister, in a closed meeting Tuesday with legislators from his <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> political coalition, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> might be `` entering a period of tension with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. He also said `` the battle is hard. It's a miracle that thus far we have held our own against the world where no element supports our position.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> again rejected Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s attempt to arrange negotiations between Israelis and <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> prior to holding elections <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the meeting would be a trap to make <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` slide into recognition of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state.'' The prime minister also was quoted as saying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was without friends in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s spokeswoman, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, described that remark as `` ludicrous'' and added: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are good friends and good allies and have been for many, many years, and that's very well known.'' Asked about <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s other remarks, the spokeswoman read this prepared statement: `` We've said all along that all sides should refrain from statements that make it harder to advance the peace process. The statement he made yesterday was unhelpful and we are disappointed. `` We are not looking for a fight or a confrontation with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Everyone knows that. Our only purpose is to help the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to advance its own peace initiative.'' However, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> did not mention <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s criticism of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategy once during a long telephone conversation with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> `` If this was such a burning issue with Secretary <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, it seems to me it would have been the first thing he brought up this morning on the phone,'' <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` I am telling you it did not come up once.'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> also had some criticism for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Monday rejected <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s five-point plan for Israeli-Palestinian talks. <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s political department, was quoted on Tuesday as saying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stance did not reflect a serious move toward a just settlement in the region `` If Palestinians want to participate they must find a way to engage practically in a dialogue with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Statements out of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> ... also were unhelpful,'' the spokeswoman said.

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, a drug-plagued neighborhood of broken glass, shaken buildings and people, marshaled its resources to help the people they knew were trapped under the Nimitz Freeway. After the double-decked Cypress portion of Interstate 880 caved in during Tuesday's earthquake, residents came quickly to the rescue, mobilizing to provide tools, rescue squads and support services. `` I have n't seen that much love in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> in a long time,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, a street vendor. `` It was something to see.'' Police Lt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eade </PERSON> praised the community that tried to help the victims of the freeway disaster. `` They climbed up on the bridge to take people off. They lined up to volunteer. They established medical help as soon as possible,'' <PERSON> Eade </PERSON> said. `` I did n't see one instance of a citizen that did n't cooperate.'' `` West <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> has a bad image as a dope haven, but there was a lot of community effort,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, a car repair shop owner who directed traffic for four hours with flares provided by grateful police. `` This community came through.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON>, a boilermaker, saw the community leap into action as soon as the earthquake struck. `` The neighborhood people all came out to help, so we said, ` Go back into your houses and get ladders, wire cutters, tools, flashlights, whatever you can find, and meet back here in 20 minutes,''' the 52-year-old <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON> said. The group managed to get forklifts and tore down a cyclone fence to position the machinery under the freeway. Others went into a nearby factory to get ladders and lumber, while still others brought small hydraulic jacks they used to lift mangled cars. <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON> estimated they evacuated 40 to 50 people off the highway. Twenty-one were injured and had to be taken off on gurneys. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said the community where former Black Panther leader <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was slain recently has suffered from a bad reputation. `` They've got a lot of good people who are trapped here by their drug problems. In general they are good responsible citizens,'' he said. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, a janitor who lives a few blocks from the freeway, spent all Wednesday at the scene after volunteering. `` After all you here about <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> and its problems, a disaster hits and boom you find out everybody's pulling together,'' he said.

 The soil conditions, land-use patterns and construction quality of an area often have more bearing on the deadliness of an earthquake than the proximity of the quake's epicenter That lesson was demonstrated again during the catastrophic quake that struck the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area Tuesday with a magnitude of 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, geologists and engineers said Wednesday. The <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> freeway that collapsed, killing an estimated 250 people, was 50 miles from the center of the quake. By contrast, some places just a few miles from the epicenter were hardly scathed. Damage was relatively light and casualties were few in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, only 18 miles north of the center. And in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, a scant 10 miles south of the epicenter, only a few deaths were reported despite extensive damage. `` <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> experienced the kind of damage it did because it was in the earthquake epicentral area,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a civil engineering professor at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. `` But there is n't a big Nimitz Freeway running through <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>. The biggest concentration of large structures is around <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.'' Tuesday's quake was the same magnitude as the quake that ravaged Soviet <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> last December. The Armenian quake killed at least 25,000 people _ more than 90 times the number of deaths reported in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area by early today. The major difference in toll is a result of better design and construction in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey officials said. Generally, the intensity of ground shaking is strongest near the epicenter, which explains why many buildings and roads collapsed in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hollister </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> may have escaped catastrophic damage because much of the city sits on stream deposits somewhat firmer than bay mud and fill, said geologist <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Earth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a Palo Alto consulting firm. But the severe damage to the freeway and the <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, near the water's edge, `` seems to mainly be a function of ground conditions: either artificially filled ground or not very stable natural deposits around the margins of the bay,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. The Nimitz Freeway _ built in 1957, a more primitive period of earthquake design _ apparently rests on soft fill and bay mud, which produces more of a rolling effect that goes on longer than bedrock, which shakes at high frequencies _ short, sharp jolts, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. The catastrophic earthquakes centered on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast in 1985 caused the worst damage and most of the 4,000-plus deaths in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which rests on soft sediments of an old lakebed 250 miles from the epicenter. The change in seismic waves as they spread from a fault, along with softer soils, give the waves longer vibration periods, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. That can make them more damaging to large structures _ such as the <LOCATION> Nimitz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Freeway </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, which had a 50-foot section collapse _ than to small ones.

 An animal trainer who fled the state with two elephants in 1984 said he will return to face charges following his arrest in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON>, 59, repossessed the elephants after a dispute with two men who bought them from him. <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> claimed the buyers mistreated the animals and fell behind on their payments. `` I do n't think I'm crazy,'' <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> said Wednesday in an interview from jail in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, broadcast on television station <ORGANIZATION> WWOR </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>. `` It's a very serious thing.'' <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> was arrested Tuesday on a fugitive warrant after one of the men, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, tracked him down. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> has said he has spent thousands of dollars searching for Seidon around the country. <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> WWOR </ORGANIZATION> he would not fight extradition back to <LOCATION> Monmouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where he faces charges of third-degree theft. If convicted he would face up to five years in prison and a $ 100,000 fine. <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> sold the Indian elephants, <PERSON> Tory </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duchess </PERSON>, to <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, in 1981 for $ 80,000 The Drakes owned a now-closed exotic-animal ranch in <LOCATION> Tehachapi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. While the animals were on tour in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> in 1984, <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> had a dispute with the Drakes and seized the elephants. <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> said he decided to take the elephants back when the Drakes fell behind in their payments. He also said that while waiting for money from the Drakes at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> farm, he discovered the animals had wounds from hooks used during training. The Drakes denied abusing the animals. A <LOCATION> Monmouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> judge in May 1984 ordered <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> to return the 7-foot-tall elephants. Instead, <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> fled with them in a truck and has hid them ever since. He pursued an appeal through telephone contacts with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, an animal-rights activist. But the state appeals court rebuffed <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> in January, saying he failed to show the animals had been abused and provided no reason to believe the court had erred in 1984. <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> has said he raised the animals, now in their late 20s, from their infancy. He told a newspaper in 1988 that he left his <LOCATION> Fordland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, farm and his career preparing animals for circus and television appearances to care for the elephants, which eat about 200 pounds of hay a day. He also said he had n't seen his four children or met his only grandson since he took off with the animals. The elephants are in a barn in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Thousands Storm Statehouse to Protest Education Cuts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some 15,000 people protested higher education budget cuts in a demonstration that grew unruly when several hundred students tried to enter the Statehouse and blocked an entrance. Many students wore dunce caps that read `` State Skool,'' and chanted `` No More Cuts!'' Many urged legislators to support new taxes to pay for education. Capitol Police Capt. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said four were arrested: two for assault and battery and two others for disorderly conduct. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said a window was broken and a drainpipe knocked down, and officials estimated repairs could total $ 20,000. The higher education system, already strapped by earlier cuts, faces an additional $ 25 million in trimming during the next round of budget reductions. State Police Cpl. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Howley </PERSON> estimated the number of demonstrators to be 15,000. One person was removed from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> when he repeatedly yelled down from the visitors' gallery to ask House Speaker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Keverian </PERSON> if he intended to discuss the cuts. The Statehouse lawn's flower beds were trampled and more than 100 state, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> police closed the front entrances and patrolled the halls. From his chair, <PERSON> Keverian </PERSON> asked members to remain in the chamber, called in police reinforcements and addressed a large gathering of students outside. `` Everything that is being done here is not helpful and is in fact disgraceful,'' he said. `` Trampling down doors, breaking the law and breaking windows is not what we expect from our young people and will not be helpful to you.'' Higher Education Chancellor <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenifer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsongas </PERSON>, Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' education aide <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, and others came to counsel the students to remain orderly. Students swarmed over the Capitol steps, carrying signs that read `` Stop Killing My College,'' and `` We want <PERSON> Mikey </PERSON>.'' One simply read `` Arrrgh!'' Other students paraded with a coffin. The protesters began to disperse after they were informed their buses were leaving, but one man made a dash for the House lobby door. State police arrested him and pushed through the crowd to take him away. About 200 students had gathered in front of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' office earlier in the day and <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> spoke to the group. `` The fact of the matter is that we, with you, believe no more cuts is exactly the right thing,'' <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> told them. The students were divided on whether to believe the administration, and some loudly jeered <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>. `` No more lies!'' one young man yelled. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> pressed on, telling the students they had to convince legislators and voters that new taxes were needed to pay for higher education and other state programs. `` This can not be a one-day rally,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who was out of the building throughout the afternoon, said he was pleased by the students' show of solidarity, but not by the rowdy behavior.

 In the midst of disaster, some companies have stepped forward to offer free services to those in need, from legal advice to fresh pasta. Lawyer <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Belli </PERSON> and his staff set up tables Wednesday afternoon in front of his downtown offices, offering free legal counsel to the public, said <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, an employee at <PERSON> Belli </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> office <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Belli </PERSON> and his attorneys were not working out of their office because the building was apparently unsafe. <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the world's biggest engineering companies, loaned the city of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> the services of its civil and structural engineers, said spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` This is our hometown and we'd like to help in whatever way we can, and we thought this was the best way,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. He said similar assistance was also offered to <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> and the state. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> started trying to contact its estimated 200 engineers in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area beginning Tuesday night. As of Wednesday, 25 to 30 were helping the city inspect buildings. He said more engineers would be offered to the municipalities as they report in to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> headquarters. The Bechtel office was otherwise closed Wednesday. `` We have got a total of 1,500 projects going on in the world ... so the expertise here is pretty deep,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` It's a valuable commodity to have, and we are just happy to loan it to the city.'' Cellular One of <LOCATION> Burlingame </LOCATION> offered to lend free cellular phones to any emergency service agencies that need them, according to spokeswoman <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>. The company, which also has an office in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, has asked individual customers to refrain from using the network to give better access to relief workers. She said the company has more than 400 channels, with a capacity to handle about 200,000 cellular phones. `` We've had over 500 phones go out our door, to emergency agencies all over the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area,'' said <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>. `` We're doing everything we can. We have people manning our system 24 hours a day.'' The Golden Gate Bridge on Wednesday did not charge a toll for commuters from 6 a.m. to noon, in an effort `` to help alleviate the flow of traffic, the traffic crunch that never happened,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>, spokesman for the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway Transportation District. The district anticipates much more traffic today because of the closed <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. People left hungry got some help from the Aunti Pasta retail store chain. Every person who entered one of the eight Aunti Pasta stores in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> was offered one-third pound of fresh pasta. `` We really want to help people out,'' said <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, manager of one store where at least 30 people in two hours had come in to get pasta. `` I think we all want to help out in whatever way we can,'' said <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>. `` It's our little effort.''

Some of the lawsuits accuse the company of `` conscious indifference for the rights and well-being of the public.'' A lawyer designated as spokesman for lawyers representing <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> was not in his office Wednesday and did not return a phone call by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Families for at least 15 of the 21 dead students are represented in the lawsuits. Other claims were filed on behalf of survivors, and at least five were filed on behalf of students who said they suffered mental anguish after arriving at the scene and seeing their friends and relatives drowning. One suit states that `` <PERSON> Normalinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> was at the scene of the accident in question and observed the bus under the water in the pit as her daughter, <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, still trapped in the bus, drowned.'' Most of the cases are consolidated in 275th District Court in <LOCATION> Edinburg </LOCATION>; others have been filed in three of the other state district courts in <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Alton </PERSON>, 15 miles from the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> border, is located. One survivor's family accused a lawyer of trying to bribe them with $ 700 to keep him on their case. The family of 12-year-old <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Manriquez </PERSON>, which hired <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> on Oct. 4 but chose to hire another lawyer Oct. 9, last week filed for a temporary restraining order to prevent <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> from contacting them. <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> said Wednesday the $ 700 was a loan the <PERSON> Manriquez </PERSON> family had asked him to provide, and he speculated they were unhappy because he did so a day late. `` If that's what they are calling a bribe, well you know I hope my side gets heard,'' <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> said. `` It's a lot more sensational to say an attorney offered a bribe to pursue a fat case than to say he honored a commitment on an advance.'' No ruling has been issued on the restraining order.

<HEAD>Insurer of Oil Spilled in R.I. Sues Ship Owner</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The owners of the tanker that spilled hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> this summer were sued for $ 500,000 by the company that insured the ship's cargo. The lawsuit <ORGANIZATION> Americas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> filed Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Ballard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> asks that the tanker World Prodigy be sold to pay its claim. However, attorneys for both sides said <ORGANIZATION> Ballard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> has promised to pay any claims, making seizure of the vessel unnecessary. The World Prodigy hit a reef a mile south of <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> on June 23, tearing two gashes in its hull. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> estimated 289,000 gallons of heating oil were spilled. The lawsuit alleges that the tanker was unseaworthy, its officers and crew were `` incompetent or unqualified'' and the ship was improperly and inadequately crewed, equipped and prepared for sea. <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Insurance </LOCATION> estimated it will have to pay $ 500,000 in claims for oil that was not delivered or was delivered mixed with seawater. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said he had not seen the lawsuit. He said he was puzzled the insurer would sue before trying to settle its claim out of court. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> had promised to pay any claims against the ship in order to allow the vessel to leave the country, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. The ship went abroad for permanent repairs. In addition to <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, the lawsuit names <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agencies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as a defendant. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rible </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney representing Americas Insurance, said he believed that company was <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>'s agent for operating the ship. After the accident, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> and ship's captain <PERSON> Iakovos </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON> pleaded guilty to violating the federal Clean Water Act, and <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON> pleaded no contest to a state pollution charge. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> paid a $ 500,000 fine. <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON> was fined $ 30,500. A group of fishermen have sued <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> and Georgudis for $ 40 million in damages.

 Dozens of residents were stranded in remote hollows as floods from the remnants of Hurricane <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> wiped out bridges and roads in eastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, and officials feared more rain could trigger flash floods. But in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> on Wednesday, the high waters eased hostility at least momentarily in the bitter <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> coal strike: Strikers rescued three non-union coal company workers whose van slid into a flooding creek. `` We really hate these guys, but we could n't let them die,'' striking miner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Justice </PERSON> said Wednesday. Up to an inch of rain was expected in southeastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> early today, renewing a flash-flood watch, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, a half-inch fell Wednesday night, causing flooding warnings for <PERSON> Mingo </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> counties. The weather service issued flash-flood watches today for 12 southern and eastern counties. In both states, state disaster assessment teams toured flooded areas on Wednesday and found hundreds of residents with homes damaged by the flood, and many without safe drinking water. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> visited hard-hit areas by car after foul weather grounded his helicopter. In <PERSON> Davin </PERSON>, the governor found a man with mud in his home, garage and furnace. `` I had been up deer hunting in <LOCATION> Roane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and my wife called and said the water was coming up,'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Belcher </PERSON> told him. In eastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, several hundred homes were flooded, numerous bridges were washed out and 1,000 families without drinking water, said <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, the county's disaster and emergency services coordinator Drinking water was to be distributed today. <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was one of seven counties that declared emergencies and requested state aid after Tuesday's flood. Eighty percent of the roads and bridges in <LOCATION> Letcher </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> were damaged by the flood, said county Judge-Executive <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON>, who estimated the repair cost at $ 1.5 million. `` We've still got quite a few places where people ca n't get to their homes and ca n't get out,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON>, the judge's son. Water damaged the homes of 200 people in <LOCATION> Clay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and drinking water was being brought to residents in the <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> area, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a county disaster service coordinator. `` We spent the entire day yesterday trying to rescue people,'' he said. <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON>, <PERSON> Letcher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Knott </PERSON> counties requested state emergency assistance. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> was awaiting reports from state disaster survey crews before formally requesting federal assistance. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> signed an executive order Tuesday to declare a state of emergency. In the rescue by the striking miners, witnesses said about eight <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> men jumped out of their cars to help the three non-union workers, who were stuck in rising waters of <LOCATION> Rum </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Dehue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. One of the workers, <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, was trapped with his foot pinned in the van, said state police Trooper <PERSON> Ric </PERSON> The UMW men held <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s head above the rising water while waiting for emergency workers to arrive, said state police Sgt. G.A. <PERSON> Ables </PERSON>. `` Without a doubt, had they not helped, he'd have died,'' <PERSON> Ables </PERSON> said. Justice, one of the rescuers, is a <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> employee who has been on strike since April. `` We do n't want to see anyone killed over this,'' he said. `` We just do n't want anybody taking our jobs.'' The three workers were treated at a hospital for cuts and bruises and released.

 Two <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> security guards pleaded guilty to stealing F-16 jet engines and selling them to undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents. Prosecutors said the airmen at <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> agreed to sell <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> F100-PW-200 engines to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents posing as operators of a mock military surplus store. The arrests were part of Operation Punchout, a three-year undercover investigation that eventually should result in charges against more than 100 people, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>. The `` sting'' involving the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, was based out of a mock military surplus store in the town of <LOCATION> Roy </LOCATION>, 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Airman 1st Class <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Chesterland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty Wednesday to five of 22 counts alleging theft of the three engines and other military equipment from the northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> base. Senior Airman <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty to one count of stealing the engines. The two, who authorities said began selling the stolen goods in 1987, were arrested July 10. Under the plea arrangement, another count charging <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON> with the theft of $ 64,000 worth of computers and the remaining 17 charges against <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> are to be dropped when the pair are sentenced Dec. 12. <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>, 22, also is charged with stealing the engines but Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubeck </PERSON> said the charge likely would be dropped. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said the men's sentences would depend in part on the value of the engines, a matter that would be settled at an evidentiary hearing. The penalty for each of the theft counts is up to 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. Two sergeants have been acquitted of theft charges in courts-martial, four other enlisted men are awaiting trial and prosecutors are deciding whether another man will be tried, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. Late last month, in another part of Operation Punchout, one <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> man and three Californians were arrested on charges of conspiracy, interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle and aiding and abetting.

 Attackers early today bombed the neighboring houses of <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> and another prominent leftist political leader, wounding two people. <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, a top leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convergence </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Aronette </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, vice-president of the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> spoke with journalists outside their heavily damaged homes shortly after the 1:15 a.m. attack. Mrs. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> blamed the army for the attacks. <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> said his two bodyguards were wounded by the explosion of a powerful bomb at his front door. Both were taken to the hospital, though neither man appeared critically hurt, he said. <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in late 1987 after nearly eight years of exile following the death squad slaying of his brother, <PERSON> Mario </PERSON>. He is also a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which is allied with leftist rebels waging a 10-year-old war against a succession of U.S.-backed governments. <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, his wife and their five children were uninjured, though shaken up, by the blast. The roof over the front rooms of the house was destroyed, as were doors, drop ceilings and walls in four rooms. Two cars parked in a carport in front of the house were destroyed. Mrs. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, the widow of <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, lives next door to <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> with her two sons. Three grenades exploded on her roof and right in front of her house moments before the bomb went off at her brother-in-law's door. Damage to the front rooms of her home was also extensive. <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, 47, said the attack `` is intended to impede a political solution to the war.'' But he refrained from directly blaming a particular sector. Representatives of the government and the rebels on Wednesday wound up three days of peace talks in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. The talks produced no substantive accord, but the two sides agreed to meet again next month. `` This is the work of people in the army who do n't want dialogue and negotiation,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, 43. `` They want to start another spiral of violence like in 1980, when they killed my husband. Do they want to bring more mourning to my home?'' The government has urged the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the rebel army, to stop fighting and join the political process. `` Imagine, if this was done to us, who are not the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, what awaits the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> if they convert themselves into a political party,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>. `` There are no guarantees for freedom of poltical activity.'' The bombing came two days after gunmen killed the 23-year - old daughter of an army colonel The government and armed forces blamed the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, which denied any responsibility in the slaying.

<HEAD>Generator Failures Force Jet Landing at Small Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTE VISTA, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Both electrical generators failed on a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-9, forcing it to land at a small airport, an investigator said. The darkened jet skidded about 1,000 feet off the runway and into a muddy field. None of the 104 people aboard was seriously hurt in the emergency landing at unattended <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Municipal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in the mountains of southern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> early Wednesday. The cabin filled with smoke after the landing, and a crew member had to use an ax to hack open a window and relieve cabin pressure so the doors could open, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> said. The pilot suffered minor cuts and bruises and one of the 99 passengers was treated at a hospital for shock and minor injuries, officials said. Flight 109 had been flying from <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. After landing, the pilot used a pay telephone to summon help. The jet's left generator apparently failed in flight late Tuesday and the pilot tried unsuccessfully to start the auxiliary power unit, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s regional director in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The right generator failed soon afterward, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, and the plane was left with battery backup power, which would have lasted only 25 minutes. Passengers said there was no panic, even though the captain could not talk with them over the intercom. `` We did n't have any warnings,'' said passenger <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Borgmann </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Waseca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> `` All we were told is fasten our seatbelts and put our trays in an upright position.'' `` I just kept thinking, ` What's next? Is this thing going to catch fire?''' said <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevilla </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, who held her month-old daughter. `` Then we hit the ground and I just hugged my daughter closer and thought, ` Here we go.''' Passenger <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Thatcher </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, said: `` When the tires blew, the rims just sort of dug into the pavement and slowed us down. I was afraid that we were going to start cartwheeling, but the runway was apparently soft enough that the wheels just dug in.'' The runway at <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION> is 6,000 feet long, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` Under ideal conditions that would be acceptable, but in an emergency situation, it's marginal,'' the investigator said. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sciola </PERSON>, a 49-year-old passenger from <LOCATION> Edina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, said that after the plane landed, `` The pressure was just awful. The little baby next to me was just screaming.'' After the crew managed to open the door, the pilot found a pay telephone to summon help. `` There we were in the middle of a field,'' Sciola said. `` We wandered around these buildings and there was a pay phone. The pilot called and said, ` Excuse me, we've landed out here in this field and we're going to need some emergency vehicles.''' Northwest spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> would not release the pilot's name, saying company policy prohibits releasing crew names unless there is a fatality `` Compliment that captain,'' <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> said. Aside from the broken cabin window, the only apparent damage to the plane was flat tires, said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. Airline officials said they did not immediately know the cause of the generator malfunction.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Legalize Opposition Parties In Further Move Toward Democracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parliament today legalized opposition parties and banned political organizing in the workplace _ a further move toward making a Western-style democracy of a country under <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule for 41 years. Legislators voted to banish parties from the shop and factory floor despite opposition from the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. At a congress last week that dissolved the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and replaced it with the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that embraced democracy, delegates overwhelmingly approved a motion calling for the right to organize party cells in the workplace. Under authoritarian Communist rule, such organizing has allowed the ruling party to maintain political control over industry. It was thus vigorously opposed by newly created opposition groups that are preparing for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s first free national elections since the Communists consolidated power in 1948. The law passed today also seeks to define what the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> owns by drawing the line between legally acquired funds and property and other assets its Marxist-Leninist predecessor merely control or may have seized illegally. The political opposition claims much of the party's wealth was seized illegally after 1948. Under Communist rule, the party had controlled the government. At least in theory, the new law opens the way for people who contend the government stole their property to seek its return. The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which claims to embrace democratic ideals but remains in power at least until the national elections, agreed Wednesday to discuss the disposal of some of its wealth with <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and the government. Constitutional amendments laying down the right of political parties `` to be freely established and ... -LRB- to -RRB- freely function'' were approved Wednesday. But the party law passed during a nationally televised session today is more specific, formally outlining those rights as the country prepares for next year's multiparty elections. Legislators approved some sections of the party law separately, with 279 voting for a ban on parties at the workplace, 44 against, and 12 abstaining. The section specifying <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> assets was approved by 259 parliamentarians, with 44 against and 27 abstentions. Some present did not vote, accounting for the different totals. The bill is specifically geared to political parties wishing to field candidates in the upcoming elections. It specifies, for example, that no party may accept contributions from a foreign state. Among other legislation enacted today was a law creating a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> established the office of president of the republic, who will replace the 21-man collective presidency. But the parliament sidestepped a controversy over when and how the president would be elected. The current arrangement calls for the president to be chosen in a direct election for which Nov. 26 is the tentative date. Opposition forces are calling for a delay until after the parliamentary elections that are to be held by June, and want the new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, where the opposition hopes for an overall majority, to choose the president. The opposition fears the ruling party would be at an advantage if the elections are held next month, that it will not have enough time to organize an effective campaign. Parliament has not acted on a petition calling for a referendum on when to hold the election.

The first post-walkout talks between <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and representatives of 58,700 workers in the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union fizzled Wednesday just four hours after they began. Through a federal mediator, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> negotiators told the union they would not expand the economic package union members rejected Oct. 3, but were willing `` to make adjustments within the framework of the original wage offer,'' the company said in a statement. `` They might be willing to move the numbers around a little bit, but that's not what it's all about,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 751 </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's about improvement.'' Any further talks will be scheduled by federal mediator <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>. He said he will maintain contact with both sides daily, but he held out little hope for an immediate resolution. `` If the parties continue to agree to disagree there's nothing I can do about it,'' <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said. The talks were the first since Oct. 2, two days before <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> members struck to press for a bigger share of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s record profits. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> chief negotiator <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McKean </PERSON> on Wednesday defended the company's wage offer as fair, equitable and the best three-year offer in recent American industry history. The Machinists voted 85 percent to strike rather than take a contract with annual wage increases of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent; bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first year and 3 percent the second; cost-of-living boosts virtually matching inflation; a cut in mandatory overtime to 160 hours a quarter from 200 hours; and higher benefits. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s unwillingness to budge did n't surprise the strikers and he viewed the brief meeting as just a start. `` We'll take it a day at a time,'' he said, adding he planned to join the picket line today. `` That's where the fight will be won, on the picket line.'' Rather than rush to a settlement, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> added, union negotiators planned to move cautiously to avoid a second rejection vote that could leave both sides more entrenched. The Machinists represent 43,300 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers in the Puget Sound area, 12,000 in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, 1,700 in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and a few hundred others at scattered sites in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and other states. For <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, there have been growing reports of concern about delayed aircraft deliveries to <ORGANIZATION> Malaysia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has delivered seven planes during the strike. An agreement would set a pattern for other labor negotiations at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest commercial airplane builder, and traditionally sets the standard for the nation's aerospace industry.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he will visit <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Friday to get a first-hand look at earthquake damage and `` to provide encouragement'' to victims. `` We will stay on top of it,'' the president vowed. He announced his travel plans at a picture-taking session in the Oval Office as he met with Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, just back from their own inspection tour of the stricken <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. White House aides said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would spend about three hours in the bay area. The visit will include a helicopter survey of the affected areas and the president will also meet with local officials, said presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The president cited an `` all-out federal effort'' in responding to the earthquake. `` Our hearts go out to the victims of this disaster and I will be going out there tomorrow to take a look and to provide encouragement to people,'' the president said. He voiced special praise for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and other volunteer efforts, saying: `` Thank God for the volunteers.'' He said volunteers helping in the earthquake effort exemplified what he meant in various speeches by `` a thousand points of light.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> thanked <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> for visiting the stricken area. The president also said he had spoken by phone Wednesday night with <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, who the president said expressed satisfaction with federal efforts. He praised volunteer organizations for responding with `` this concern for their neighbors that just exemplifies the volunteer concept.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the visit by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> `` did signal very much of a concern on the part of the federal government.'' `` We will stay on top of it. We will be in touch with the state officials who in turn are dealing with the local officials there ... We're doing what we should do,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said that `` there was a preparation here that was very, very sound,'' noting earthquake simulation exercises conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ageny </ORGANIZATION> last August. Asked by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in front of reporters and cameras to give his own evaluation of the situation, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said: `` I think volunteerism and preparation are the two important lessons.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that, as far as he could determine, there were no outstanding requests from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state or local officials that were n't currently being met by the federal governmemnt. As he met with the officials, the president held in his lap several <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area newsapers, topped by a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mercury </LOCATION> with the huge headline: `` MASSIVE QUAKE.'' The president, whose administration came under criticism from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and local officials for not responding faster when Hurricane Hugo devastated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> last month, has been making forceful promises over the past two days of federal aid to earthquake victims. On Wednesdsay, he declared his administration will `` take every step and make every effort'' to aid the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area.

Workers dug into a 1 \ - mile-long slab of collapsed freeway in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> with fading hopes that anyone might Authorities fear more than 270 people were killed, most in the highway cave-in. There were signs of life slowly returning to normal. Power was restored in the city's Financial District early this morning, setting off thousands of alarms. Airports were open, and ferries from <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> steamed north to bolster the overburdened <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area commuter fleet. The third game of the World Series, which was within minutes of the opening pitch when the quake struck, was rescheduled for Tuesday at Candlestick Park in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Still, many offices remained closed. The <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, the lifeline that links <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, was expected to be closed at least one or two more weeks while a collapsed section is repaired. An aftershock that measured 5.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion struck at 3:15 a.m. and was centered near <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, 10 miles south of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, according to the state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was real strong,'' said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, an admitting clerk at <ORGANIZATION> AMI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>. `` I ran to the doorway. Most people were just standing there frozen.'' `` No one is really sleeping around here,'' <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> resident <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. Two other aftershocks measured 4.5. The aftershocks collapsed the damaged steeple of a <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> church, and further damaged buildings in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, near the epicenter of Tuesday's 6.9 quake, state officials said. As of early today, more than 1,400 aftershocks were recorded. The strongest, 5.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, struck within 40 minutes of initial jolt, according the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> subway system, reopened and then closed again when a train operator reported a leak in the tube beneath the bay. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> demanded an investigation into the collapse of <LOCATION> Interstate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> 880 </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, saying it should have been built to withstand the devastating force of Tuesday's earthquake. The collapse `` raises troubling questions for the entire state in terms of the construction of our freeways,'' <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. Largely because of the collapse of I-880, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Nimitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freeway </ORGANIZATION>, the quake was the second-deadliest in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. It killed an estimated 270 people _ 250 of them in the rubble of the Nimitz _ and crippled transportation, electric power and commerce in the nation's fourth-largest metropolitan area, a region of more than 6 million people. Besides the commuters crushed in the freeway collapse, at least 21 people died in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> counties. State officials said 1,400 people were injured throughout the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, although hospitals said they treated 2,750 people, many for chest pains. In <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, closest to the quake's epicenter, police arrested at least five people Wednesday night after distraught friends of a woman missing in the rubble marched to protest authorities' decision to stop searching for her Several buildings in the city's historic downtown district were destroyed <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said the quake caused $ 2 billion worth of destruction in his city alone. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, sharply criticized in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> for his response to Hurricane Hugo, quickly declared the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> region a disaster area and directed an initial $ 273 million in relief efforts. White House officials said he would tour the area Friday. More relief began to flow in from places as far afield as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> offered to send disaster teams experienced in finding victims trapped beneath wreckage. Officials in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, dispatched a device used to locate survivors of last year's earthquake in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Hope was fading, however, that anyone would be found alive beneath the devastation in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district or under the crushing weight of I-880. In the affluent <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district, two bodies were spotted in the rubble of a four-story apartment building. Their hands were clutched in an embrace, said Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> of the city <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` There were no signs of life,'' he said. `` It's very unlikely anyone else will be found alive.'' Across <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, crews searched round the clock for victims amid the tons of steel and concrete that had been the Nimitz Freeway. `` We have located several individuals, none of whom are alive so there are no survivors at this point,'' <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> police Capt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. Earlier, rescuers freed a 6-year-old from a car by cutting through the body of his dead mother. The boy was in critical condition. Seven bodies were recovered from the Nimitz and police said at least 86 people were officially reported missing. The quake hit at rush hour, and state officials estimated there were 250 cars caught in the collapse, based on an optimistic assumption of one person per car. A remote-control backhoe was flown in by helicopter to dig out the rubble, but could n't begin operation until workers shored up the 1 \ - mile stretch of Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., got an overhead view of the crushed freeway from a helicopter and offered a horrific description: `` It looked like a snake hacked with an ax It was in bits and pieces.'' The Nimitz, built in the 1950s, was reinforced in 1977 in the first of a three-phase program to earthquake-proof state highways. The second phase, begun on other roads in the last year, had been delayed at the Nimitz pending an engineering study, according to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, the chief engineer for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. Still, <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said he was shocked by the collapse. `` We thought it would withstand the maximum credible earthquake we could have in this area,'' he said. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said the cave-in appeared to be the result of substandard construction. `` I think ... we should have a full inquiry to determine why there were failures,'' <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said.

 The federal government is spending 40 percent less on reducing earthquake hazards than it spent a decade ago even though scientists predict more major temblors, not only in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> but in the South and Northeast. `` We've had essentially no funding for several years,'' Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Walgren </PERSON>, D-Pa., said Wednesday `` It's hard for the public and government to be serious about something that may or may not happen next year.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year to cut $ 3.1 million _ or about 5 percent _ from the earthquake research and emergency preparedness programs of four key agencies. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey experts told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee n science, research and technology that Tuesday's quake in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> region raises their concerns another one of similar size will occur closer to the city _ but not in the near future. `` We're talking about decades rather than days or weeks,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION>. `` It might be slightly more likely we could have an earthquake along the fault but in an area to the north.'' But <PERSON> Wesson </PERSON> said he doubts the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area faces an earthquake that would rival the 1906 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> quake, which experts calculated at an 8.3 magnitude on the later-developed <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. `` I do n't think we expect a magnitude 8 earthquake in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area,'' he said. Tuesday's quake registered a 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, close to the power of last December's earthquake in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> had warned the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee in June to expect an earthquake of least 6.5 magnitude in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area in the next 30 years. Other officials have said areas alog active faults in the East also may face a quake greater than 7 magnitude in the next 20 years. They said <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, are possible sites. Meanwhile, a draft presidential executive order prepared by an interagency task force to improve the safety of federal buildings in quake-prone areas has languished in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s budget office since 1986. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., blames inertia in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administrations for a failure to earthquake response capabilities even though the technology is readily available `` It's partly the case of not thinking about fixing the roof until it's raining, and then not fixing it because it is raining,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1977 established the National Earthquake Reductions Hazard Program to coordinate research into quakes and improve preparedness. But annual federal spending on the effort has dropped from $ 94.4 million to less than $ 66 million in fiscal 1989. This year, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cut the program to $ 62.9 million. As a result, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, regional seismic networks covering the central and eastern states have been cut back sharply along with programs to develop safer buildings, roads and highways. Supporters of the program also say the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has been languid in carrying out its designated lead role for implementing the 1977 law. The agency coordinates its quake-related activities with the Geological Survey, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. A committee of outside experts appointed by <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> concluded in 1987 that <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>'s performance was `` unacceptable.'' It recommended switching the leadership role to the <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> but also called for tripling _ to $ 199 million annually _ what the government spends on earthquake preparedness. That panel said much of its recommended increase should go toward developing supercomputers that might enable scientists to better predict when and where earthquakes will occur and enhance emergency response capabilities.

 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s foreign minister met with President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> today to work out a plan for the withdrawal of Syrian troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as part of a settlement of that nation's civil war. In Taif, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, sources at the meeting of the Lebanese parliament said the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> government also was trying to satisfy Christian demands for withdrawing <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops withdraw from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, an aide to <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> today urged <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers to leave the conference if there is no agreement by Friday. `` We demand clear guarantees that the Syrians would withdraw,'' said <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Abillama </PERSON>, secretary general of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and one of the general's closest advisers. <PERSON> Abillama </PERSON>, after a meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leader, told reporters that <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> parliamentary deputies have agreed to political reform that would shift some power to the Moslems. `` So let them give us something in return,'' he said. The Christian deputies `` should return in 24 hours if they fail to reach agreement,'' he said at midday. Arab diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister Prince <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> arrived unexpectedly in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> late Wednesday carrying a letter from King Fahd on the issue. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Jibrane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kourieh </PERSON> said Syrian Vice President <PERSON> Abdul-Halim </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaddam </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sharaa </PERSON> also attended the meeting. <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> was expected to meet with Lebanese Christians in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> later today to discuss results of the trip. The Lebanese parliament has been meeting in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> for the past 20 days to try to settle that nation's 14-year-old civil war. Talks have been at a standstill for days over the Christians' call for guarantees that the Syrians will withdraw The Syrians have been in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since 1976 under an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate and have become the main power brokers in the country. The Christians, led by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, charge that <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> violated its mandate by siding with the Moslems and have declared a `` war of liberation'' against the Syrians. Conference sources said <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> has advised the Christians that the guarantees they seek would be contained in amendments to a peace accord. They also said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s agreement to the proposed amendments would cool opposition from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Moslem lawmakers and allow the Taif conference to move ahead to discussion of a new power-sharing agreement. The 33 Christian and 30 Moslem lawmakers have agreed to political reforms that would give some of the power of the traditionally dominant Christians to Moslems. But <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has insisted that without guarantees of a Syrian pullout a peace settlement can not be completed. Any peace accord worked out in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> must be approved by the militia commanders in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. An Arab League mediating committee of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> has proposed a two-year phased withdrawal of the Syrians from the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> area. The troops would be redeployed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s eastern <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> until a strong central government were established and the nation signed a security pact with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, however, has insisted that Syrian troops begin leaving <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as soon a charter for national reconciliation is ratified by a parliamentiary session in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

 Authorities searching for missing transients have continued digging at a farm where they found the bodies of three unidentified men buried in a barn. Members of a police task force formed last week used a backhoe Wednesday around a well between a farmhouse and the barn where the bodies were found Monday in shallow graves. Investigators searched two other sites in the <LOCATION> Livingston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, northeast of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, but would not say exactly where. Sheriff's deputies began digging last week at the 40-acre farm of <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> and <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> after arresting the couple Oct. 9 and charging them with conspiracy to steal in an alleged cattle swindle. The bodies were found on another farm about 12 miles south of the Copeland home. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, owner of the farm, said the 75-year-old <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> had worked for him doing odd jobs for 20 years. A man who said he rented the farm until about a week ago, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovey </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> warned him and his four children to stay out of the barn. Asked if he noticed anything, <PERSON> Hovey </PERSON> said: `` Just the stench. It stunk in the barn. I thought an animal had crawled in there and died.'' Authorities declined to say if the Copelands were murder suspects. No charges have been filed except the conspiracy to steal charge, but the squad has said that the search was for several missing transients who have worked for them. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> is not a suspect, authorities said. The charge against the <ORGANIZATION> Copelands </ORGANIZATION> alleges they bought cattle with a check that bounced, then sold the cattle without making good on the check. <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> and his 68-year-old wife remained in jail on bonds of $ 25,000 each.

 An appeals court today refused to release a Palestinian wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the fatal 1982 bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The three-member council that rules on requests for the temporary release of people held in pretrial custody said that it had no jurisdiction over the matter because <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>'s extradition was in the hands of the justice minister American officials have said <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>'s case is a test of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s willingness to fight terrorism <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, 39, has been held by <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> since his arrest on a false passport charge in May 1988.

 The Soviet interior minister today branded <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> a liar and defended a government investigation into an alleged assassination attempt of the maverick lawmaker. The comments by minister <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> came less than 24 hours after <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> accused President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of staging a `` political farce'' in an attempt to scuttle <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s political career. <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> maintains that <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> appeared at a police post Sept. 28, dripping wet, and reported that men had assaulted him and thrown him off a bridge into the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, however, told the Supreme Soviet legislature this week he never reported such an incident and that no such attack occurred. `` I have presented only the official information I had from the policeman. I stated only what comrade <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told the policeman,'' <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> told reporters at a news conference called especially to discuss the affair. The interior minister's appearance before reporters showed the government was eager to deflect <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s accusations quickly. <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> `` lied publicly'' when he told his story to the Supreme Soviet in remarks later shown on nationwide television, and a second time a day later when he issued a statement to the press accusing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> trying to undermine him. `` In my view this is becoming particular to comrade <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> _ saying something then afterwards calling it persecution,'' <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> said. He also accused <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> of making a false report when he arrived at the police station. `` There was no attempt on his life,'' the minister said. `` These rumors are false.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> denied making a formal report of an assassination attempt but has not addressed whether he appeared at a police post soaking wet. In the statement to the Supreme Soviet, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> called the affair `` a new attempt to ruin my health and to knock me out of the sphere of political struggle.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had brought <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> into the leadership but had him fired in 1987 for criticizing the slow pace of reforms. He has gradually made a political comeback, winning 89 percent of the vote in March to become a member of the new <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> had recaptured a position in the government because of his criticism of authorities, casting himself as a victim and exploiting slogans popular with people. Asked if <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> would be prosecuted on charges of filing a false police report, <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> said there were no such plans. Besides, he said, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s status as a lawmaker means his fellow legislators would have to sanction any criminal investigation involving him. The interior minister defended <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s conduct in regard to his former protege. `` Any non-partisan observer would see that the general secretary of our party, comrade <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, has very loyally and correctly reacted to the declaration or conduct of comrade <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> also claimed <PERSON> Yelstin </PERSON> asked him in a telephone conversation not to investigate the incident further but the interior minister told reporters, `` I could not give this promise.'' He maintained that contrary to what <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> claimed in his statement, the investigation had not `` touched on his private life.''

 Some looting occurs, but disaster is far more likely to bring out the best in people than the worst, say experts on how people behave during calamities. `` Generally, overall criminal behavior drops off at the height of the emergency,'' says <PERSON> Enrico </PERSON> <PERSON> Quarantelli </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Disaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION>, commenting on reports of scattered violence and looting in the aftermath of the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake Tuesday. `` If you are an idiot before an earthquake, you're an idiot after an earthquake,'' adds <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Dynes </PERSON>, a sociologist at the same research unit, but he agrees that `` the evidence in situations like this is that looting is very minimal.'' Looting and violence were also noticed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on July 13-14, 1977, during a 25-hour power failure and in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, after Hurricane Hugo. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Croix </PERSON> was the scene of reckless looting this fall, but that was more an expression of political discontent than simple greed, said psychiatrist <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinglass </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, who does research on family responses to natural disasters. `` Hugo was just an excuse to allow an outpouring,'' he said. The earthquake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, too, triggered alienation toward the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, accused of denying aid in retaliation for the area's attempt to assert its independence from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Steinglass </PERSON> said Paradoxically, he said, disasters become a rewarding memory to those who survive them. `` Often people who have been through these experiences look back upon them as events that had a very positive influence on their lives,'' he said. The survivors are proud to have coped _ and survived. Looting gets a bigger role in accounts of disasters than it deserves, the experts say. `` There are lots of reports of it based on expectations,'' says <PERSON> Dynes </PERSON>. `` If one looks at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on any given night there are a certain number of arrests and the question is whether those incidents go up or down during disasters. By and large they go down.'' Psychologist <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, says television exaggerates the looting that does occur: `` You see one angry face smashing a car and it becomes something bigger in your own mind.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Courtless </PERSON>, a sociologist and law professor at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, says what happens during a disaster is that criminals take advantage of the special circumstances _ the police are tied up in rescue work. `` I do n't know when the stock market crashed whether this did n't open some opportunities for some pretty sharp operators, too,'' Courtless says `` What these situations have in common is the sense that ` I'm not going to get caught.''' Far more common in disasters than criminal behavior is heroism, says <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, a health psychologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Uniformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> who has done research on people's behavior in floods, tornadoes and other disasters `` People help each other and engage in rescue attempts. Disasters tend to bring out the more positive side of human nature,'' he says. `` As far back as Roman times there have been accounts of people looting and rioting,'' notes <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Silber </PERSON>, a psychologist at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's a theory called frustration-induced criminality _ the idea that those people who are most likely to be avid looters and to take advantage of social breakdown will be those who have the least,'' he adds. On the other hand, notes <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>, who is an expert on post-trauma stress, `` thumbing your nose at the adult community'' is common among all young men. The same phenomenon sends youths to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, in the spring to get drunk and `` find a way to break the rules.''

 This week's earthquake did n't damage just bridges and buildings. It ripped into a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Dream already frayed by smog, crowding and soaring real estate costs. Experts have warned for years that the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area would be hit someday by `` The Big One,'' a catastrophic earthquake they say will be worse than Tuesday's quake. Even the telephone book has instructions on what to do after an earthquake. The warnings have done little to slow a population explosion fueled by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s famous sunny weather and a healthy economy. `` You hear about Californians being so blase about earthquakes. Well, they have been,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> native who recently returned to the area after 10 years in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. `` But this is different,'' she said. `` The weather's really nice here, but something like this makes you question whether it's worth it. I've thought about leaving this area because of the rising cost of real estate and congestion. I guess this is one more reason.'' If she goes, she'll be in the minority, said real estate agents. The quake produced a temporary lull Wednesday in residential sales. `` People had other things on their minds,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> real estate agent <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahoian </PERSON>. But he predicted sales will be brisk again by next week in this overheated market, where a typical, three-bedroom house costs more than $ 250,000. `` It's not as if people have been unaware of the potential for earthquakes here,'' <PERSON> Shahoian </PERSON> said. Indeed, many Bay area residents seemed to be trying to live up to the laid-back image of Californians in the quake's aftermath. The order of the day in all but the hardest-hit zones was business as usual. Even as rescue workers dug through rubble to look for quake victims, tourists jockeyed for position to take snapshots of the damage. And just a few miles from where a section of Interstate 880 collapsed, killing an estimated 250 people, few shoppers at a <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> supermarket were stocking up on supplies in case an aftershock should hit. Most of them were just buying dinner. `` You take it in stride,'' said <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, whose purchases included candles to light her apartment, which was still without electricity Wednesday night. She needed the candles so she could see to clean up the broken glass and dishes that the quake had jarred loose in her apartment. And she was just getting to it Wednesday because the quake had stranded her across the bay in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> the night before. Still, she thinks <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> living is a breeze. `` It's better here than in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, where I come from. There, you get hurricanes, tornadoes _ and no opportunities, to boot.'' Many who survived the earthquake with no injury or property damage may take it as a sign that their lack of concern is justified. Real estate agent <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> said she knows many homeowners on the <ORGANIZATION> Hayward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fault </ORGANIZATION> _ a likely spot for earthquakes in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area _ who do n't bother to spend the extra $ 200 a year for quake insurance. They figure the gamble is worth the risk, she said. `` When was our last big one _ 1906?'' she asked, referring to the catastrophic quake that killed hundreds or perhaps throusands. `` Natives do n't seem to be as frightened as the out-of-staters,'' she said. `` Earthquakes are something we live with here.''

In two eastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> counties, dozens of residents remained stranded in remote hollows after floods destroyed small bridges or wiped out access roads. State disaster assessment teams toured flood-stricken areas in four counties on Wednesday and found hundreds of residents with homes damaged by the flood, and many without safe drinking water. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s temperatures were expected to tumble. A warning for freezing temperatures tonight was posted in the state's western and central parts. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> also was expected to be chilly.

Magistrate <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON> said he found `` a preponderance of evidence'' against <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON>, 44, to send the case to a grand jury. <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> was arrested last week at a hotel in <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and wss charged with delivering and attempting to deliver unauthorized information to agents of the Soviet government. At today's hearing, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Special Agent <PERSON> Lizzie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON>, who related conversations she had with <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> starting on Oct. 4. Ms. <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> came to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, accompanied by an official from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, to tell his story. According to the agent, <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> left his home near <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, last June and began an odyssey that took him from Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and back to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A mother has been arrested on charges she cut up her teen-age son with a shard of glass and rubbed salt in the wounds to drive `` evil spirits'' from him, police said. <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, 37, of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, was charged with assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature Monday. She remained jailed today without bond. She was arrested after a neighbor reported that Ms. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>' 14-year-old son, who was beaten and bleeding, sought refuge at his house Monday night, said sheriff's Deputy Mike Temple Temple said the boy had cuts all over his body from a piece of broken mirror and salt was rubbed into his wounds. The boy also had been forced to drink salt water, he said. `` This woman thought the boy was possessed and enlisted the help of her 12-year-old son to exorcise it,'' Temple said. `` This is one of the most bizarre cases I've ever seen.'' The 12-year-old apparently helped hold his brother down during the attack, said Sheriff's Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Skipper </PERSON>. The 14-year-old was taken to <LOCATION> Anderson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he spent Monday night, then was taken into protective custody and placed in foster care along with his younger brother, <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> said. Skipper said there were no other siblings and that the boys' father did not live in the area. All the mirrors but one were broken in Ms. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>' home and deputies confiscated a bloody shower curtain, <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Opposition leaders today criticized <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s new leader, <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, for his dedication to hard-line conservatism that has caused dissent across the country A pro-democracy protest was reported hours after <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> was appointed. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, who took over from <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> on Wednesday, made it clear in a speech that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will resist pro-democracy movements like those under way in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The change in leadership was praised in other <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries, but opposition leaders here said <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s style will not end dissatisfaction that has caused street protests and driven tens of tens of thousands of East Germans to flee West. Activists said today that about 1,000 people held a peaceful protest in the northern city of <LOCATION> Greifswald </LOCATION> hours after <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> was named party chief. The protesters reportedly demanded democratic reforms and the release of those detained during demonstrations earlier in the month. <PERSON> Reinhardt </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, a co-founder of the New Forum opposition group, said today, `` I do n't think that the protest movement will settle for a few cosmetic changes.'' Another government critic, East German author <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, told <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> RIAS </ORGANIZATION> radio in an interview Wednesday: `` The crisis will keep dragging on.'' `` Egon Krenz does n't enjoy any particular trust among the people,'' said <PERSON> Baerbel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohley </PERSON>, another New Forum leader. He blamed the 52-year-old leader for unleashing police forces that attacked pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Oct. 7 and Oct. 8. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> sources have said <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> ordered security forces to use more restraint in later demonstrations. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> named <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> to succeed his hard-line mentor, 77-year-old <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, who ruled the nation 18 years. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, the youngest member of the ruling Politburo, also will assume the duties of head of state and head of the military, replacing <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> in all three roles. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> said he stepped down because of health reasons, but rising public opposition to his authoritarian rule had fueled pressure for his resignation. More than 53,000 East Germans have fled the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in recent weeks via <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, authorities said today that more than 1,000 East German refugees crossed from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> since Wednesday morning. Most have gone on to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where they are granted automatic citizenship. Addressing East Germans on television a few hours after his elevation, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said discussion of change is important and promised the ruling party `` would initiate a new course.'' But he stressed that `` without the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> there would be no German Democratic Republic'' and indicated he does not intend to enter dialogue with opposition groups agitating for a more open society, free elections and a free press. `` Our society already has enough democratic forums in which different interests from various parts of the population'' can express themselves, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said. He hinted that rigid restrictions on travel abroad could be modified or lifted. The difficulty of getting permission to travel outside the country has been a chief complaint of protesters. The new leader also accused West German officials of meddling in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s affairs. The state-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said today that `` at the center of the demands and suggestions -LRB- for change -RRB- is the longing for deeds and decisions.'' The newspaper called for `` open, productive and democratic'' discussions of the nation's problems but said they should take place within the current socialist structure. West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, speaking at an East-West security conference in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, urged <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> to make `` fundamental reforms'' in the troubled nation and to make good on a pledge to talk to `` all levels of society.'' Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, whose reforms have been rejected by East German leaders but embraced by much of the populace, expressed confidence in a telegram published today that <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> will find solutions to the problems facing his country. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Communist president, <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, commended the contribution of <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> to the development of Polish-East German relations but said the new leadership will benefit the country. However, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s pro-Solidarity newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> may be a disappointing change for those who want greater change. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first government not led by Communists. The 24-member Cabinet has only four Communist ministers. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which also is moving toward democratic reforms, predicted that <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> may only be a transitional leader until a party congress due in May. The <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemzet </ORGANIZATION> daily, one of the more outspoken state-run newspapers, said that meeting could bring a breakthrough for more outspoken reformers. Two other Politburo members who had been heavily criticized within the party lost their jobs Wednesday. They were <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>, 60, who ran the country's news media and <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON>, 63, who made the East German economy the envy of its East European neighbors but had come under criticism for a lack of innovation.

 The nuclear-powered <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> probe raced across space today on its long voyage to <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>, while the five orbiting <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION> astronauts who released it began a day of other experiments. Zipping along at about 9,600 mph, the probe was more than 150,000 miles from Earth at mid-morning, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Galileo </PERSON> was deployed Wednesday night about six hours after the space shuttle thundered into orbit. `` Galileo is on its way to another world,'' Atlantis commander <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said shortly after the 6,700-pound probe was gently ejected from the shuttle's cargo bay by springs. The shuttle crew today ran some checks and pronounced the primary cooling system `` healthy.'' It had shut down automatically Wednesday when it became overheated, shifting to a backup. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said the problem was associated with the power needs of <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> when it was in the cargo bay. Mission Control awakened the space travelers today with a musical tribute to <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and pilot <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCulley </PERSON>, both naval aviators and graduates of <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Reveille was sandwiched between `` Hail Purdue'' and `` Anchors Aweigh.'' `` I liked the first song better than the second,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> responded. The successful deployment of Galileo occurred as planned at 6:15 p.m. CDT over the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>. `` Galileo looks absolutely super,'' radioed mission specialist <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucid </PERSON>, who was in charge of the deployment. `` It's too bad you all ca n't be here to see it.'' After <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCulley </PERSON> maneuvered the shuttle a safe distance away, a two-stage rocket attached to the probe fired the initial stage. The second `` burn'' occurred about five minutes later, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said both were successful. `` It achieved earth-escape velocity and is now heading outbound toward the sun,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> commentator <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said Wednesday night. A spacecraft can escape the Earth's gravity when traveling faster than 25,000 mph. Shortly after 8 p.m. CDT, <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported that the two-stage rocket and the probe had separated, and that <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> was `` on its own.'' <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> is powered by two electrical generators that are fueled by highly radioactive plutonium. Anti-nuclear activists opposed the use of plutonium but lost a lawsuit to block the launch. Although Jupiter is the probe's destination, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> also will swing around <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and sun during its 2.4-billion-mile journey. Gravity from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> will help the spacecraft gain momentum for its trip. During the six-year voyage, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> also will provide the first close-up data about asteroids, passing within 600 miles of Gaspra and <PERSON> Ida </PERSON>. Scientists hope the $ 1.5 billion <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> _ the most expensive unmanned space vehicle ever built _ will give the best look yet of another planet and find clues to the universe's origin when it reaches Jupiter. They believe the giant planet still holds much of the material, in its original state, from which the universe formed more than 15 billion years ago. A robot on <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> will dive through <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s hydrogen-rich atmosphere and radio back readings during the 75-minute plunge. But Galileo itself will continue a wide orbit around the planet for 22 months, keeping track of changes in its weather for the first long-term study of an outer planet. Atlantis' liftoff Wednesday was delayed twice _ once last week because of a faulty engine computer and then on Tuesday because of rain. But on Wednesday, Atlantis found a calm between two storm systems and blasted off from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The anti-nuclear activists, who were fearful a Challengerlike accident could spread radioactive contamination over <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, had threatened to infiltrate the launch site to stop the liftoff, but there were no incidents Wednesday. During the rest of the mission, scheduled to end Monday with a landing at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the astronauts will conduct several scientific and medical experiments. Other projects include an experiment to grow corn plants to see how they develop without gravity; one to heat and cool plasticlike materials to determine how they react in space; and a student experiment designed to grow ice crystals in microgravity. In addition, an instrument in the cargo bay will measure sections of the Earth's protective ozone layer in an attempt to calibrate that data with readings taken by nearly identical instruments on satellites. The other Atlantis crew members are mission specialists <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON>.

 Federal mine safety officials will require the mine where 10 men died in an explosion last month to correct 280 safety violations before it is allowed to reopen, a spokesman said. A list of citations against <ORGANIZATION> Pyro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was released Wednesday by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The violations, which included 253 judged to be `` significant and substantive,'' were found during an inspection following the blast at the William Station Mine near <LOCATION> Wheatcroft </LOCATION>. The western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> mine has been shut since the Sept. 13 methane gas explosion, the nation's worst mining disaster since 1984. <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION> spokeman <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said Pyro, which owns the mine, would `` have to submit necessary plans, make required changes before the mine is allowed to reopen.'' Attempts to reach officials at <ORGANIZATION> Costain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pyro </PERSON>'s parent company, Wednesday and today were unsuccessful A receptionist at <ORGANIZATION> Costain </ORGANIZATION>'s office in <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, said no officials were available for comment. The list released by <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION> did not give details of the violations. Mine safety officials found 12 violations `` highly likely'' to result in an accident or illness, while 241 were likely to result in an accident or illness. Eighteen violations represented a `` high degree'' of negligence, <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION> found, while 246 violations represented a moderate degree. Of the citations, 37 were issued in the area of fire protection; 43 in the area of electrical equipment-general; 16 in roof support; and 18 in the ventilation category. <ORGANIZATION> Costain </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulties </PERSON> said earlier that <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION> gave informal approval for the removal of a ventilation barrier at <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION>, an action that investigators say may have led to the fatal explosion. <PERSON> Schulties </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION> was `` well aware of this ventilation change we were going to make,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Lexington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald-Leader </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. The barrier was knocked down about 15 minutes before the fatal explosion. However, <PERSON> Rexford </PERSON> <PERSON> Music </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> district, said <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION> had not approved the barrier's removal. Music charged that <PERSON> Schulties </PERSON> was `` just trying to shift some responsibility, and it's not there to shift.'' Shortly after the accident, <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION> reported that the <LOCATION> Pyro </LOCATION> mine had been cited for 1,508 violations and fined $ 215,757 over the past seven years.

<TEXT>
 A former campaign treasurer for Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> has been indicted on five counts of mail fraud in the theft of $ 500,000 from the senator's campaign fund. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON>, indicted Wednesday, was contrite and planned to `` do everything he can to make restitution,'' said his lawyer, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehrens </PERSON>. `` He deeply regrets any embarrassment he has caused the senator.'' `` There is no great joy in seeing a friend indicted,'' <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said. `` I was very upset about this and still am, because I feel very much violated.'' <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., said he used his own money to pay about $ 50,000 in campaign-related bills that <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON> did not pay In addition, an audit of the fund will cost him $ 30,000 to $ 40,000, <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said. The indictment outlines charges dating to 1982 and accuses <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON> of devising a scheme to convert funds from political contributions to his personal use. If convicted, <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON> could face a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine on each of the five counts. <PERSON> Mehrens </PERSON> said much of the money went into tax shelters that the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> later disallowed. As a result, <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON> ended up owing the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, prompting him to divert more campaign funds, the lawyer said. <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON> also served briefly as campaign treasurer for Gov. Rose Mofford but resigned shortly before the <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> fund was found to be short in April.

 Computer controls and improved construction techniques are dramatically improving the ability of the nation's telephone network to withstand natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, telephone officials say During Tuesday's earthquake in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, millions of callers simultaneously went to their telephones to inquire of friends and relatives `` Are you OK?'' or `` Did you see the earthquake on TV?'' That huge upsurge in long-distance calling _ more than 2 -LCB- times normal nationwide between 8 p.m. and midnight Eastern Daylight Time _ could have caused chaos 20 or 30 years ago. This time, computers rerouted calls and selectively blocked others to keep the system from experiencing gridlock, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>'s network operations center in <LOCATION> Bedminster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> said the company received a record 144.7 million long-distance calls nationwide between midnight Tuesday and midnight Wednesday Approximately 123.6 million calls were completed Wednesday, <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> said. Volume early today in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> `` has diminished but continues to be above normal,'' <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> added. Thanks to improved phone equipment, `` We are able to manage the volume to at least not bring the system to a halt much more effectively than ever before. ... We do n't allow that extra load to bog the system down,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. When Hurricane Hugo slammed ashore in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> last month, people in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, received long-distance calls from relatives during the worst of the storm, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Creech </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. `` The reason they had that capability is that some 80 percent of our cables are underground,'' <PERSON> Creech </PERSON> said. Much of that cable is fiber-optic, which <PERSON> Creech </PERSON> said `` is much less susceptible to moisture or corrosion.'' Of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s 1 million customers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, 13,523 remained without service Wednesday, mostly because of water damage to inside wiring or downed lines to their homes, <PERSON> Creech </PERSON> said. `` By far, especially in this kind of situation, underground cable has proved to be the best in terms of service reliability,'' <PERSON> Creech </PERSON> said. Solid-state components, reinforced buildings, underground fiber-optic cable and redundant systems have improved the phone system dramatically from the days when high winds, snow or ice could knock out service for days. `` The physical construction has improved dramatically, just like the building construction on the high-rises'' in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. Equally powerful is <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's network of computers that sense where backlogs are developing and reroute traffic through other parts of the country. `` Unlike 20 or 30 years ago where you had very defined routing paths ... that could easily overload and congest, we essentially have a spider web around the country,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. `` The computers are smart enough to use any of the capability anywhere in the country. We can talk to those computers ... to make sure they allow enough of those calls through without gridlock,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. Sue <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON>, district manager for <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s network in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>'s phone network has been designed to withstand the largest earthquakes. `` We've done an awful lot of reinforcing ... at our central office locations, and we've done a lot of changes of our network,'' she said. To keep the phone system operating, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> blocked 60 to 70 percent of the incoming calls to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area and 30 percent of the outgoing calls, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint, the nation's No. 3 long-distance carrier, doubled its volume of calls immediately after the earthquake Tuesday night, said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Butson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>'s director of network management and control in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. Calls were running 40 percent above normal on Wednesday, <PERSON> Butson </PERSON> said. Sprint spokesman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermanson </PERSON> said the Sprint network `` functioned very well, no losses, no outages. We were n't hit.'' <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> officials said their system was functioning at capacity, but with no breakdowns. Like <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> were blocking many calls to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area.

<TEXT>
 A 15-second earthquake caused a transportation nightmare that will last for months as <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area residents cope with collapsed freeways, damaged bridges, landslides and twisted rail lines. With major arteries closed between <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to points south and east, freeways jammed up starting at dawn today in the populous southern section from from <LOCATION> Hayward </LOCATION> in the east to <LOCATION> Gilroy </LOCATION> in the west. Traffic in the northern part of the nine-county region was lighter, but gridlock was expected by midday. `` This is just a nightmare. This is something nobody ever believed would happen, to cut <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> off from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevin </PERSON>, 41, of <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>, who got up at 3 a.m. to drive into <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nevin </PERSON>, who normally commutes 18 miles, had a circuitous 45-mile trek. The <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> line between <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> closed Wednesday because of a reported leak in the tube under <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> but it reopened later. The load today was slightly less than the normal 50,000, said spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>. `` We expect people will be coming in a little later than usual because they're trying to figure out how best to get into the city.'' That link had become especially vital after the quake cut off a main route _ the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, where a 50-foot section collapsed. The subway closing left ferries as the only remaining direct link between the cities. Ferry service was bolstered from <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vessels. Motorists still may get across the bay using bridges north or south of the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, but each is at least 25 miles out of the way. <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> officials said the collapsed section of the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> was to be lifted today so they could estimate how long repairs will take. The quake also collapsed a 1 \ - mile section of Interstate 880, a major artery near the bridge Authorities estimated 250 people were killed when the highway's upper deck fell onto the lower level during rush hour. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who viewed the wreckage Wednesday from the air, said repairs could take 18 months. `` One of the things you are going to have to do is to plan how you are going to in the next year or year and a half deal with the fact that 880 is not going to be operational.'' In an effort to ease the burden for commuters, Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Catalina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruises </ORGANIZATION> sent four 700-passenger vessels to supplement ferry service, said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON>, general manager. Closer to the quake's epicenter, about 55 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, a landslide closed Highway 17 linking the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area with <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>. Del Corral, of <ORGANIZATION> Raisch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION>, said it will take at least two months to clear. Repairing the crippled highway network will cost at least $ 500 million, <ORGANIZATION> Caltrans </ORGANIZATION> officials told the state <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Caltrans </ORGANIZATION> also said surveyors were inspecting about 1,500 bridges within 50 miles of the epicenter. Quake-damaged rail lines into <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> stopped <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s northbound Coast Starlight at <LOCATION> Salinas </LOCATION>, about 60 miles from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> provided buses to either <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> or <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, where other trains continued the trip into the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. There were no immediate estimates on when the <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> lines would be fixed. The historic <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> passenger terminal in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> likely will be torn down because it was so damaged, officials said. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> was open, but some airlines cut operations due to quake-damaged terminals. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said the quake forced the carrier to cancel 16 of 136 daily flights Wednesday. <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> also was open, but its main runway was closed.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is considering a speed-up of its withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military dependents from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said today. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that since last spring, 6,300 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> personnel had either been relocated onto <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> or sent home. But there are still roughly 11,000 dependents in the country. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the newly appointed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military commander in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, Gen. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>, has asked his superiors to evacuate most dependents from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The newspaper, citing military sources in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> wanted the dependents evacuated to heighten the sense of war among his troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has pressed for the removal of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as leader of the Central American country. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on indictments charging drug trafficking. He recently quashed an attempted coup that received minimal support from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters the administration was reviewing whether the withdrawal of dependents `` should be accelerated -LRB- and -RRB- whether there should be any special efforts made.'' The `` ultimate purpose,'' he said, has always been to have `` people leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` We have been reviewing this matter since the spring, and we announced a program in May which called for the return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of many of the dependents in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' he said. As of July 1, he said, 6,300 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees and their dependents had either been sent home or relocated from civilian housing into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Currently, he said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 10,000 soldiers permanently assigned to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, 2,500 military people there on temporary duty, 7,700 military dependents, 2,700 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> civilian <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees and 3,300 civilian dependents. Asked whether the White House considered the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> akin to a state of war, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> replied: `` We have always said that there is a status involving some danger in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. That was the reason for our first actions, to try to move people, certainly dependents of military people, back onto the base. `` You'll recall incidents of harassment, people in some cases being assaulted physically. And so there has always been a dangerous situation there that we were trying to alleviate,'' he said. But pressed on whether it was amounted to war, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We have n't used that term.''

 Commonwealth leaders today said nations should put more financial pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and criticized an agreement by international banks to reschedule part of the country's foreign debt. Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> leaders were `` disappointed'' that foreign banks agreed to reschedule $ 8 billion of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s $ 20 billion debt. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, Finance Minister <PERSON> Barend </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Plessis </PERSON> welcomed the debt rescheduling as `` one of the most important international events for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> this year.'' News of the bank deal came as leaders of the 49-nation <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> met in closed session to debate sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which quit the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> in 1961. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the sole opponent of sanctions in the association of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and its former colonies, insists embargoes now would be irresponsible. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> defended her stand today and accused the Commonwealth of promoting poverty through embargoes. `` Our course is constructive. We want to help the people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' she said. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is proposing a sanction plan for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that calls on international banks to toughen lending conditions, including limiting maxium credit terms to 90 days. It also calls for setting up a monitoring agency to scrutinize <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s links with the international financial community. President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, at a news conference on the second day of the biennial summit, said bloodshed threatened to engulf southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Bankers are sucking at that blood by supporting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. They are bloodsuckers,'' he said. Commonwealth leaders, apart from Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, had planned to launch a new drive to try to stymie <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s efforts to reschedule the $ 8 billion of its foreign debt that is due next June. On Wednesday, Canadian officials said a three-nation <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> team of representatives from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has been lobbying major international banks and received what he called a `` favorable response.'' But within hours, the South African <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> announced it has reached a deal with the creditors, mostly American and European banks. On Wednesday Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, arguing that South African President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> deserves encouragement, urged the Commonwealth not to rebuff `` the most helpful sign for many years that progress was possible.'' She cited <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s release this week of eight black nationalist leaders, relaxation of restrictions on anti-government demonstrations and his `` willingness to consult all shades of opinion.'' <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> proposes maintaining existing sanctions but holding off on new ones for six months as a challenge to de Klerk to get the white-dominated Parliament to abolish race laws by then. The laws include regulations that deny the black majority the vote and segregate residential areas and health services. Commonwealth officials predicted that the six-month moratorium proposal was likely to be supported, although reluctantly, by some African and Asian countries. Most Commonwealth leaders maintain that sanctions, although unevenly applied, have forced <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to move toward change. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, a major South African trading partner, has long argued that sanctions hurt blacks most and increase white resistance to change. A list of <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> sanctions drawn up in 1986 included bans on air links, imports of farm produce and a range of other goods. As a compromise, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> agreed to a handful of the embargoes. Black southern <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries, which depend economically on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, have also taken only limited measures.

 Spanish novelist and essayist <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>, who used the horrors of the Spanish Civil War to infuse his work with an often grotesque and violent imagery, today won the Nobel Prize in literature. <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>, 73, was cited by the Swedish Academy for his `` rich and intensive prose, which with restrained compassion forms a challenging vision of man's vulnerability.'' <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> was the fifth Spaniard to win the Nobel Prize in literature. He said he felt he shared the award with many other Spanish and Latin American writers. `` For me this is something I ` m very proud of,'' <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> from his home in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` I offer it to all of literature in Spanish. I believe that other authors, Spanish and Latin American, who write in Spanish could also have won it for the same reasons as I, but, in the end, I won it, and I'm very, very happy.'' <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>'s best known work is the 1942 novel `` The Family of <PERSON> Pascual </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>,'' in which he created a new literary style known as `` tremendismo,'' emphasizing violence and grotesque imagery. The novel, a first-person account of a murderer awaiting execution, was banned in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> but established <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>'s reputation as a writer. It was considered the most important postwar novel and set a new direction for Spanish literature toward concise and sober writing. <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>'s masterpiece is considered `` The Hive,'' from 1951, which captures three days in the life of <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> four years after the civil war. <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> has written 10 novels among his 70 works of travelogs, short stories and poetry. The Swedish Academy called him `` the leading figure in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s literary renewal during the postwar era. `` <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> is a restless spirit,'' who often expresses himself `` in an old <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> tradition of hilarious grotesqueness,'' it said. <PERSON> Sture </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, the Academy's secretary, called <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> `` provocative and innovative'' in both his form and subject matter. `` The Family of <PERSON> Pascual </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'' was probably the most widely read Spanish novel since `` <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Quixote </PERSON>,'' the Academy said. It also singled out as `` a sensation'' his 1969 novel `` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Camilo </LOCATION>,'' which describes the weeks before the outbreak of civil war. <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> was the first Spaniard to win the Nobel since 1977, when it was awarded to poet <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleixandre </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> was chosen from about 150 candidates, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. The prize this year is worth about $ 463,000. As publisher of the literary magazine `` Papeles de Son Armadans'' from 1956 to 1979, <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> also was credited for providing a forum for young opposition writers during the `` years of hardship,'' a reference to the dictatorship of Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>. His writing `` broadened the range of Spanish writing'' and widely influenced Latin American literature, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said after reading the citation to reporters at the Academy's 18th century headquarters. <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> was born May 11, 1916, in the town of <LOCATION> Iria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flavia </LOCATION> to a middle class family that counted among its forebearers both <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> aristocrats and English pirates. His medical studies were interrupted by the 1936-39 Civil War. Suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, he returned to his native <LOCATION> Galicia </LOCATION> district, which was controlled by <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>'s Nationalists. Forced to join the Nationalists as a private, he was seriously wounded. After the war he began studying law in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> but devoted much of his time to writing. He turned to writing full time after producing `` The Family of <PERSON> Pascual </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>.'' In 1977, King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> a senator in the first Spanish Parliament, and he assisted in writing the Spanish Constitution in 1978. He received the 1987 Prince of <ORGANIZATION> Asturias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Award </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literature </ORGANIZATION>, given by a foundation named for the heir to the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> throne, and has been a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> literary group since 1957. Other well-known works by <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> include `` Journey to the Alcarria'' from 1948, a diary of his walking trip through rural <PERSON> Castille </PERSON>, and `` Jews, Moors and Christians'' from 1956, an essay of the impact of religion on Spanish history. The Nobel Prize in literature was the last of the six prizes to be awarded for 1989. All were worth $ 463,000 this year. The Nobel Peace Prize was given to the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, the exiled spiritual and political leader of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, for his non-violent struggle to free his Himalayan nation from Chinese rule. The prize in medicine went to <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for their discovery of a family of genes that helped scientists better understand how cancer develops. <PERSON> Trygve </PERSON> <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> won the prize in economics for showing that mathematical probabilities could be used to predict the puzzling shifts in the economy. American <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cech </PERSON> and Canadian-born <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen since 1984, won the chemistry prize for their work with the genetic material RNA. The physics prize was awarded to American <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> for the atomic clock used as the international time standard and to American <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dehmelt </PERSON> and West German <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> for a method to isolate single atoms. The prizes were first given in 1901 from the estate of <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobel </PERSON>, the inventor of dynamite.

 The winner of this year's Nobel Prize in literature, <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>, is better known in his homeland for his love of food, travel and women than for his 10 novels and numerous short stories and travelogues. <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> received the Nobel Prize in literature today, becoming the fifth Spaniard to do so. Although his best-known novels, `` The Family of Pascual Duarte'' and `` The Hive,'' have been successfully translated into films, he is known to most Spaniards for his sojourns through <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in a Rolls <PERSON> Royce </PERSON>, for his love of crude expressions and for his flamboyant lifestyle. The 73-year-old writer most recently made news when he publicly acknowledged a romantic liaison with <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> Castano </PERSON>, a woman half his age who is his muse and literary helpmate. <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> is separated but not divorced from his wife of many years and has one son, <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> <PERSON> Conde </PERSON>, who acknowledged last week in a radio interview that it was difficult being the offspring of such a public character. Ms. <PERSON> Castano </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> still writes everything in longhand and has no idea how to operate a typewriter or a word processor. <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> told reporters he was `` not really surprised'' by the news he had received the award but said it could just as well have gone to many other Spanish writers. `` But life is like a game of tennis, and this time I won,'' he said. He said the $ 463,000 prize will `` come in very handy.'' `` I'll use it to pay my debts, and believe me, I've got a lot of them.'' He said <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has been overshadowed by <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in literature for some time because of its `` foolish provincialism.'' `` The Family of Pascual Duarte'' from 1942, <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>'s first novel, was first published in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> because it was deemed too violent and crude for <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> at the time. It tells the story in uncommonly straightforward language of a rural, uneducated man who commits a series of brutal murders without really knowing why and ends up being executed. It often is credited with creating a sort of literary vanguard in the years immediately following the bloody 1936-39 Civil War. `` The Hive'' takes place in the cold, depressing postwar years and tells the story of starving writers who would sit for hours during the winter in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s literary cafes. <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> said he is working on a new project now, but he refused to say what it is. `` You never really know how these things are going to turn out until the end.'' <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> was the first Spanish novelist to win the Nobel prize. In 1977, two years after the death of 36-year dictator Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleixandre </PERSON>, an obscure poet from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s pre-war literary generation, received the Nobel Prize for literature Fellow poet <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> received the award in 1956. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s first literary Nobel laureate was playwright <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Echegaray </PERSON>, who won in 1904. Playwright <PERSON> Jacinto </PERSON> <PERSON> Benavente </PERSON> won the award in 1922.

 The vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel that heard four weeks of evidence against federal Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> this summer said today he will vote to acquit the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> jurist in his impeachment trial. `` On the totality of this record ... weighing the incriminating circumstantial inferences against the exonerating factors and giving due weight to his other unblemished lifetime record, I conclude there is insufficent evidence to convict,'' Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., said of the bribery conspiracy charge against <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, the top Republican on the evidence panel, also said in a 76-page paper that he would vote to acquit <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of charges that he lied to a jury that found him innocent of bribery conspiracy charges in 1983. Prosecutors in that case told the jury that testimony from <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was false, <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> said. `` Obviously the jury did not accept those arguments.'' He said impeachment evidence that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> had improperly disclosed information obtained from a wiretap `` was neither convincing nor substantial.'' <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>'s comments came as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> prepared to close its doors and deliberate the charges against <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>. In final arguments the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was urged on Wednesday to disregard race as a factor in the case and decide the matter soley on the facts. `` There have been a lot of cases in our judicial system in which race has been a problem,'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday `` This is n't one of them or I would be the first to tell you.'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, the first black federal judge in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> history, is accused of conspiring to get a $ 150,000 payoff and lying to a jury that acquitted him of the charges in 1983. He also is accused of improperly disclosing information obtained from a government wiretap. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> heard final arguments Wednesday and planned to deliberate behind closed doors today. A vote is expected before the weekend. `` I wish I could be a fly on the wall for those deliberations,'' said the 53-year-old <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> as he emerged from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber. Conviction by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on any of the 17 impeachment articles approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in August 1988 would immediately remove <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District bench in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and stop his $ 89,500 salary. It would make <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> the sixth official in history removed by impeachment. The most recent was Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> in 1986 who fought in vain to remain on the bench while serving a tax fraud sentence. District Judge <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, convicted of lying to a grand jury, is also currently fighting to remain on the federal bench. <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, a leading House proponent of civil rights legislation, warned against any notion that race was a factor in the <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> case. He said <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was given a position of trust `` but he has betrayed that trust and he has betrayed those who looked to him for leadership.'' `` We did not wage the civil rights struggle in order to trade one form of judicial corruption for another,'' <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> galleries, filled about equally with black and white faces, broke into applause after <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> himself took the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor and denied he was claiming racial discrimination as part of his defense. `` I am not guilty of having committed any crime _ that is my defense,'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said. `` Please act fairly.'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> told senators the evidence was only circumstantial. `` What you have here is Swiss cheese,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> appeared at a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> restaurant at a time set by an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> undercover agent who was part of a `` sting'' operation against a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer claiming the power to influence the judge's actions The judge also ordered the government to return $ 845,000 in confiscated funds as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Borders </PERSON> said he would in negotiations with the undercover agent. Both actions were offered by Borders as proof that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> would do as he was told and change two prison sentences to probation for a $ 150,000 bribe. House managers rejected a contention that the impeachment trial was unfair in light of his previous acquittal. `` What if all the facts indicate the judge's guilt?'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` We deeply believe that Judge <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> conspired to obtain a bribe from defendants in his court, that to avoid conviction for this crime he fabricated evidence and lied to a federal jury 14 times.''

 An appeals court today threw out the convictions of four people blamed in a 1975 <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> terrorist bombing after the government said investigators may have faked evidence. Relatives and others in the gallery of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bailey </LOCATION> court cheered as Lord <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, the chief justice, announced that the convictions had been reversed. The court also reversed the convictions of two of the four in a second bombing. `` I've been in prison for 15 years for something I did n't do,'' <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>, 35, shouted to a cheering crowd outside the court as he walked free. Two co-defendants also were freed. A fourth was freed and then immediately arrested in connection with a murder case in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. In addition to <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>, the defendants included <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 32, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, 39, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 35. They were sentenced to life in prison for killing five people in an explosion at a pub in <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, on October 5, 1974. But new evidence `` throws such doubt upon the honesty and integrity of a number of the <LOCATION> Surrey </LOCATION> officers investigating this case in 1974 that the Crown now feels unable to say that the convictions of any of the four are safe or satisfactory,'' <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Amlot </PERSON> of the Office of Public Prosecutions told the hearing. <PERSON> Amlot </PERSON> said there was evidence that officers had altered notes of interviews and, in one case, covered up the fact that a defendant had been interviewed after being charged, a violation of English law. `` It is clear that a full criminal investigation of these matters is called for,'' Amlot added. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> also were convicted of a pub bombing in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> suburb of <ORGANIZATION> Woolwich </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 6, 1974, which killed two people and injured 26. The appeals court also reversed those convictions. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, who was also serving a life sentence for the murder of a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> soldier in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, was rearrested as he left court. He was to fly today to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, where his attorneys said they would ask a court to release him on bail pending an appeal of the murder conviction. The prosecution's case in the bombings was based solely on confessions the four repudiated in court. The convictions were upheld in 1977 even after four members of an <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> gang made their own detailed confessions in the attacks. The presence in court of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>, reflected the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government's efforts to have this case and other bombing cases from the 1970s reviewed. In 1980, <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Denning </PERSON>, then the chief civil judge in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, ruled against the six, who claimed police had beaten them. Justice, a non-partisan legal reform group led by a former appeals judge, said in July that false confessions were a leading cause of unjust criminal verdicts, of which it estimated there were 15 or more every year in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.

 Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said he was `` ticked off'' that Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had time for television cameras but not for him during a tour of earthquake-damaged areas of the city. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who promised federal relief for earthquake victims after visiting the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area Wednesday, today dismissed the liberal Democratic mayor's criticism. `` I would hope that the mayor would resist any kind of political rhetoric at this time and concentrate all the energies and all of our dedication to helping the victims and helping the families of the victims, and let's get the situation stabilized first,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Morning.'' And on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show, he said that he thought it was `` very unfortunate to take that kind of a shot at a very difficult time. ... I was there to help people.'' <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said Wednesday he was `` ticked off'' that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` flies around in a helicopter, makes a bunch of television spots'' but did n't meet with him. The mayor had said before <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit that he planned to meet with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to urge immediate federal help. `` I understand he was in the <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> and in the shelters and then left. If he did so without visiting the mayor, I have real questions about what he was doing here. It may have been just a publicity stunt,'' <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he would go to the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area on Friday and presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> would be invited to a session between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and local officials. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> denied that the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice president had snubbed <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> was invited to two meetings with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` and he declined to attend both meetings,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Furthermore, `` we offered to send a helicopter to pick him up wherever he was and deliver him to the meetings and he declined that.'' White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> has `` been trying to reach him on the phone for several days and he has declined to talk to us,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We regret very much that the mayor of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> has decided not to cooperate with us in this matter.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met with officials in <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> across <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> to assess the need for federal assistance. On his tour, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> appeared stunned by the magnitude of damage and loss of life inflicted by the temblor. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, spent six hours touring the area by helicopter and on foot after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> authorized federal disaster assistance. Upon his return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> late Wednesday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that federal aid would be forthcoming. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, accompanied by <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., met with mayors of more than half a dozen cities around the bay and emergency officials at the <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> `` My impression was one of great sadness for the number of people that lost their lives and the families that are impacted,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said after seeing crushed cars on collapsed portions of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> and Interstate 880 in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. `` You ca n't help but be impressed by the magnitude of the earthquake,'' he said. `` To see 880 flattened like a pancake, it's really a sobering sight.

 Two mannequins wearing the latest fashions stood undamaged in the window of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s Department Store. Around them, the rubble of caved-in roofs, crumbled walls and shattered windows littered the sidewalks. Tuesday's earthquake caused only four known deaths here, but the damage was among the worst.

Protesters said authorities tried to break up the march. `` Police grabbed people who went by, knocking them with billy clubs,'' said <PERSON> Ericka </PERSON> <PERSON> Burchett </PERSON>. Protesters urged officials to continue searching under floodlights. Police spokesman <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> said the lights would create too many shadows for an effective search. The shop was one of six buildings that collapsed entirely, said <PERSON> Wormhoudt </PERSON>. `` This is as bad a catastrophe as anyone could imagine for the city. The downtown business district as we knew it _ with many historical buildings _ is gone. It will be built again, but it will not be the downtown that we knew.'' An estimated 20 downtown commercial buildings must be razed _ `` the heart of the community and its vitality,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION>. The quake's epicenter was about eight miles northeast of the city of 45,000 people, 75 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Turn-of-the-century stores made of brick bore the brunt of the quake as walls toppled onto sidewalks, and roofs crashed through ceilings onto merchandise below. One wall of the Metropole Hotel slammed onto the department store roof, spewing rubble over the floor. A rack of dust-covered dresses lay draped on the windowsill and sidewalk, near the mannequins. Merchants hoping to return to business, and residents of downtown hotels were kept behind yellow ribbons placed to keep all but emergency personnel out until structures were declared safe. `` I no longer have a home,'' wailed <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Madden </PERSON>, who lived in and worked at the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>. The town's most popular attraction, the beachside boardwalk next to <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, showed some cracks in its games building. There was no visible damage to the wooden Giant Dipper roller coaster. Across the street, 25 residents of a senior citizens hotel were evacuated to a church because of cracks in the hotel. `` Everyone is hurt, and everyone is going to need help with the recovery,'' said County Supervisor <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Keely </PERSON>. Residents shopped at the few stores that were open, stocking up on bottled water because officials warned the city supply might not be safe, and charcoal briquets and batteries in case the electricity remained off. Lights were restored to part of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> by midafternoon. Four of those arrested Wednesday night would be charged with disobeying a police officer, and the fifth with hitting an officer, <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Haebe </PERSON> was not optimistic about the woman's survival. `` We have search and rescue dogs that specialize in finding people who are buried, but they did not key into any sign of life,'' <PERSON> Haebe </PERSON> said. `` If there would have been even a hint of life, we would have taken more extraordinary steps.'' The woman's friends refused to give up hope. `` She's a strong woman and I think she could still be alive,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gfeller </PERSON>.

 The city is fining itself $ 2,100 for violating its own odor pollution rules. The enforcement is an outgrowth of Mayor <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazouri </PERSON>'s anti-odor campaign to rid the city of its smelly reputation, and several private companies have been charged with violations As part of a settlement announced Wednesday, the city Wastewater Division has agreed to a plan in which numerous measures will be taken to reduce odor, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Woosley </PERSON>, an associate engineer with the city's Bio-Environmental Services Division. The $ 2,100 fine is to be paid to that division. The Buckman Street sewage treatment plant was cited for odor pollution in May after the pollution division validated six complaints. As part of the compliance plan, the sewage plant will be granted a one-year exemption from the city's odor pollution law while the improvements are being made.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A military transport plane carrying paratroopers to keep order in the ethnically torn southern republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> lost an engine and crashed in the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, killing all 57 people aboard, it was reported Thursday. The left engine of the Ilyushin-76 plane caught fire minutes after it took off from an unidentified airport in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> part of the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Military </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The fire spread so fast that within three minutes, the engine fell off, but the fire did not stop,'' the newspaper reported, quoting Col. Gen. <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pankin </PERSON>. He said Cmdr. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalmikov </PERSON>, 48, had tried to fly the crippled plane back to the airport. A few miles from his goal, `` the <PERSON> Ilyushin </PERSON> careened sharply to the left and fell'' into shallow water less than a mile from shore, the newspaper said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not say more precisely where or when the crash occurred. It said the huge transport plane carried a crew of seven as well as 50 passengers. Interior Minister <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> told a news conference that rescuers initially believed some of those on board might have survived. `` It was during the night so rescue work was very difficult,'' he said. Workers recovered parts of the engines and fuselage from the water, he said. Specialists were searching for the plane's `` black box,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said, using the Western term for an aircraft voice and data recorder that might shed light on the reason for the crash. The Il-76 has four turbofan engines. Its wings are mounted atop the fuselage and are 150 feet long, according to <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s All the World's Aircraft. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> expressed its deep condolences to the families of the dead,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Troops have been patrolling <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> since last year to prevent more violence between residents feuding over the district of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. More than 100 people have died in violence related to the dispute.

<HEAD>15 Dissident Workers Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fifteen dissident workers have been arrested for organizing illegal strikes as part of a campaign to promote socialist ideology, police said Thursday. Charges will be filed after further investigation, they said. Police said the workers were arrested Wednesday in raids on houses near factories west of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, and more arrests are possible. The workers, all college graduates, set up a dissident labor organization called the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> last year and have instigated 20 illegal strikes, police said. In a strike at a kitchen utensil manufacturing plant, two workers and a company executive were burned to death in a fire started by union members, police said. The alliance sought to promote socialism and spread propaganda bills and newsletters accusing the government of suppressing labor activity, police said. Also on Thursday, about 500 fired teachers continued sit-ins at offices of the three main opposition parties for a second straight day, demanding their outlawed labor union be sanctioned. The teachers demanded that the three opposition parties, which control a majority of seats in the 299-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, agree to a bill legalizing the formation of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s first teachers' union. The government outlawed a union formed by dissident teachers this year and fired about 2,000 teachers who refused to give up membership. About a dozen union members also were arrested. There are about 300,000 primary, middle and high school teachers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

 A major earthquake struck rural north <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> early today, killing at least 29 people and flattening about 8,000 homes, official reports said. A three-paragraph report by the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said 34 people were injured. It said aftershocks continued. The quake was centered about 135 miles west of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on the border of <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION> provinces, and was felt in the capital. The epicenter was near <LOCATION> Datong </LOCATION>, famous for its Yungang Caves that hold thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> paintings and statues dating back to the 5th century. It was not known if the quake damaged any of the caves. Efforts to reach <LOCATION> Datong </LOCATION> by telephone were not successful. The Chinese quake came less than 24 hours after a massive earthquake hit <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> officials said there was no evidence of a link between the two temblors. <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> director, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhangsun </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> that additional strong aftershocks were unlikely. He said transportation and communications in the quake area remained intact and that relief work was being carried out, but he gave no details. An official at the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, in charge of disaster relief, said: `` We're looking into it now. Call us back tomorrow.'' The affected region is a dry, windswept farming area, where the main crops are wheat and other grains and most people live in one-story homes of unfired clay bricks. Such buildings easily collapse in an strong quake. <PERSON> Shanxi </PERSON> also is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s main coal-producing province and the stark brown land is pocked with coal mines. The <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said the first quake hit at 10:57 p.m. Wednesday -LRB- 10:57 a.m. EDT -RRB- and measured 5.7 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. At least four others registering 5 or above hit in the next six hours, including a quake of 6 on the scale at about 1 a.m. today. An aftershock measuring 5.1 hit at 6:29 p.m., <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said. More than 300 lesser aftershocks were recorded. Earthquakes are frequent in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, with the most recent serious tremor injuring 54 people and destroying 4,000 homes in southwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province last month. Five earthquakes, measuring up to 6.7 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, struck western <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> in a three-week period in June and July, killing 11 people. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s worst earthquake in recent history leveled the northeast city of <LOCATION> Tangshan </LOCATION> in 1976, leaving 240,000 dead by official count. Unofficial estimates have put the death toll at three times that number. Its magnitude was estimated at 8.0. The Richter scale is a measure off ground movement as recorded by seismographs. The open-ended scale is logarithmic, meaning that each degree of intensity is 10 times stronger than the last. Thus the 6.9 magnitude quake that hit <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Tuesday evening is 10 times stronger than one registering 5.9 on the scale.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today defeated a proposed constitutional amendment to ban burning and desecration of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag, delivering a sharp rebuff to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on a high-profile issue. The vote was 51-48 in favor, but constitutional amendments require approval by a two-thirds margin in both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote thus fell far short. `` We can support the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag without changing the American Constitution,'' Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, declared before the vote. The measure would authorize the state and federal governments to ban burning and desecration of the flag. Eighteen Democrats joined 33 Republicans in support of the amendment, while 37 Democrats and 11 Republicans voted against it. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeatedly called for approval of such a measure, saying a simple statute such as one approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week would be inadequate. Critics of the amendment said it amounted to tampering the constitutional right of Americans to freedom of expression. But they also expressed concern that opposition could be turned against them at election time in view of the power of the flag as a political symbol as demonstrated in last year's campaign. Those concerns appeared to ease a bit in recent days. Asked why that was, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told reporters this morning: `` I think the sound judgment of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' Other lawmakers said they thought most Americans are not very concerned about the amendment. `` We in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have chosen not to take the easy way out,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have chosen not to silence those who are wrong. We have chosen instead to challenge them with the truth.'' Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., making a final appeal for the measure, declared that `` the flag stands alone as a unique symbol of our hopes and our aspirations and our ideals as a nation. `` To say that the act of flag burning is somehow deeply enshrined in the First Amendment is preposterous,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. He said it was wrong in view of law that `` make it illegal to rip the warning label off your own mattress in some states.'' To be approved, the proposed amendment needed 66 votes, equal to two-thirds of the senators present and voting. It thus fell 15 votes short. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was glum in reacting to the vote, although it did not come as a surprise. `` I think the flag should be flown at half-staff after this vote,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told colleagues that `` we did good work. `` We saved the flag and preserved the Constitution,'' he said. Republican sponsors said the measure would end once and for all the controversy over whether laws against flag-burning are unconstitutional. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in June threw out the conviction of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> flag-burner <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, ruling that his freedom of speech had been violated. Within days <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for a constitutional amendment. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved last week and sent to the president a bill that would ban flag-burning by simple statute. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would allow it to become law without his signature and vowed to press on for the amendment. Democratic critics said the amendment amounted to tampering with the Bill of Rights. They said a simple statute would be better and that amending the Constitution should only be a last resort. Some Democratic senators said there was concern among lawmakers that opponents of the amendment would find their patriotism under attack at election time. Others said most Americans were not worried about the issue. Democrats also directed fire at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over his support for the measure. `` I would have to be naive if I did n't think his motives have a political bias,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>. After the vote, he predicted, `` the politics will have favored those who voted for this ill-conceived amendment _ tragic but true.'' Sen. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss., said he had heard the theory that passions have cooled on the flag issue but said they could be reignited `` Just wait,'' <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> said. He told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that if there were another high-profile flag-burning incident `` the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people will rise again.'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said the amendment demanded a `` kind of loyalty -LRB- that -RRB- is a hallmark of communist countris and right-wing dictatorships.'' Rejecting the amendment would be `` saying to the nation that there is a limit to how shallow our politics can be,'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said.

 Heavy, wet snow falling over the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> caused widespread power outages in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> today, with <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> among the cities setting records for earliest measurable snowfall. Tens of thousands of homes and businesses in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and hundreds in the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> area and southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> were blacked out when snow caused branches to snap onto power lines. Some schools were closed. Three to 5 inches of snow fell overnight in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> and other areas of southwestern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. It was the earliest snowfall in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> since 1912. The snow followed a drop in temperatures from the upper 70s and low 80s Monday and Tuesday into the upper 20s and low 30s early today. Two <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> radio stations were knocked off the air temporarily by the power outages, which affected an estimated 100,000 customers in the area. Up to 3 inches of wet snow that melted quickly was reported in other areas of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> reported 20,000 customers in the <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> area were briefly without service this morning, said spokesman <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> DiNicola </PERSON>. About 10,000 <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> customers in central <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> were without service between 4 and 4:30 a.m., but fewer than 100 remained without power by 8:30 a.m., said spokesman <PERSON> Barrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>. The snow was caused by a low pressure system over the southeastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, combined with a high-level system over <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> that pumped arctic air into the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. A snow advisory was issued for all of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> through tonight. By midmorning, <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, due east of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> border, and <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, further north, reported 3 inches of snow, the weather service said. Weather-watchers in <LOCATION> Elwood </LOCATION>, just north of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, reported snowfall of 5 inches. The heavy flakes stacked up on leafy trees, breaking boughs that snapped power lines across central <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Several hundred <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> customers were without electricity because of broken lines this morning after 2 inches of snow fell. Hundreds of Public Service <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> customers were without power in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Martinsville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Connersville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Clarksville </LOCATION>, all in southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Plainfield </LOCATION>, said no precise figures of the number of customers affected were available. She said crews were brought in from unaffected areas to help restore power. The snowfall was the deepest on record in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> since the weather service began keeping records in 1885, said meteorologist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>. The previous record of 1.4 inches had stood since 1925. Today's snowfall broke a record for the earliest measurable snow set Oct. 20, 1916, in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, which had early morning snow flurries. Snow also fell over most of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, where warm ground temperatures kept it from accumulating. East-central Illinois was `` getting hit pretty good with snow this morning,'' said <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, a weather service forecaster in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` We would expect the heaviest snow to fall in that area over the next 24 hours _ 1 to 3 inches, possibly 4 inches.'' <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Wednesday tied its record for earliest measurable snowfall, set on Oct. 18, 1972.

<HEAD>Average Retiree's Social Security Check Going Up $25</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Inflation, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The nation's 38.9 million Social Security beneficiaries can count on a 4.7 percent benefit increase in January that will boost the average retired worker's pension by $ 25 a month, the government said Thursday. The annual cost-of-living adjustment, the biggest in 7 -LCB- years, will increase the typical benefit check to $ 566 a month, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said. For someone who retires at age 65 in 1990, the maximum monthly benefit will be $ 975, up from $ 899 this year. The raise, announced after the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> released its consumer price report for September, mirrors the inflation rate for urban wage earners and clerical workers from the third quarter of 1988 through the same period this year. `` Social Security's 39 million beneficiaries, including the elderly and disabled reliant upon fixed incomes, can rest assured their buying power will be maintained,'' Social Security Commissioner <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said in a statement. The increase will show up in checks delivered Jan. 3, representing benefits earned for December. The government also announced Thursday that so-called wage base _ the maximum amount of earnings subject to the payroll tax that finances Social Security benefits _ will rise from the current $ 48,000 to $ 50,400 next year. Only about 10.4 million of the 130 million workers subject to the payroll tax had earnings that exceeded the wage base this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said. However, all workers and employers face higher payroll taxes next year, since the tax rate rises from 7.51 percent to 7.65 percent, an increase that was approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> back in 1977. The two changes _ higher wage base and higher tax rate _ mean the maximum tax on employees will jump by $ 250.80, to $ 3,855.60, in 1990 for workers earning over $ 50,400. Employers match their workers' contributions. Tax rates for the self-employed rise from 13.02 percent this year to 15.30 percent in 1990, when half of the taxes can be deducted as a business expense. The wage base is the same as for other workers. Next year's benefits increase will be the biggest since a 7.4 percent raise in July 1982, when high inflation rates translated into bigger cost-of-living adjustments. Benefits rose 4 percent in 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> gave the following examples of how the benefit increase will affect average monthly benefits. _ Aged couple, both getting benefits: up $ 43 to $ 966 _ Widowed mother and two children: up $ 53 to $ 1,173 _ Aged widow living alone: up $ 24 to $ 522 _ Disabled worker, spouse and children: up $ 44 to $ 975 _ All disabled workers: up $ 24 to $ 555 Of the 38.9 million people receiving monthly Social Security benefits, 62 percent are retired workers, 7 percent are disabled workers and 31 percent are spouses or children of retired, disabled or deceased workers. For the elderly and disabled, the increase in Social Security benefits will be partially offset by an extra $ 2 a month in Medicare premiums, which rise to $ 33.90 in 1990. The premiums are deducted directly from Social Security checks. The nation's 4.5 million recipients of <ORGANIZATION> Supplemental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Income </ORGANIZATION>, a federal program which provides a minimum income floor for poor people who are aged, blind or disabled, also will receive a 4.7 percent benefit increase at year's end. The maximum SSI payment will rise by $ 18 to $ 386 for an individual, and by $ 26 to $ 579 for a couple. The first affected SSI checks will be delivered Dec. 29. Other changes for 1990 announced Thursday include: _ Beneficiaries aged 65-69 will be able to earn up to $ 9,360 a year without losing some or all of their Social Security benefits, up from $ 8,880 this year <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, is considering raising the limit even higher. _ Beneficiaries under 65 will be able to earn $ 6,840 a year without penalty, up from $ 6,480 _ Workers will need to earn $ 520 for a quarter of coverage, up from $ 500 The higher Social Security payments will increase the cost of benefits by about $ 11 billion from this year's level of $ 230 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> will have to spend an added $ 575 million for the higher SSI benefits.

<TEXT>
 The chief editor of Pravda, the nation's most authoritative newspaper, was fired today and replaced by a confidante of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as a week of Kremlin wrangling over the press took a dramatic new turn. An aide said <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>, who has headed the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper since the days of <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, would move to the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. Sources said <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>'s replacement will be <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>, a philosopher and former editor of the journal <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON> who has been an advisor to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for the last year. One well-placed Soviet source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the move would give <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his reformist allies control of Pravda, whose circulation is dropping as it lags behind other newspapers championing franker coverage of national affairs. The newspaper recently suffered an embarrassment when it published an Italian newspaper's article claiming the popular Communist maverick <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> boozed and shopped his way through the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during a recent speaking tour. A few days later, Pravda apologized to readers, saying the story was based on hearsay and could not be substantiated. The aide, <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Popov </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>'s replacement would be announced in Friday's editions of Pravda. `` Tomorrow you'll read all, that he's going to the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Popov </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The replacement of <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>, 66, follows a special party meeting on the press that appeared to be aimed at reformist rather than conservatives such as the editor of Pravda. Soviet journalists said that at the closed-door session Friday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> tore into some of the stars of the glasnost-era media. He reportedly called specifically for the resignation of the editor of the country's most popular newspaper, the weekly Arguments and Facts, for acting against the party and seeking his political downfall. The demand triggered a move in the Supreme Soviet legislature and among the newspaper's workers to defend the editor. The source characterized the attack on the outspoken practitioners of glasnost as a gesture to party conservatives while his real goal was to gain control of Pravda.

<HEAD>Diplomats Warned To Wear I.D. Passes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Diplomats and thousands of others who work at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> risk `` adverse administration action'' if they fail to wear identification passes on chains around their necks or in other ways visible to newly hired guards. A recent notice did not specify what punishment might be meted out to violators, but warned `` keeping the pass in a pocket or purse or hanging from a belt does not constitute proper wearing of the pass.'' The guards, who recently replaced other private guards, are posted at all building entrances and regularly patrol hallways. They are dressed in police-like uniforms and carry walkie-talkies which blare out instructions. As in the past, employees will move through turnstiles to enter or leave the building. Passes are inserted in the turnstiles while guards stand watch. The notice said the purpose of the mandatory pass policy is to `` ensure that there are no unauthorized individuals on the premises and thus ensure the safety of employees and the protection of government property.'' Employees who do not display their passes after Nov. 1 will be asked to return to their office accompanied by guards to verify they are valid pass holders, the notice said. `` As with other violations of department security procedures, instances of continued non-compliance by employees may result in adverse administration action being recommended,'' the notice said. The 350-word notice told workers they could pick up neck chains and clasps for the passes at guard posts.

 Spanish Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met today and discussed what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called `` the unique role'' <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> can play in furthering democracy in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Both leaders hailed the 90-minutes of talks as a reaffirmation of close ties between the two nations. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> also extended to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> an official invitation from King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> to visit <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said they reviewed Western efforts to bolster the economies of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, communist states struggling to enact political and economic reforms. `` <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s successful transition to strong and flourishing democracy makes it a powerful model for Eastern European countries now attempting similar transformations,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in departure remarks. `` In supporting democratic change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and elsewhere, I am convinced that <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> can play a unique role, for <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> provides the world with a very special example,'' he said. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, speaking in Spanish, said that in reviewing the international situation, including arms control, `` we agreed that the prospects today are encouraging.'' `` We also underlined the importance of making the greatest possible effort in disarmament and arms control talks,'' he said. He also expressed sorrow for the victims of Tuesday's earthquake in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> was thought to be carrying fresh proposals for bringing about an elected government in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> while allowing Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to remain in the country. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to relinquish power and stand trial here on drug trafficking charges. American officials said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> did not discuss <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in their initial talks, but it was expected to come up tonight in their discussion at a private dinner at the White House. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> believes a solution might be possible if the focus on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> shifts away from <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s personal fate and emphasizes instead the transfer of power to an elected government. His visit took place 16 days after the failed coup attempt against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> by dissident elements of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. The administration has been searching for new ideas on how to deal with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and officials said they were eager to listen to <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>. The official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said there were some areas of agreement and of disagreement with <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s proposal. `` The point of agreement is that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ought to get out. What happens after that _ we have a point of view, and perhaps the prime minister's got a different point of view, and we'll hear it when he's here,'' the official said. Meanwhile, a published report said the newly appointed top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military commander in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has requested the evacuation of most dependents of American servicemen stationed there. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times reported in today's editions that unnamed sources in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> say Gen. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> raised the subject with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> earlier this week at a White House dinner. The sources told the newspaper <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> made the proposal to evacuate some 3,500 dependents of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to heighten the sense of war among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. The Times said the request is being studied by Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>. White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today the administration is considering whether to accelerate its plan, ongoing since spring, to get all federally employed civilians and military dependents either relocated to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases or home to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He said that as of July 1, 6,300 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees and dependents had either been sent home or relocated on the bases. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population break down in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, he said, is 12,500 military personnel, 2,700 <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> civilians and 11,000 dependents. Under <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s proposal, outlined to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> reporters in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> in recent days, a newly elected president in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> would have the power to name a new military commander to replace <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who would have the option to remain in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has held out hope <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could be extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to face drug smuggling charges. He has given no serious consideration to determining whether it would be legally possible to drop the charges in the interest of promoting democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Campaign Gains Reprieve for Egypt's Largest Colony of Egrets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GIZA, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nature lovers defending the country's largest colony of rare egrets persuaded officials to halt an assault on nesting trees to keep bird droppings from coating parked cars. From the birds' point of view, the victory came in the nick of time: 11 of the huge trees had been ruined, scores of the majestic birds have died and hundreds of others fled to safer environs. For more than a century, thousands of egrets have made their homes in 99 tall eucalyptuses beside <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> Zoo and along <LOCATION> Sharia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, a main boulevard in this <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> suburb. Protected by law as an endangered species, the snow-white birds became a familiar sight. They flew at dawn to distant fields down the Nile, where they helped farmers control insects, then returned to their nests as the sun sank over the pyramids in the distance. Just as familiar in recent decades have been the cars parked along <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, usually splattered with bird droppings. This summer, owners of luxury apartments overlooking the zoo complained to authorities about the droppings and demanded action. At midnight Oct. 9, the government sent dozens of men with bulldozers and chain saws. They spent the rest of the night obliterating the foliage of the first three trees. Inadvertantly, they also destroyed parts of the zoo's antique iron wall and flattened an empty bus stop. `` They made preparations as if it was a war,'' said <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Amer </PERSON>, the zoo official in charge of birds and animals and one of several activists who stopped the anti-egret campaign. It took two days for telegrams and phone calls to senior officials and police to halt the massacre. By then, 11 eucalyptus evergreens had lost all their branches, as many as 200 egrets were dead, and about 2,000 others fled into the zoo seeking shelter. `` It's not just the issue of 11 butchered trees. It's harmful to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s reputation,'' <PERSON> Amer </PERSON> said. `` It was awful _ children running after the birds, the stray cats eating the small, helpless chicks in their nests. It was terrible,'' he said. Amer estimated 5,000 pairs of egrets live on the 1 \ - mile stretch of But <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahaa </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Din </PERSON>, a zoo employee from <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, said a 1987 survey counted 1,604 pairs. Mrs. <PERSON> Bahaa </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Din </PERSON>, associated with the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bird </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION>, said because the egrets' breeding period was unfinished, most of the chicks were too small to fly to safety. `` The first day I saw the damage, I thought a tornado or hurricane had hit. At least 100 baby egrets were killed,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Bahaa </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Din </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION>'s governor, <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Akher </PERSON>, insisted that the governorate had broken no law. `` We have n't killed any birds,'' she said <PERSON> Abdel-Akher </PERSON> told her. `` The law bans hunting birds, and we did n't do that.'' On Tuesday, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION> reported that Environment Minister <PERSON> Atef </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebeid </PERSON> had ordered Abdel-Akher to stop the `` cleaning-up campaign.'' Egrets, tall and thin, boast long white plumes, spindly legs and elongated, slender bills. They have lived in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> for thousands of years, depicted on walls of ancient tombs. Although hundreds of thousands once filled <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> fields, they came close to extinction at the turn of the century as plume hunters shot them down to obtain feathers for hats. A 1912 law declared egrets a protected species and their colonies rejuvenated, but farmers using pesticides killed many of them. The 99 eucalyptus trees were planted in 1954 alongside trees where the free-ranging cattle egrets first nested. `` The governorate's report says that the tree branches were being removed because they were old, dying and diseased,'' said <PERSON> Amer </PERSON>. `` These eucalyptus trees live for up to 450 years, and they are certainly not diseased.'' Another governorate administration about 10 years ago tried to trim the eucalyptus branches to get rid of the egrets, but a public uproar ended it. Despite the temporary pro-bird victory, Mrs. <PERSON> Bahaa </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Din </PERSON> said she expects the governorate to insist on moving the colony, but in a more scientific way, so as not to harm the birds, and without dismembering the trees. A <ORGANIZATION> Cairo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor, who passes the zoo every day, waxed lyrical when asked about the assault on the trees and the birds: `` One day it was like a beautiful woman whose hair was flowing in the breeze. Yesterday, it was like somebody had shaved her head.''

 <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s experience should be a warning to Midwesterners to strengthen buildings and plan for temblors on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fault </ORGANIZATION>, which has spawned some of the strongest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> quakes, experts say. The quake that rattled the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area on Tuesday `` has about a 1-in-3 probability of happening on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fault </ORGANIZATION> in the next 10 years,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of the Center for Earthquake Studies in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Girardeau </LOCATION>. `` We can watch what's happening out there and take a lot of notes `` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> is the best prepared city for an earthquake in the world. What <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> has been doing for a long time is going to pay off.'' The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> quake, measuring 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, has been blamed for an estimated 270 deaths and hundreds of injuries as well as more than $ 1 billion in damage to property, bridges, highways and rail lines. The earthquake that devastated Soviet <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> last December also had a 6.9 Richter reading, but killed 25,000 people and did $ 16 billion in damage. `` <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> was an example of absolutely no preparation,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. `` We're not as bad off as <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, but we're certainly not anywhere near as well prepared as <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> was.'' Quakes are much less frequent on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fault </ORGANIZATION>, which runs from Marked Tree, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, into southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, but scientists say there is a 40 percent to 63 percent chance of a 6.3 quake by the year 2000. `` The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> Fault is probably the most dangerous fault in the eastern half of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but there is far more danger of an earthquake on the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fault </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiens </PERSON>, assistant professor of earth and planetary sciences at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` But that's not to say that there's not danger. Just less.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fault </ORGANIZATION> has minor earthquakes registering 3 to 4 `` almost daily,'' but the last one above 6.0 was in 1985, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, chairman of the department of earth and atmospheric sciences at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. In the summer of 1987, a quake of 4.9 hit along the southern Illinois-Indiana border, causing minor damage. A series of temblors that ripped through the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> zone in 1811 and 1812 could be felt in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> but occurred in a largely unpopulated area and the number of deaths is unknown. There was no equipment to measure earthquakes in the 1800s, but scientists say the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> quakes would probably have been up to 8.7. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake of 1906 is estimated at 8.3. The 1985 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> quake that killed 10,000 measured 8.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s foreign minister held what he called friendly and constructive talks Thursday with the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the group that has fought South African rule of the territory for 23 years. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, on a one-day visit to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, met with <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> and the other nine parties competing in pre-independence elections planned for Nov. 7-11. No date has been set for independence, but it is expected early next year. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said the United Nations-supervised independence process was on track, but technical matters still needed to be worked out. He cited <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s currency, telecommunications system, and its participation in a customs union for southern African nations. Asked about his meeting with <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> leaders, including its President <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said it was `` friendly, and I would go so far as to say constructive.'' He said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would accept the results of a `` free and fair election'' and `` was not interested in the ideology or color of the future government.'' <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was falsely accusing the guerrilla movement of detaining dissidents and deploying combatants in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> said there was no evidence to support either claim. The left-leaning organization also accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> of taking inadequate steps to demobilize <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION>, a police counterinsurgency unit active during the guerrillas' independence war. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team that visited <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> said they found no evidence that <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> was still holding prisoners, but they could not account for 315 people. A group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> human rights lawyers, the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, last week called for a full accounting of the missing detainees. Relatives of missing people have taken <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> to court, trying to get details on all people held by the organization outside <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since 1980. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> said the case is an attempt to embarrass the organization before the elections. The elections are for an assembly that will draft a constitution for independent <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, which has about 1.3 million people. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> independence plan stipulates that a two-thirds majority within the assembly would be required for adoption of a constitution. But one of the minor parties, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> may be trying to remove the two-thirds requirement because it fears it wo n't win such a high percentage. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said the head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring force in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>, supported the two-thirds requirement. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> will have 1,395 poll watchers monitoring the elections. Another 500 police supervisors are expected soon, which would raise the force to 1,500. The U.N. Transition Assistance Group in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> also consists of 4,650 peacekeepers, and more than 1,500 civilians. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which has ruled the territory since World War I, signed accords in December with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> agreeing to independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> if 50,000 Cuban troops stationed in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> are sent home by mid-1991.

 A black political group charged in a lawsuit that <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>'s mayor and the county's chief judge conspired to set high bail to silence activists during a disturbance.

<HEAD>Earthquake Theories Have Abounded Through History</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 While modern science provides better answers to why earthquakes occur, the human response to these disasters differs little from that of centuries past. `` Praying to God'' was prominent among the answers set forth by the writer <PERSON> Galesius </PERSON> following tremors in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in 1570, and that was surely the response of many Californians on Tuesday and since that tremor. <PERSON> Galesius </PERSON> also urged `` coming outside during an earthquake,'' which remains good advice, and `` bearing patiently the troubles that could not be avoided.'' Two other recommendations from his pen covered strengthening of buildings to better resist future quakes, though modern building materials and practices differ from what he had available. His final suggestion was placing statues of Saturn and Mercury at the four corners of buildings. <PERSON> Galesius </PERSON> researched quakes that shook the regions around <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pozzuoli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON>, producing a book that enumerated different types of shaking and suggested that earthquakes were portents of even more disasters in the future. In his book, <PERSON> Galesius </PERSON> listed the many theories of why earthquakes occur, including the then-popular concept that they resulted from `` exhalations'' from inside the Earth. Today, scientists describe the movement of giant plates deep in the earth, with quakes occurring most often along the borders of those plates where the rocks bind together for a time and then suddenly slip past one another when the stress becomes strong enough. Ancient scientists and philosophers, however, produced many theories in an effort to explain the shaking of the ground beneath their feet. They were able to record the quakes over thousands of years, and observed that tremors were more common in some areas than others. One of the earliest theories was produced by the Greek writer <ORGANIZATION> Thales </ORGANIZATION> who lived at about 580 B.C. He conceived the Earth as a great vessel floating on the oceans, and thought that movement of the water caused earthquakes. Competing theories were produced by <PERSON> Anaximenes </PERSON>, who thought giant rocks colliding in the earth's interior caused the temblors. Writing between 500 and 428 B.C., <PERSON> Anaxagoras </PERSON> contended that fire caused earthquakes. He thought that caverns beneath the land were filled with vapors and when the vapors collided, lightning-like fire was produced, shaking the land above. The theory was similar to the one common then that lightning in the air was produced when clouds collided. Also in the fifth century B.C. <PERSON> Archelaus </PERSON> theorized that air became compressed in underground caverns and eventually the pressure caused quakes. Perhaps the most important of classical writers on earthquakes was <PERSON> Seneca </PERSON>, who lived from 4 B.C., to 65 A.D. He believed that the interior of the earth was filled with cold, clammy air which caused the quakes. That theory was repeated by many later writers including <PERSON> Konrad </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Megenberg </PERSON> in the 1300s, who added the possibility that the stars stirred up these vapors. He also believed that the earthly vapors caused the Black Plague then sweeping <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The Venerable Bede, writing in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> about 700 A.D., contended that earthquakes were caused by a large sea beast in the ocean with its tail wrapped around the world. Similar beast theories have abounded in other cultures. In the 15th century, the writers Agricola and <PERSON> Cardan </PERSON> expounded on the theory of fires within the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, with <PERSON> Cardan </PERSON> emphasizing the possibility of sulfur and niter causing explosions beneath the land. That theory remained popular for many years, with <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemery </PERSON> contending in the 18th century that the reaction of iron and sulfur was responsible not only for earthquakes but also volcanoes and thunderstorms. As science began to learn more about nature, electricity became a possible candidate, with <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Delametherie </PERSON> comparing the earth's crust to the muscles of a fish reacting to the shock of an electric eel. By the 19th century, scientists were learning more about quakes with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> discovering the movement of waves through the Earth's surface and <PERSON> Domenico </PERSON> <PERSON> Pignatoro </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> devising an early scale of intensity for quakes.

 A man who spent 6 -LCB- years in prison for a murder and robbery he did not commit has been awarded $ 1.9 million in damages by a state Court of Claims. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, 30, was awarded $ 1.5 million Wednesday for `` loss of liberty, mental stress, anguish and loss of reputation,'' by Judge <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON>, settling a lawsuit that was filed three years ago. <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> also ordered the state to pay the former <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> resident $ 225,000 in medical expenses, noting that his prison experience had contributed to a dependency on drugs and alcohol that required hospital treatment. With amounts awarded for lost of past and future earnings, the total award was $ 1,935,000, a record in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for damages in a case of unlawful conviction, said civil rights lawyer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Emery </PERSON>, who represented <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> had sought $ 20 million. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> was convicted in 1979 and sentenced to 15 years for taking part in an armed robbery of 15 people, one of whom was killed for resisting.

<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ethiopian President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON>, in a defiant response to rebel victories that analysts say could threaten his government, has called on his nation to unite and defeat the insurgents. In a rare, hour-long speech broadcast nationwide Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> accused the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Tigre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of rejecting peace overtures and of being `` bent on creating an immense act of fratricidal war.'' He said the insurgents also had joined in a `` sinister conspiracy'' to facilitate the secession of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s northernmost province, <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, which has been the aim of another rebel group. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> said it was for the people to decide whether to allow <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> to secede through the `` machinations'' of the <ORGANIZATION> TPLF </ORGANIZATION>, or to `` defuse the vile conspiracy by mobilizing all the available resources and score a decisive victory.'' `` We await the decision of the people,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> said. Since August, the <ORGANIZATION> TPLF </ORGANIZATION> is reported to have scored a string of victories, pushing government troops out of the rebels' Tigre province south into the heart of neighboring <LOCATION> Wollo </LOCATION> province and to within 155 miles of the capital, <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. Diplomats say the offensive presents a strong challenge to <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION>'s Marxist government, weakened by a bloody attempted coup in May, waning Soviet support and one of the world's poorest economies. The rebels' southern progress appeared to have included the taking of Dese, <LOCATION> Wollo </LOCATION>'s regional capital, over the weekend, with government troops and bureaucrats fleeing without a shot being fired. But Western diplomats said the rebels did not occupy the key city and that, backed by hundreds of reinforcements, government troops and personnel started returning to Dese on Tuesday and Wednesday. Foreign aid agencies have pulled a dozen or so expatriate relief workers from Dese back to <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, apparently indefinitely, as they monitor the military situation, said the diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The diplomats said there appeared to be a lull in the fighting with the rebels hiding in the hills around Dese and the government using the time to bring in reinforcements from the Eritrean capital of <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION>. One of <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION>'s problems in slowing the rebels' advance has been his demoralized army, observers said. After decades of fighting, the force is principally made up of poorly paid young conscripts with little training. `` I think above all what <LOCATION> Mengistu </LOCATION> needs in <LOCATION> Dese </LOCATION> is quality _ some trained troops who have proven their ability and their loyalty,'' said one of the diplomats, who described the forces from <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION> as just that. They were instrumental in putting down a May coup attempt that saw more than a dozen generals slain and more than 100 other senior officers jailed. <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> characterized the rebels as `` treacherous bandits'' who were `` biting our hand stretched out in peace.'' In June, <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> offered to engage in unconditional peace negotatiations in the presence of an international observer with the rebel groups, and the first round of peace talks between the government and the Eritreans took place last month in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. A second round of talks is scheduled to begin Nov. 18 in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> TPLF </ORGANIZATION> in July and August broadcast statements indicating it was willing to engage in negotiations and Tuesday said it had agreed on the `` basic idea'' of holding peace talks after a monthlong series of meetings in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> with government representatives. Diplomats, however, who spoke by telephone from <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s capital, were wary of the rebels' statement `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> TPLF </ORGANIZATION> is engaged in a strategy to build wedges and cracks in this government,'' said one. `` Any talks should be seen in this light.'' The <ORGANIZATION> TPLF </ORGANIZATION> took up arms in 1974 seeking greater autonomy for the province of Tigre and <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION>'s ouster. The secessionist Eritrean rebels have been fighting since 1962 in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s oldest civil war.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> briefed President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today on the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake and declared the federal government would `` put the maximum that we can'' behind the relief effort. But members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said the emergency funds would fall short of what was needed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would fly to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area Friday for a personal inspection of the damage. White House officials said the president would spend about three hours in the area. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> were in the quake area on Wednesday and told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> what they had seen and how federal relief efforts were progressing. `` All federal resources have been marshaled,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said in an appearance on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' program. `` The coordination in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is excellent. I spoke to the governor and all his requests are being met.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> `` Today'' show if there was enough money available for the relief effort. He replied, `` We will put the maximum that we can behind that, working with state and local levels of government to clean the situation up.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> brushed off criticism from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> who said he was `` ticked off'' that the vice president did not meet with him during his tour of the area. `` We invited all the mayors to come and sit down with us,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` I think it's very unfortunate to take that kind of a shot at a very difficult time.'' <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, a Democrat, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` flies around in a helicopter, makes a bunch of television spots. ... I have real questions about what he was doing here. It may have been just a publicity stunt.'' White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today that not only was <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> invited to two meetings <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> held, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> offered to `` send a helicopter to pick him up wherever he was and deliver him to the meetings, and he declined that.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, has tried to call Agnos for several days, and `` he declined to talk to us. We regret very muth that the mayor of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> has declined not to cooperate with us in this matter in making sure there is adequate federal support for the disaster in his city.'' The White House said an initial $ 273 million will be available for the area from a pool of $ 1.1 billion that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appropriated after the devastation caused by Hurricane Hugo. But Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said $ 1.1 billion is n't enough The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will have to cooperate to find more money, he said. `` I want to do whatever it would take to make those dollars available,'' he said. `` No question we would want to take them -LRB- funds -RRB- out of existing programs.'' The day after Tuesday's earthquake, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visited the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the office responsible for coordinating 25 departments brought in to handle the disaster. `` Words ca n't adequately convey our sentiments, I know, but I can say that we will take every step and make every effort to help the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area in its hours of need,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he discussed the importance of preparation with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by telephone from <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two on his way back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from inspecting the damage in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` It could have been much worse if we had not had that preparation,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I do believe it's under control and we are making progress.'' Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, meantime, activated military support. Military hospitals opened their doors to civilians, and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> moved people and equipment into the area. Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said 1,173 <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> have been called up to help in quake recovery operations, but he could now say how many active duty military personnel have helped, since most of their efforts have been `` so impromptu and ad hoc.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> has begun inspecting federal dams and levees and, at the request of the state government, state and private dams. So far, he said, no damage has been reported for structures inspected within 50 miles of the epicenter. Also, a U-2 reconnaissance plane from <ORGANIZATION> Beale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> overflew the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area late Wednesday and <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> will be given the pictures. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the photos could be used to detect problems in structures. Two hundred <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Seabees, specialists in disaster recovery, headed to the area equipped with backhoes, trench diggers and water storage equipment to repair water and sewer lines. Heavy lift equipment from the <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was sent to remove debris from a collapsed section of Interstate 880 in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, where some 250 people were feared dead.

The smaller offices may begin operating in a few days. Federal assistance can include temporary housing, grants of up to $ 10,000 per family and low-cost loans to cover uninsured private and business property losses. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> operated temporary shelters for people left homeless by the earthquake. Even the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> came to the aid of residents, volunteering to forgive penalties on late tax returns or payments.

 The tale of Oscar the fish, <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s earthquake prophet, took another curious turn this week: The one-eyed denizen of the deep was sequestered due to death threats. Four hours after Tuesday's <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area quake, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> was doing the sidestroke _ the same pre-temblor behavior that brought the 10-inch fish notoriety as a quake prognosticator. Oscar may have been swimming on his side moments before the Bay area quake, but no one was around to see. Observers insist the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> red oscar, which usually lives in an aquarium in <LOCATION> Corona </LOCATION> del <ORGANIZATION> Mar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s biology lab, has rolled over and predicted 15 to 20 Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> quakes in three years. But recent publicity surrounding his talents spawned a series of death threats. Fearing Oscar might be `` deep-sixed,'' Principal <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> said the famous fish was taken to an undisclosed location two weeks ago. So <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> was alone during Tuesday's 6.9-magnitude quake, said biology teacher <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnitger </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Schnitger </PERSON> visited the fish hours later, he saw another unusual occurrence. `` He was sleeping on his side, and I've never seen that happen, sleeping with his good eye down,'' said <PERSON> Schnitger </PERSON>, explaining fish usually sleep the same way they swim.

 More than half of the students at <ORGANIZATION> Metamora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> students are boycotting the lunch program because the school board decided to offer only a pro-nutrition, no `` junk food'' menu. The rebellion is hitting the school financially. And the students are getting backing from a local radio station and a major corporation _ which is offering free Twinkies. Particularly rankling to students has been the administration's recent ban on the sale of soda and candy during lunch at the Student Council Store That has put a significant dent in the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s fund raising, cutting projected annual revenue from $ 35,000 to $ 6,000. Protesting students have been bringing bag lunches for over a week instead of paying $ 1.25 for the school's hot lunch. Business has dropped in the cafeteria from 550 students daily to about 250. `` Students are old enough to choose what they want to eat,'' said Student Council President <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a proud brown bagger. `` We just want to get the candy and sodas back,'' said <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohman </PERSON>, the unofficial leader of the rebellion, who also lobbied for _ and won _ a salad bar and milk shake machine for the cafeteria last year. `` Kids get addicted to it, almost.''

 The conservative editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda, the country's most authoritative newspaper that has lagged behind glasnost, was removed Thursday and replaced by a confidant of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. It was the most dramatic development in a week of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> wrangling about the state-run press that focused new attention on the information explosion spawned by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or greater openness. The departure of Pravda chief editor <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>, announced by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> and state-run TV, also marks a further attempt by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to clean house of conservatives in high positions. Last month, three conservatives on the ruling Politburo were retired. The Pravda editorship is seen as an important position. <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> was allowed to sit in on closed meetings of the Politburo and is a member of the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ideological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>, who has headed the party newspaper since the era of former Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> _ now condemned as a period of stagnation _ would be moving to `` scientific work.'' It said said <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>'s replacement is <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>, a philosopher and former editor of the party's theoretical monthly journal <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON>, who has been an adviser to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for the last year. A well-placed source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the move would give <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his reformist allies control of Pravda. Pravda, which means `` truth'' and blares the Marxist appeal `` Workers of the World, Unite!'' atop page one, is still the place to seek texts of official speeches and articles about <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> policy. But its circulation, now 9.6 million, is falling as it lags behind other newspapers championing franker coverage of national and international affairs. Many Soviets turn instead to publications such as Arguments and Facts and <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION>, which are filled with breezily written criticisms of the system. The Arguments and Facts weekly has a circulation of 26 million, more than double last year's figure, and is the country's most popular newspaper. Pravda last month suffered an embarrassment when it reprinted an Italian newspaper's article claiming popular Communist maverick <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> boozed and shopped his way through the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during a recent speaking tour. A few days later, Pravda apologized, saying the story could not be substantiated. Afansyev aide <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Popov </PERSON> said <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>'s replacement will be announced in Friday's editions of Pravda. `` Tomorrow you'll read all, that he's going to the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Popov </PERSON> said in an interview. The replacement of <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>, 66, followed a special party meeting on the press that appeared to be aimed at reformers rather than conservatives like the Pravda editor. Soviet journalists said that at the closed-door session Friday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> tore into some of the stars of glasnost. The Kremlin chief reportedly called specifically for the resignation of the editor of Arguments and Facts, <PERSON> Vladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starkov </PERSON>. Soviet lawmakers, the weekly newspaper's workers and an international organization, The <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Protect Journalists, rallied to defend the editor. In an interpretation of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s tactics, the well-placed source characterized the attack on the outspoken practitioners of glasnost as a gesture to party conservatives, while the real goal was to gain control of Pravda. Another Soviet observer said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was taking a middle course by trying to get rid of one editor who has angered conservatives and another widely viewed as an obstacle to reform. On Thursday, members of <PERSON> Starkov </PERSON>'s staff said they had formed a work committee and elected him head in a bid to protect him from being fired. The staff members, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the publisher of Arguments and Facts, the Znaniye public lecture society, also supports <PERSON> Starkov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> has been Pravda editor since 1976. In addition to his party posts is head of the official <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION>. Although he has spoken out for glasnost, <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> is closely identified with the <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> era, when the press helped hide the country's problems He favors keeping government processes under strong party supervision, rejects political pluralism and has warned against allowing criticism of party policy to go too far. Last summer, a deputy to a nationwide party conference listed <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> as among four top officials who `` actively pursued the policy of stagnation'' and should be fired. Of the others _ <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON> _ only <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> think tank on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, still has his job. <PERSON> Popov </PERSON> said <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> has wanted for some time to devote his attention more fully to the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, where he is a member of the section on philosophy and law, and asked to leave Pravda. <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>, 60, headed <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s theoretical and political journal, until 1987 and is credited with formulating <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s foreign policy that places priority on fostering values common to all mankind, rather than encouraging class struggle Like <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> is a full member of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Ideological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>' Philosophy and Law department.

<TEXT>
 About 8 million poor children are being shut out of Medicaid, threatening their health and leaving them vulnerable to chronic and disabling conditions later in life, a children's hospital association said Thursday. `` Skimping on Medicaid for children is shortsighted public policy,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> and Related Institutions. Medical care denied poor children now can result in larger expenses in later years when they need treatment for illnesses and conditions that could have been prevented with proper care in the early years, he said. But a report released by the association said poor children are being forgotten as state governments balance their budgets by chipping away at Medicaid benefits and tightening eligibility to limit enrollment in their programs. The result, the report said, is that nearly half of the nation's children living under the federal poverty level are not served by the federal-state health-care program for the poor `` Why must children be the ones excluded in this spasm of fiscal integrity?'' asked <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>. `` They'll be paying off this deficit for years to come _ should n't they get some of the benefits, now, to ensure that they're healthy enough to suport this responsibility?'' <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vice </PERSON>, chairman of the association and president of <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` after 25 years of public neglect, Medicaid is nothing short of Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>'s poor stepchild.'' The association called for reforms that would ensure coverage for all children and pregnant women to 185 percent of the federal poverty level, allow those with higher incomes to buy into Medicaid and expand benefits for eligible children. The group also said physician reimbursements should be raised to ensure that beneficiaries have access to care and enrollment procedures should be eased. The changes would cost the federal government and the states $ 10 billion and would add coverage for 7.5 million of the nation's estimated 11 million uninsured children In fiscal 1988, the federal government spent $ 30 billion and the states spent $ 20 billion on Medicaid. The report said Medicaid coverage is denied to an estimated 8 million poor children. Income limits vary from state to state. This year, an average income of $ 407 per month _ about 48 percent of the federal poverty level _ disqualifies a family of three from Medicaid, the report said. In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, the limit for a family of three is $ 118 per month. Ten states deny Medicaid coverage to children who live with two parents, regardless of income. Many children who are eligible do n't receive benefits because parents are unable to complete the complicated application and documentation forms, the report said.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Say U.S. Blocking Antarctica Meeting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Environmentalists on Thursday accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of leading an assault that has blocked agreement at an international meeting on the future of <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> and hopes of protecting the icy continent. Dominating debate at the two-week meeting of 39 nations that ends Friday is the issue of mining: whether the vast continent should be left a beautiful unspoiled wilderness or exploited for its potential mineral wealths. French oceanographer and explorer <PERSON> Jacques-Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON>, who collected 1.5 million signatures on a petition favoring an Antarctic wilderness preserve, accused <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> officials of `` wasting their time defending a lost cause.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> want a meeting to work out details of accident liability under an international minerals convention that would open <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> to regulated mining and replace the existing voluntary moratorium on mining. The convention, worked out after six years of tough negotiation, was initialed in June 1988 in <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the convention is the best way to protect <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, and a member of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation who spoke on condition of anonymity said negotiations were proceeding smoothly. `` Nobody here wants to go home without an agreement,'' he said. But <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> say mining and environmental protection are like oil and icy waters _ they do n't mix. Both countries have refused to sign the mineral convention, effectively stopping it, and they have been joined in the last few weeks by <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> want a meeting dedicated to discussing an ambitious proposal to declare <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> a `` wilderness park'' where mining would be prohibited and human activity carefully controlled. `` The meeting has made very little progress since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> and a couple of others had refused to stop pushing the minerals convention,'' said an environmentalist with observer status to the conference. `` We could end up without any agreement at all. It would be tragic.'' The minerals convention does not assign responsiblity for cleaning up and paying damages in the event of accident. The Argentine ship <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION> ran around and sank near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> in January, spilling 70,000 gallons of diesel fuel into one of the most delicate ecosystems in the world. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cooperated on the cleanup, but the ship continues to leak. To date, no one has assumed responsiblity for plugging the leak, or for the damage done to 22 years of American research measuring <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>'s unpolluted environment against global pollution levels. Delegates at the 15th <ORGANIZATION> Antarctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meeting </ORGANIZATION> also were busy hammering out compromises on rules governing waste disposal and specially protected areas.

 Despite dramatic rescues, authorities had little hope today that more survivors could be extricated from between massive slabs of concrete sandwiched together on Interstate 880. An army of construction workers maneuvered cranes around the fallen, 18-block section of the elevated double-decker freeway while rescuers used dogs and electronic sensors to search for signs of life. Wood-and-pipe supports were placed under rubble along a portion of the collapsed freeway so workers could safely map the locations and conditions of smashed cars, police Sgt. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said today. It will take several days to place hundreds of supports, and the mapping ca n't be completed until then. As darkness fell Wednesday, police Capt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said no one had been recovered during the day and he doubted there were more survivors. More than 250 rush-hour commuters were feared crushed to death between the decks of I-880, the <ORGANIZATION> Nimitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freeway </ORGANIZATION>, which collapsed during Tuesday's quake. The search was moving `` slowly and meticulously'' because the highway was like `` a house of cards'' that could flatten at any moment, said <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was telling reporters Wednesday evening that the search had found no survivors when police Lt. <PERSON> Kristina </PERSON> <PERSON> Wraa </PERSON> interrupted to say one had been discovered. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> later dismissed the report as garbled communication. Tuesday night, rescuers were able to pull one man alive from a car crushed to a height of 18 inches, said passerby <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> MacIntyre </PERSON>, and emergency workers pulled a girl from the wreckage of another automobile. In perhaps the most dramatic, ghastly rescue, doctors freed a 6-year-old from a car after firefighters cut through the body of the child's dead mother. Dr. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Betts </PERSON>, lying on his stomach in the car crushed between the decks, was forced to amputate the boy's right leg, while firefighters struggled to contain blazes that consumed vehicles on either side of the car. `` It was appalling. It was terrible,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, one of two other surgeons working with <PERSON> Betts </PERSON>. `` We're used to having them brought to the hospital, not doing surgery under a concrete beam.'' The child, <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Berumen </PERSON>, was in critical condition Wednesday at Children's Hospital. The child's mother and another adult in the car were killed when a pillar of the highway sliced through the vehicle during the temblor, said fire Capt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> speculated the highway collapse was the result of substandard construction. He called for an investigation. State transportation officials said the freeway, one of the area's oldest, had been reinforced and was considered earthquake-safe Some years back bumper stickers reading, `` Pray for Me, I Drive the Nimitz,'' appeared in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, but were presumed to deal more with the highway's narrow lanes and concrete barriers than the threat of earthquake damage. During Tuesday evening's rush hour, screams and the crash of metal brought residents of the surrounding neighborhood in impoverished <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> to the scene. `` They climbed up on the bridge to take people off. They lined up to volunteer. They established medical help as soon as possible,'' Police Lt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eade </PERSON> said. `` I did n't see one instance of a citizen that did n't cooperate.'' <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> said she was driving on the lower deck when the quake hit. `` Suddenly the road started to bounce,'' she said. `` The cars were like ping pong balls. They were bouncing.'' I-880 was built in 1957 and was reinforced in 1977 in the first part of a three-phase anti-earthquake program, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> officials said. In the work, the road deck was tied to its supporting columns. The columns themselves collapsed, and the deck did not slip off the columns, transportation department chief engineer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. Further work to strengthen the road against earthquakes had been deferred pending an engineering study, <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said. Asked whether the freeway had been considered safe from earthquakes, <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said, `` there's no such thing as an earthquake-proof structure,'' but added he was shocked by the collapse. `` We thought it would withstand the maximum credible earthquake we could have in this area, anything that would happen in this area,'' he told reporters.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of Commerce <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said Thursday that Soviet bloc nations must boldly commit themselves to free market economies if they want to solve their dire financial problems. `` Our hope is to see the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and all the countries of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> fully integrated into the community of nations, with their citizens enjoying the benefits of free enterprise,'' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> for a conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. His remarks came in a speech prepared for delivery Thursday evening. The commerce secretary said that much work is necessary before <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc nations that strengthen their economies. `` There is no escaping the fact that the East's economic problems were home-grown, and they can only be solved at home by radical _ and genuine change,'' he said. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> added: `` Only the market place, only free enterprise, can solve the desperate economic problems of the Eastern countries.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration official said the leaders of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> are committed to working for a market economy, while `` each day Soviet leaders come closer. `` The leaders of the other Eastern economies, though, are still living in the past,'' he asserted. Communist East German leaders, including new party chief <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, have called for a strengthening of an orthodox socialist structure. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has an economy that is the envy of many of its Soviet bloc neighbors. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> also addressed the critical question of financing changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Competition in production alone is not enough,'' he said. `` Independent banks are essential, allocating capital on the basis of markets and interest rates and offering financial services that we in the West take for granted.'' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, 62, also referred to his own background as a multimillionaire oil company executive. `` As a businessman, I'm not accustomed to couching my views in the language of euphemism. I prefer to speak forthrightly,'' said <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>. `` And I'll say what we all know: Marxist economics do not work.'' Among the topics at the <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> security conference <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> was attending is the integration of the `` reforming socialist countries into the world economy.'' Other topics include arms reduction and international cooperation. West German Foreign Minister-Hans <PERSON> Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> and Italian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gianni </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelis </PERSON> were among the approximately 200 participants.

<HEAD>Regulators Deny Request to Delay Low-Power License</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Thursday turned down a citizen group's request to delay issuing a low-power testing license for the Comanche Peak nuclear power plant in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The request by Citizens for Fair Utility Regulation came just days after the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> opened an internal investigation into allegations by an anonymous group of <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> inspectors that senior agency officials had covered up problems at Comanche Peak. The anonymous inspectors, in a letter to commission Chairman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> on Oct. 4, said <PERSON> Comanche </PERSON> <PERSON> Peak </PERSON>, operated by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was far from being ready to safely begin low-power testing. The commission has not said when it would issue a low-power license, but staff members indicated Thursday it would be at least a few weeks. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Brink </PERSON>, a leader of the citizens group, said that as a result of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to put Comanche Peak's low-power license application on hold her organization would go to the 5th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> next week. The plant is situated near <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, about 40 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. The group's main argument is that Comanche Peak should not be allowed to fire up the reactor until the courts rule on the group's existing suit seeking to force a licensing rehearing The hearing process was officially closed in July 1988. Mrs. <PERSON> Brink </PERSON> said her group believed that the plant was not ready to operate safely and that even low-power operation would put area residents at undue risk. In denying the group's request, the commission said it was a matter for the courts to decide because the commission previously had ruled that the group had no legal standing to intervene in the late stages of the licensing hearings. The commission added, however, that it was ordering its staff to look into the group's charges of possible safety hazards associated with low-power operation of the plant. The owner of <ORGANIZATION> Comanche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peak </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, told the commission Thursday it expected to be ready to request permission to load fuel and start low-power testing early next month, although it gave no exact target date. <PERSON> Erle </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON>, chairman of the utility, said, `` I am confident that Comanche Peak has been built safely.''

<HEAD>Study: Decade of Effort Brings $450 Million in Pay Equity Adjustments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A decade of lobbying for pay equity has brought women and minorities in the public sector more than $ 450 million in wage and salary gains, according to a survey released Thursday. The prospects for achieving further pay increases for women and minorities in the 1990s are bright, the study and its sponsors said, because of the attention focused on the issue and because those groups will represent the majority of new entrants in the job market. `` What the 1980s have done is establish pay equity as a viable way to end wage discrimination,'' said <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equity </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have made inroads and now in the 1990s we will move forward by focusing on grass-roots education, legislation, litigation, collective bargaining and other means of making additional progress.'' The committee's study, a compilation of the results of state and local pay-equity drives since 1979, found that all but five states have studied whether their pay scales are fair to women. Also launching such studies were scores of city, county and local governments and nearly 200 public colleges and universities, the report said. As a result, 20 state governments have negotiated pay increases totaling more than $ 382 million in the past 10 years and cities, counties and school districts have raised salaries more than $ 72 million, according to the study. `` A decade-long movement for pay equity has resulted in bankable justice for tens of thousands of public workers,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>. In the jurisdictions that made made pay adjustments, the costs have averaged between 2 percent and 5 percent of total payroll, she said. <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> data for both public and private sector workers shows that in 1988, the average annual pay of women was $ 17,606, or 66 percent of the $ 26,656 average for men. In 1979, women made 59 percent the amount made by men. The Census statistics show black men averaged 74.8 percent of the wages paid white men last year while Hispanic men on average were paid 65.5 percent of what white men were paid. White women were paid an average annual salary of $ 17,851 last year, 65.4 percent of the $ 27,228 paid white men, the Census figures showed. Black women and Hispanic women were paid 60.7 percent and 54.5 percent, respectively, of the totals for white men. The committee's study was most encouraging for women, showing that every state except <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> had studied or were studying how women in the state work force are paid. But only three states have expanded those reviews to study whether minorities receive comparable pay _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` The tackling of race-based wage discrimination problems has come just recently,'' <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> said. `` I think that more and more in the future those who are tracking the issue will look at both race and sex.'' Many states that have studied pay equity have yet to implement a plan to correct any discrimination, the report said, suggesting that advocates of pay equity _ also often referred to as comparable pay _ still face a daunting task, particularly in states with fiscal problems. To help overcome such obstacles, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> said unions, which represent a majority of public-sector workers, are in most cases not seeking back pay adjustments and are willing to receive pay improvements for women and minorities through incremental steps. She said the committee had no solid data on pay equity in private businesses but said corporate leaders contacted by the organization `` are of the opinion that pay equity makes good business sense.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> agreed Thursday to resume normal diplomatic and economic relations seven years after they fought a war over the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. A joint communique read in Spanish and English by Argentine Ambassador <PERSON> Lucio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> del Solar and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Ambassador <PERSON> Crispin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON> said both governments noted that all hostilities had ceased. The announcement followed two days of meetings, the first held between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Buenos </PERSON> <PERSON> Aires </PERSON> surrendered to a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> task force on June 14, 1982, after invading the windswept <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> archipelago. The 74 days of fighting, during which neither side formally declared war, left 1,000 dead. `` Today we've taken a very large step towards normalization of relations,'' <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON> said. `` But we're not there yet.'' The agreement includes re-establishment of consular relations at the consul general level in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> `` to be announced at an early date.'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> del Solar said that date `` was not too far off.'' The agreement to resume consular ties is a precondition to the establishment of full diplomatic relations. Spanish sources had described <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> as being `` more in a hurry'' than <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to come to an agreement because of the Latin American nation's pressing need to normalize economic relations with <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and desire to establish closer ties with the 12-member <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> talks were announced at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Aug. 18. They were made possible after Argentine President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, who took office in July, agreed to drop the insistence of his predecessors that <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s claim to the islands, which it calls the <LOCATION> Malvinas </LOCATION>, had to be the first issue considered in any discussion of normalization. <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON> said there had been no discussion of the reduction of the 2,000-man British military contingent in the 200-island archipelago off the southern tip of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, a move the Argentines reportedly favored. `` I think you can assume there will be no change,'' <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON> said. `` It remains one of the priorities of the British government to protect the security of the islands,'' he said, adding the maintenance of the British military presence remains important to that end. The two countries also agreed to: _ resume air and maritime communications following negotiations by competent authorities; _ lift all remaining commercial and financial restrictions and restrictive practices imposed since 1982; _ not pursue any claim against the other, including nationals of the other, in respect of loss or damage from hostilities and actions in and around the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sandwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>; _ exchange views and proposals about measures to build confidence and avoid tension; _ exchange views on contacts between the islands and the continental mainland; _ renew normal cultural, scientific and sporting exchanges; and _ hold the next substantive meeting in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> Feb. 14-15. For its part, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said it would send a trade mission to <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> Nov. 27 to Dec. 1, make available short-term credit cover for British exports under irrevocable letters of credit from Argentine banks and facilitate cooperative links between <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and the 12 member nations of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> also said it agreed to allow Argentine merchant ships to enter the 150-mile zone of exclusion around the islands and to align the limits of the zone with those of a zone designed to protect the islands' fishing resources. Both countries also agreed to an umbrella clause that protects their respective claims to sovereignty over the islands, which are inhabited by 1,800 people, most of whom are descended from <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> sailors in the 19th century. Argentine claims to the islands are based on the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas by which <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> settled conflicts over land claimed in the New World and on Spanish possession, to which <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> succeeded after declaring independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1816. British claims are based on continuous and effective occupation since 1833.

<TEXT>
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ruled unanimously Thursday that the financial troubles facing the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, nuclear power plant have no impact on whether the plant receives a full-power license. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, opposing the license, said he will appeal the ruling in federal court. <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> officials say the plant could receive a full-power license by the end of the year. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>'s argument that <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the largest share of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, and 11 other owners are financially unable to guarantee the plant's safe operation. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> was seeking a waiver of an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> policy that ignores financial considerations in making licensing decisions. In its ruling, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> said that because <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> will be allowed to charge rates sufficient to run the plant and make payments on past construction costs, consideration of the owners' financial condition is pointless `` The commissioners found the circumstances of the case did n't undercut the assurance from government rate setters of available funds adequate for safe operation,'' said commission spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopeck </PERSON> `` The commission also said that it has n't been shown any other significant link between the applicants' financial condition and safety.'' In January 1988 the utility filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code _ a move that allowed the company to continue operating while it reorganized. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> seized on that development to make the case that the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> should consider financing as a safety concern right along with such other issues as evacuation planning. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>'s case was rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, by an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> appeals board and, on Thursday, by the commission itself. `` There is absolutely no question that we will appeal this,'' said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON>. Completed in mid-1986 for $ 4.6 billion, the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> plant has continued to run up costs from interest payments on borrowed construction money and from operating expenses. The total price tag to date is $ 6.2 billion and rising at the rate of $ 100 million every two months. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> already has a license to conduct low-power testing and went through a battery of tests last spring. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, citing various problems with the plant operation, ordered <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> to cease testing.

<HEAD>Bush Calls Natural Gas `Vital Part' of Future</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday called natural gas a `` vital part'' of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s energy future and said he is `` absolutely determined'' to reduce dependence on foreign sources of energy. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, addessing nearly 200 natural gas suppliers, also appealed for support for his clean air bill, which he said had emerged `` relatively intact'' from a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee last week. The president, noting he once `` had a tiny interest in gas wells'' during his years as a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman, said he remains worried about growing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependence on foreign oil, despite brighter prospects for world peace. `` I do n't like the ever increasing dependency on foreign sources of energy,'' he said. He said Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> is preparing a national energy strategy that will point the way toward bolstering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production. `` That means not only more hydrocarbons, but it also means a safe, sound use of other energy sources,'' sad <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently signed the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, a long sought industry goal. Lifting the last government controls on prices will both spur production and help consumers over the long run, said the president. `` Natural gas is going to be ... vital to our domestic energy security,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` With growing difficulties in oil and gas leasing, and difficulties in siting nuclear plants, we're going to depend more than ever ... on balanced energy sources.'' With both <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> beside him, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his clean air bill is `` good news for clean burning fuels'' such as natural gas. There is `` no question your industry is going to be in the forefront, a vital part of this picture,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imported nearly 50 percent of its oil this past summer, the highest level since the late 1970s. One of the main concerns is that most of the increase is coming from <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> countries, where political unrest could play havoc with the flow of oil. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> addressed the gas suppliers at a briefing in the Old Executive Office Building.

 A 12-year-old boy has been charged with manslaughter in the accidental shooting death of his 7-year-old sister, who was shot while he was playing with a sawed-off shotgun at home. Prosecutors said they determined that <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was grossly negligent in deliberately aiming the weapon at the girl with his finger on the trigger. The gun went off and <PERSON> Calandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> was shot in the face. The shooting in which the boy was charged Wednesday occurred on Sept. 13, before the Oct. 1 effective date of a new state law that penalizes adults who leave weapons left where they can be easily obtained by children. The two children were alone at home at the time of the shooting, and the boy told investigators conflicting stories of what happened, said state attorney's spokesman <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Means </PERSON>. Investigators later determined <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> took the gun from an unlocked cabinet in his 18-year-old brother's bedroom and played with it for a few minutes before returning to his brother's bedroom to put it away. There he saw his sister. Means said the boy pointed the gun at the girl and told her `` something to the effect of: ` Do n't worry. It's not dangerous.''' The gun then went off. Prosecutors believe the shooting was an accident, but <PERSON> Means </PERSON> said the boy's conduct was so careless that it rises to the level of culpable negligence, the standard used to prove manslaughter. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Mattie </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, said when told of the charge: `` I do n't understand it. But we will deal with it.'' Means said prosecutors had not decided whether to charge <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Efrem </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON>, with illegal possession of the short-barreled shotgun, an outlawed weapon. In a similar case in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> in June, a 10-year-old was shot and killed by a 13-year-old, who was not charged. The 13-year-old was not paying attention to where he was aiming the gun when it went off, prosecutors said. That was among a series of similar cases last summer around the state in which children playing with guns accidentally shot other children, injuring or killing them, and led to the new law that took effect Oct. 1 aimed at keeping loaded guns out of the hands of children. Since that law took effect, <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> police have filed one charge against a man whose 8-year-old granddaughter shot herself in the thumb with a pistol taken from an unlocked box. And a prosecutor in <LOCATION> Palatka </LOCATION> has said he would go to a grand jury with a case in which a 12-year-old was killed by a 9-year-old playmate showing off a rifle.

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> experts were teaching <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> engineers how to make bridges earthquake-resistant when reports of the killer <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area quake flashed across the nation. <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, team leader and vice president of Dynamic Isolation Systems, was n't surprised at the news, but was concerned about the safety of his family in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, six miles east of <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, where his office is. `` We do n't consider this a big quake _ a 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale,'' he said at a <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> office where he had been discussing earthquake technology. `` The next one could be the big one _ an 8.0 on the scale _ that would be 10 times as destructive as yesterday's quake.'' Nonetheless, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> could n't make contact with his wife until a day after the Tuesday earthquake that shook <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

This is very significant because the freeway bridge was retrofitted three years ago and it proves that our technology works,'' he said. The bridge had been retrofitted with seismic isolation bearings designed, cube-shaped devices made largely of layers of rubber with a solid lead core. In bridges, the 3-foot-square isolators are installed between the piers and the bridge deck to absorb vibrations caused by an earthquake.

<HEAD>Thatcher Blasts Sanctions Against South Africa, Australia Defends
Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Thursday accused its former colonies in the Commonwealth of promoting poverty through embargoes against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> proposed a plan of tougher financial sanctions. `` Our course is constructive. We want to help the people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said while under attack from fellow <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> leaders, her officials reported. Australian Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>, expressing disappointment at a new agreement by international banks to reschedule South African debt, proposed the Commonwealth press foreign banks to squeeze the white-run government's trade financing. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>, acknowledging reforms by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, stopped short of seeking a wider boycott of South African exports under his plan that would take effect after six months. `` It would be churlish not to acknowledge there have been some recent changes,'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said. But he added the `` fundamentals of apartheid'' remained. The leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>, the 49-nation association of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and its former colonies, will consider the Australian plan this weekend. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> quit the organization in 1961. The debt rescheduling, announced Wednesday, of $ 8 billion of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s $ 20 billion debt by foreign banks enraged some African leaders. <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> denounced the banks, mostly <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and European, as `` bloodsuckers.'' In <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, the guerrilla-backed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the main organization fighting the South African government, on Thursday condemned international banks for the rescheduling, calling it `` an act of inhumanity and as a means of helping to perpetuate the evil system of apartheid.'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said his proposal, jointly sponsored by <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, was supported by most of the other heads of government in the largely Third World organization. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the largest foreign investor in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, agreed to join a 10-nation committee of foreign ministers charged with drawing up the summit's final declaration on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, the sole opponent of sanctions, rejected any tougher measures or giving <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a deadline to end apartheid, the system which disenfranchises the black majority. `` No one in this room would take instructions or accept ultimata,'' a British official quoted her as telling the summit during the closed debate on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` She said she found it strange to be a member of a conference which spent its time trying to increase poverty. In so far as sanctions work, they increase poverty,'' added the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. On the debt rescheduling, she commented that banks `` have a duty to their shareholders'' to recover debts. Without rescheduling, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> may have defaulted or suspended repayments. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said the terms of debt rescheduling agreement were harsh, noting that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> must repay $ 1.5 billion by the end of 1993. Anti-apartheid campaigners said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> had a better deal than severely indebted <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Under the Australian plan, the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> would call on international banks to restrict South African trade credits to a maximum of 90 days and to make it harder for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to get credit or insurance. The proposal also endorses an African-supported blueprint for change stipulating negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> objects to that, too. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> proposed the Commonwealth investigate <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> help of `` post-apartheid <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' He said a <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> committee will meet again in April and review developments in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, including whether de Klerk lifted the state of emergency, stopped hanging people for politically inspired crimes, shown willingness to abolish basic apartheid laws and freed black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said the summit did not, however, set out specific conditions that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> must fulfill by then. South African Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said it is `` irrelevant'' what is decided by such a conference, some of whose member countries `` have never seen an election in their whole history, many of whom do n't have independent judiciaries, many of whom have state-controlled presses.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 adopted 11 non-binding sanctions, including bans on air links, new investment, and imports of agricultural products, iron, steel, coal and uranium. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> strongly resisted the idea of a list but eventually applied a handful of measures. Countries neighboring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> members <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, support sanctions by other countries but refuse to impose them because <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is their leading trade partner. The <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> countries that impose sanctions tend to be ones that never have had extensive contact with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, such as <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and Asian nations.

<TEXT>
 The homes of two prominent leftists were bombed early Thursday, continuing violence that both the military and leftists say is intended to frustrate a fledgling peace process. Two sleeping bodyguards were slightly wounded when a bomb exploded at the home of <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convergence </ORGANIZATION>, a leftist coalition. Earlier, three grenades exploded on the roof and outside the front door of the house next door, where <PERSON> Aronette </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, lives with her two sons. Mrs. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, who is the widow of <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Mario </PERSON>, blamed the army for the attacks. The armed forces press comittee, <LOCATION> COPREFA </LOCATION>, condemned the assaults. `` This kind of action serves only to escalate the violence generated by those who do not want to live in peace,'' said an army communique. <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, his wife and their five children were shaken up but uninjured by the blast. The explosion destroyed the roof over the front rooms of the house in the southern part of the city, as well as doors, ceilings and walls in four rooms. Two cars parked in a carport in front of the house were demolished. Damage to the front rooms of Mrs. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>'s home also was extensive. <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> said the attack on the homes `` is intended to impede a political solution to the war.'' He did not accuse anyone. `` This is the work of people in the army who do n't want dialogue and negotiation,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>. `` They want to start another spiral of violence like in 1980, wheh insurgents waging the war against a succession of U.S.-backed governments. Representatives of the government and leftist rebels on Wednesday ended three days of peace talks in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. They produced no substantive advances toward a cease-fire in their 10-year-old war and managed only to agree to meet again. But both the guerrillas' <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, and the rightist government of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said the groundwork was laid for greater progress in a meeting scheduled Nov. 20 and Nov. 21 in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. The government has proposed an immediate cease-fire, while the rebels first want a series of economic, political and social reforms along with guarantees they will be able to participate in national affairs as a legal political party. A major obstacle has been differences on what constitutes a cease-fire and on how to establish one.

<TEXT>
 The commander of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and allied forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, said Thursday that budget pressures force the nation's military chiefs to haggle over <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending in discussions that resemble Aztec `` bloodletting ceremonies.'' <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, who is the Supreme Allied Commander in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the commander-in-chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, spoke of the internal negotiations that go on among the nation's highest military leaders as they grapple with budget cuts. For the past five years, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has had to deal with declining funds. The four-star general was asked at a meeting with reporters to address the issue that dwindling budget resources means the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> `` ca n't have everything'' it wants and may be forced to cut entire weapons systems. Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, currently embroiled in budget discussions with <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> lawmakers over the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 295 billion budget, has attempted to cut programs such as the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and the F-14D jet fighter, but has met stiff opposition. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said it is clear, that given budget pressures, the nation's military will be pared down. `` Everybody is looking at this ... it's a big thing for us. We face an austere future,'' <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said. `` At the same time ... we are responsible for deterrence and defense, and so how are we going to do this? How are we going to draw up these priority lists?'' The four-star general said he is taking part in Pentagon sessions over the next two days where `` a lot of that is being discussed.'' `` Those are kind of bloodletting ceremonies, like the <LOCATION> Aztecs </LOCATION>. We get up on top of the pyramid and try to work it out,'' <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said. Told that such ceremonies included trying to `` pull the other guy's heart out,'' <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, with a smile, shot back, `` That's what I'm talking about. This is hard work, and hard negotiating among service chiefs.'' The general, who elicited a hearty round of laughter from the reporters with his remarks, hastily added that such negotiations are `` really done in a good spirit.'' The general said he did not want to give the impression that the military chiefs are `` only looking out as far as the end of my nose,'' and `` do n't care what is happening the day after tomorrow.'' He said that in order to respond to the changes that are sweeping the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, as well as the ongoing arms control negotiations, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military chiefs are `` doing a lot of thinking'' and are trying `` to draw closer and closer together on ... If you ca n't have it all, what do you give up?'' <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said that such infighting among the service chiefs `` always goes on, but as you get into more austerity, it gets worse.''

<HEAD>Ivory Ban to Cover Stockpiled Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARE NULLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A worldwide ban on trade in ivory was formally extended Thursday to cover hundreds of tons of supplies already stockpiled, despite arguments that the move will increase smuggling. Environmentalists welcomed the decision by the 103-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which on Tuesday agreed to a ban on ivory trading to protect the dwindling African elephant population. The convention's secretariat proposed that the sale of existing stockpiles be exempt, but delegates Thursday rejected this and endorsed by consensus a decision to apply it to all ivory. Spokesman <PERSON> Jean-Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Duc </PERSON> said the secretariat made the proposal because of fears smugglers will move in to meet demand if the sale of legally acquired stocks is outlawed. That view was echoed by <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, which is believed to hold the majority of stockpiled ivory. `` If existing stocks were allowed to be traded under close monitoring, it would not enhance poaching. A ban might pose more difficulties,'' a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> representative on the British delegation said on condition of anonymity. He said the ban would have a `` drastic impact'' on the 3,000 people in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> who carve and work ivory, many of whom are elderly craftsmen. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, a British colony, has no separate voting rights and officials said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> abstained in the committee vote out of respect for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, the conference approved by consensus a formal ban on ivory trade with a provision that countries that prove sound wildlife management can apply for a resumption of limited trade. This amounts to at least a two-year moratorium because any exemptions are not likely to be considered before the next conference in 1991. Welcoming the decision to include stockpiles in the ban, environmentalist <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Milliken </PERSON> said continued trade in stockpiles `` would have unleashed a nightmare for enforcement -LRB- of the ban -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ivory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> agreed. `` There is far less sympathy for the owners of stockpiles, the majority of which are of illegal origin, than for the African nations affected by the ban which manage their herds well,'' he said. The conference, which ends Friday, was attended by about 400 government delegates and 400 observers from numerous environmental groups. While considering about 300 endangered animals and plants, delegates focused on the African elephant, whose numbers are estimated to have been cut in half to 600,000 in the past decade.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday defeated a proposed constitutional amendment to ban burning and desecration of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag, dealing a sharp rebuff to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on an issue he had put in the spotlight. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> defeated the amendment, `` We do not serve our national tradition by forcing Americans to make a false and unnecessary choice between the flag and the Constitution.'' However, Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` I think the flag should be flown at half-staff after this vote.'' The White House said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` disappointed'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s action The proposal won a slight majority, 51-48, but that was 15 votes short of the two-thirds of senators present and voting that was needed for approval. Democrats led the opposition, but the vote was hardly along strict party lines. Thirty-three Republicans and 18 Democrats voted for the measure, while 11 Republicans and 37 Democrats opposed it. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave final passage last week to a bill to ban flag burning by simple statute. White House spokeswoman <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> said after Thursday's vote that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued to believe that a constitutional amendment offered `` the only ... real protection for the flag'' and that the law, which he will allow to take effect without his signature, `` would not survive constitutional scrutiny.'' He had called for the constitutional amendment in June after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> threw out the conviction of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> flag burner <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> on grounds that a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> flag-burning law violated his constitutional right of freedom of speech. Arguing broke out between the parties even after the vote as Democrats charged that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and GOP National Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> had pushed the amendment to put pressure on them. `` He has used his high office for a low purpose,'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> But Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., noted that 18 Democrats had supported the measure `` I do not think this is a partisan matter that is being engineered for crass political purposes.'' The argument that the issue could be a potent election weapon against senators who opposed the amendment appeared to lose steam this week. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told reporters Thursday morning before the vote that the outcome, by then sure, was due to the `` sound judgment of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' Other lawmakers said most Americans apparently are not overly interested in the proposed amendment. The measure would have authorized state and federal governments to ban burning and desecration of the flag. Critics said the danger to the flag was not as great as to the Bill of Rights. `` For 200 years, they have protected the liberties of Americans through economic turmoil, civil war, political strife, social upheaval and international tension,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` Despite the worst that fate has hurled at us, we have never found it necessary to abandon the fundamental principles on which our government was founded and by which our liberties are secured,'' he added. `` We face no sudden or controllable burst of flag destruction. We face no massive alienation by our people from the symbols and traditions of our nation. Yet we are being asked to believe that the flag which neither <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> could defeat is now threatened by a single misguided person who most Americans never heard of and do n't care about,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. In a final appeal on behalf of the measure, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., took the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor to invoke the history of the flag from Iwo Jima to the moon landing `` To say that the act of flag burning is somehow deeply enshrined in the First Amendment is preposterous,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. He said it was wrong in view of laws that `` make it illegal to rip the warning label off your own mattress in some states.'' `` The purpose, the need, for this amendment will not be found in a textbook or in a treatise on constitutional law,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` No, it will be found in the emotions of the heart, emotions deeply rooted in the real life experiences of millions of Americans and emotions that are crying out today to give the flag real and lasting protection.'' The vote came as no surprise to Republicans. Two GOP co-sponsors, Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, dropped their support Tuesday and joined the ranks of the critics.

 Angry words flew between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s city hall Thursday as the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration came under attack for the second time in a month for steering clear of the Democratic mayor of a city devastated by a natural disaster. `` A publicity stunt,'' was how Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> characterized Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s tour of the earthquake-stricken <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. `` We regret very much that the mayor of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> has decided not to cooperate with us in this matter in making sure that there is adequate federal support for the disaster,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> retorted. The spat between <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> was reminiscent of the controversy surrounding President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> after Hurricane Hugo. The president bypassed <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> despite an invitation from Democratic Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. Instead, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toured suburban <PERSON> Summerville </PERSON>, a community about 20 miles inland which was not as hard-hit as the city. `` Airplane rides and helicopter rides are nice, but everything is on the ground,'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. `` The buildings are on the ground, the people are on the ground, the stress is on the ground and we need a president who is on the ground.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> eight days after <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> devastated the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> area, with his administration under fire from officials including <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> and Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> who said the federal government was bungling relief efforts. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> was left at the airport as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took his whirlwind tour. Republican Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Southern campaign chairman in the last election, and Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, accompanied the president. Asked by reporters at the time why he was left behind, <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> replied: `` I was n't invited.'' In an interview Thursday. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said he shook hands with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the airport, but `` I did n't really have a chance to discuss anything with him. I just had a chance to tell him the people of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> were really hurting.'' The Quayle-Agnos flap erupted as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was preparing to fly to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Friday to view earthquake damage. When <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was asked if the president would meet with <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, the spokesman at first replied: `` The president will meet with mayors and local officials from the local area, absolutely.'' `` What about that mayor?'' pressed reporters. `` Everyone will be invited, absolutely,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. A short time later, the White House announced that the mayors of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Alameda </PERSON> would accompany the president on his tour of the area. The White House insisted that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s decision to pass up a visit with <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> was not politically motivated. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said he was `` ticked off'' by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s decision not to see him separately. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> visited the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area on Wednesday, met with dozens of local and state officials and paved the way for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> complained that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` flies around in a helicopter, makes a bunch of television spots. ... I understand he was in the Marina -LRB- district -RRB-, and in the shelters and then left.'' `` If he did so without visiting the mayor, I have real questions about what he was doing here. It may have been just a publicity stunt.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, in turn, called <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>' charge `` a political shot'' and said: `` We invited all the mayors to come and sit down with us.'' Interviewed on `` CBS This Morning,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said: `` I would hope the mayor would resist any kind of political rhetoric at this time and concentrate'' on helping victims. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> was invited to two separate meetings that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> held with local officials. `` We offered to send a helicopter to pick him up wherever he was and deliver him to the meetings and he declined that,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He also said chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> repeatedly tried to contact Agnos by phone `` and he has declined to talk to us.''

<HEAD>Sources: Americans Witness Libyan Arms Delivery to Somalia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has secretly escalated its weapons supplies to <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> to replace dwindling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid, but the recent arrival of arms and Libyan officers to the port of <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION> was witnessed by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador, sources said Thursday. The Somali government, headed by President <PERSON> Siad </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, has become increasinly desperate to obtain military hardware in the face of growing challenges from rebels in various parts of the country. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> has been shrinking for several years as a protest against the government's human rights abuses, but there are still some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel advising the Somali military. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is currently seeking to renegotiate the agreement for use of the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Berbera </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facility is used mostly by sailors on shore leave from duty in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. A report commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last summer concluded that the Somali army murdered at least 5,000 civilians over an 11-month period. <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, who has also been shunned by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and potential allies in the Moslem world, turned to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> last year but information disseminated by Somali opposition groups about the Libyan deliveries has been hard to verify. `` <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is increasing its assistance to the Somali government. To our knowledge, this includes military hardware, but no troops or military advisers,'' said a recent <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement. But other sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a Libyan ship which docked in <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION> recently discharged 18 Libyan officers, including 6 pilots. The ship also carried 10 tanks and 10 long-range Soviet-made cannons, they said. The ship's docking was witnessed by <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> himself, as well as by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Crigler </PERSON>, said the sources. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that a Libyan ship had docked in <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION> but declined to discuss other details. He said the Libyan aid was `` not massive,'' and included rifles and ammunition. `` But the fact that it's Libyan is disconcerting,'' he added. Dissident Somali groups say <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has also supplied the <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> government with chemical weapons, especially mustard gas, but sources in the intelligence community say there are conflicting views about the veracity of the reports. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> reportedly plans a visit to <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> on Oct. 21. <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, which shifted its alliance from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in 1977, has also been buying arms on the open market although it is experiencing a cash problem because of a heavy foreign debt. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year turned down an administration request to approve $ 21 million for <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> to pay its arrears to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> so it can become eligible for additional loans. The administration decided not to press the request, saying it could not make a convincing case in light of recent events in <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Former Captain Of Exxon Valdez Claims Immunity In Alaska Oil Spill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The former tanker captain whose ship spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil wants a federal court to block his prosecution, arguing that his prompt reporting of the spill grants him immunity. In a motion filed Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fairbanks </LOCATION>, former <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> skipper <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s attorneys argue that a 1976 clean water law precludes criminal prosecution over the nation's biggest oil spill. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> has filed a similar motion in state <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, claiming <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> law also grants immunity from prosecution to people who promptly report spills they cause. The state has filed three felony charges and three misdemeanors against <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>. They accuse him of criminal mischief, operating a ship while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil. Defense attorney <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Madson </PERSON> said state officials are prohibited by federal law from using <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s statements to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in any criminal proceedings. Soon after the <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground on <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> on March 24, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> by radio to report the situation. Within a week, the state filed the misdemeanor charges, and later added the felony criminal mischief counts. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was fired by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. The charges have been consolidated for a single trial, but the case has been postponed repeatedly. A hearing on motions is scheduled Friday. A hearing a week from Friday will determine where his trial is to be held. There was no indication when the federal courts might consider the matter.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passed a bill Thursday allowing opposition parties to compete in national elections, and it also dealt the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> a setback by banning politics from the workplace. The legislators, who have amended the constitution to reflect democratic ideals, rejected an alternative motion by the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to restrict political activities to shop and factory floors. Such politicization of the workplace has been a key weapon of communist indoctrination and is sharply opposed by opposition groups. The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, formed Oct. 7 to replace the communist party that had ruled <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> since 1948, has vowed commitment to democracy, but many of its leaders were ranking members of the old party. Last week, it overwhelmingly approved a motion calling for the right to continue to organize at the workplace. Constitutional amendments formally ending one-party rule and giving political parties the right `` to be freely established and ... -LRB- to -RRB- freely function'' were approved Wednesday. The law passed Thursday formally outlines the rights of parties wishing to field candidates in next year's elections, due by June. They will be the first freely contested elections here since 1947. The bill also places limits on the contributions parties may receive, and it draws the line between funds and property the ruling party legally acquired and other assets owned by the state but controlled by the party. The assets, valued at nearly $ 200 million, have been a contentious issue between the party and the opposition, which claims much party wealth was seized illegally. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has taken `` yet another historic and courageous step toward democracy. `` The constitution institutionalizes many of the laws and practices implemented in recent months to reform <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> from a state controlled by the communist party to one of democratic pluralism,'' she said. A proposed law regulating next year's election envisions a modified system of proportional representation designed to give all parties contesting the elections a chance to win mandates. Interior minister <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Horvath </PERSON>, who presented the bill, said it was evidence of the transition to democracy. `` The franchise ... is a basic political right of the citizens,'' he said. He pledged that the state-owned media will carry each party's manifesto and campaign summary without biased comment Parliament also approved establishment Thursday of a <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which will have the power to dismiss laws contrary to the constitution. Its 15 members will not be permitted to belong to any party or to have recently held any government post. The constitutional amendments passed Wednesday established the office of president of the republic, who will replace the 21-man collective presidency. Still to be decided is when and how the president will be elected. A presidential election is tentatively scheduled Nov. 26. Some opposition groups want the president to be chosen later, fearing the ruling party will have too strong of an advantage if elections are held next month. The issue is expected to be discussed this week.

<HEAD>$1.3 Million Lotto Ticket Found in Cookie Jar Days Before Expiration

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazell </PERSON> found the sweetest treat of all at the bottom of his cookie jar _ a long-forgotten lottery ticket worth $ 1.3 million that would have become worthless just four days later. `` Is n't that something? This was down to the nitty gritty. Another week and I would have lost it,'' the <LOCATION> Metuchen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, correction officer said Thursday. <PERSON> Hazell </PERSON>, 58, bought the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Lotto ticket for the Oct. 22, 1988, drawing at a delicatessen on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, selecting the same numbers he picks every week _ 7, 9, 13, 21, 34 and 43. He dumped the ticket into his cookie jar at home and never checked to see if he won. `` I just stuck it in and forgot all about it,'' said <PERSON> Hazell </PERSON>, who works at the <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Last week, <PERSON> Hazell </PERSON> was back in the deli when he noticed a sign encouraging Lotto players to check their tickets because a $ 1.3 million prize was still unclaimed. A newspaper story pinned next to the sign showed the missing ticket contained his numbers. That's when <PERSON> Hazell </PERSON> began to search `` I looked everywhere, because I saw my numbers. I went through dressers, drawers, under the mattress. I went through a bag where I throw all my losing tickets,'' he said. Then, <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> said he got a feeling about the cookie jar and went to check it out: `` There it was, all by itself.'' Winners have one year to produce their tickets. <PERSON> Hazell </PERSON> showed up Wednesday, with just 96 hours to spare. State lottery spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowlton </PERSON> said it was the longest anybody had ever waited to claim a prize. Two other people also picked winning numbers in the same drawing and both had already claimed their shares of a $ 4 million jackpot, he said. <PERSON> Hazell </PERSON>, whose winning numbers combined his birthday, anniversary, daughter's age and license plate number, said the windfall wo n't have any immediate effect on his lifestyle. `` I'm not going to retire. I'm a young 58, going on 25,'' he said. `` I'm going to stay very active.'' `` It's like a dream. It's wonderful. All of a sudden, I do n't know if I'm a celebrity or not.

 A public argument on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has stalled peace efforts at least until Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next month, officials said Thursday. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> declared Tuesday the two allies were `` entering a period of tension'' and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` will not be pushed or pressured.'' The next day, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> described his comments as `` unhelpful.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, said Thursday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> feel `` creative diplomacy'' can renew progress toward peace in the region. `` No doors have been closed; no last words have been spoken,'' <PERSON> Wisner </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> after spending more than three hours at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. He delivered a message from Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON>, the Egyptian foreign minister. <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> would not say what the message contained. He later told a meeting of the U.S.-Egyptian chamber of commerce that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> wants the American role in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> politics to continue. Until the remarks Tuesday to members of his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had avoided confrontations with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders despite his disagreement with the dialogue <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> began in December with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>, director of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s office, said the prime minister spoke out because of what he considered growing attempts by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to get <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> into negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> defines the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a terrorist group and refuses to deal with it. `` What he meant was that there is liable to be a period of differences, but he is doing everything to prevent it,'' <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said in an interview Thursday. On Thursday, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio revealed another apparent effort to diffuse tensions. The radio said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> praising his efforts to advance peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> but emphasizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s opposition to talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aides could not be reached for comment on the letter. The latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts, led by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, are aimed at starting Israeli-Palestinian talks about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s plan for residents of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to elect delegates for negotiations with the Israelis. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Cabinet leadership rejected <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s suggestions two weeks ago, claiming they opened the door to indirect <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> involvement, but <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> pursued the matter in private conversations with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>. Ahimeir indicated <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> felt the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had betrayed the essence of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> plan, which excludes the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are sorry that only five months have passed'' since <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> introduced the peace plan `` and everyone has already lost patience and is running to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> with open arms,'' he said. `` There are now changes in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> position and they want to add things. We will not accept anything where the bottom line will be to sit down with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' News reports in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> called President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday, after making his comments, to take issue with the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace moves. Ahimeir confirmed the 10-minute conversation occurred, but would not give detais. He said only that the tone was `` friendly'' and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> expressed his views. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION>, quoting a senior <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration official it did not name, said the president told <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> he was `` disappointed'' by the remarks. Two senior Israeli officials said privately the result of the conversation was a decision to put a temporary hold on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace efforts until <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in mid-November. A statement from <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s office Thursday said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided to discuss peace issues further at that time. Israeli newspapers criticized the prime minister's comments. Even the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> published an editorial Thursday called `` Shamir is Looking for Confrontation.'' It said the Americans might respond by turning to pressing domestic matters and putting the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> on the back burner because, `` after all, advancing toward peace in the region is more important for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> than for them.''

<HEAD>Sparse Food Supply Forces Black Bears Into Cities, Campgrounds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDY SHORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Black bear sightings in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> cities and campgrounds have doubled this year because dry weather has cut into the animals' normal food supply, forcing them to risk confrontations with humans. Scavenging bears have pawed through campsites, trash cans and dumps, showed up on golf courses, and even entered one home to empty a refrigerator of groceries and wine. `` They are capable of eating so many different things,'' said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Malmsbury </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> public information officer. `` They'll be happy to go up to a picnic table and eat your breakfast for you.'' <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s spring and summer were drier than normal, which damaged the berry and acorn crops as well as foliage that bears feed on, officials said. The plight of the hungry bears has become more evident as the animals prepare to hibernate in early November. If female bears hibernate without an adequate fat reserve, they can lose their cubs; other bears without enough fat can die. But biologists wo n't know what kind of effect the food shortage will have on the mortality rate until spring when a survey of cubs can be made, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, a state wildlife biologist based in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Srings </LOCATION>. Although the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> wildlife agency does not keep statewide figures on bear sightings, <PERSON> Malmsbury </PERSON> said a good guess would be they have at least doubled this year. `` We've had problems almost statewide. You tend to have more problems where the people are,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, a state wildlife biologist based in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, there have been 26 bear sightings since August, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Birkhauser </PERSON>, a conservation officer with the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of Game and Fish. That compares with one or two sightings in an average year. `` Statewide, we've been having trouble,'' <PERSON> Birkhauser </PERSON> said. `` The extreme hotspots are <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, of course, because it's a big metro area, and down near <LOCATION> Capitan </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Capitan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> where the bears are feeding on sheep.'' In southeastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, which has the state's largest concentration of black bears, wildlife officers have trapped and relocated more than 60 bears, <PERSON> Malmsbury </PERSON> said. Fewer than 20 bears are trapped and relocated in that area in an average year. Along the Front Range of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>, which includes metropolitan <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, about 100 bears have been sighted this year, he said. At least nine have been trapped and relocated, and 11 have been killed either accidentally or because they were a danger to humans. Neither <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> has reported conflicts with black bears and humans. The problems have been compounded by people who are careless with trash or feed the animals directly, and other human activity, said <PERSON> Malmsbury </PERSON>. `` Barbecue smells are extremely attractive to bears, and they carry a long distance,'' <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said. `` Bears have an acute sense of smell and they follow their nose right to it.'' One bear recently was killed after it broke into a home in the mountain community of <LOCATION> Evergreen </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, and `` ripped open the refrigerator door, ate food and drank wine,'' <PERSON> Malmsbury </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, early morning golfers reached the fifth hole and looked up to see a 5-year-old female bear in a tree, <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said. The animal was trapped and moved to a wilderness area. In July, state wildlife officers killed a bear that attacked a woman at a campground in the foothills west of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The bear ripped open her tent, apparently to get at food she had inside, officials said. Black bears usually grow to about 5 feet and weigh between 200 pounds and 300 pounds on the average. There are from 8,000 to 12,000 of them in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, mostly in the southern region of the state. `` The black bear, by nature, is not going to be an aggressive animal normally,'' <PERSON> Malmsbury </PERSON> said. `` Some bears weigh over 400 pounds and are 6 feet tall. He can do pretty much whatever he wants to.''

 Among the casualties of the earthquake was an anti-drug beachhead that the <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> had established on a seedy block in the Tenderloin district. The six-story Camelot Hotel was condemned because of earthquake damage and police evacuated residents early Thursday. The Angels, a volunteer group known for its red berets and controversial crime-fighting tactics, left shortly after Tuesday's quake. `` They're going to relocate us somewhere, I suppose,'' said resident <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 65, who leaned on a metal cane as he looked up at the white stucco building, sandwiched between a peep-show video parlor and a bar. `` I came out of prison and it was the only place I could get,'' said <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, who moved in four years ago. The Angels made their headquarters on the third floor, where a `` Crackdown on Crack'' sign hung in a window. Neighbors said the <PERSON> Angels </PERSON> used citizen's band radios and called the police when they saw trouble. `` They helped clean out this block,'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said. `` Crack was sold on this block.'' `` It was better that they were here than not,'' said another resident, who identified himself only as <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON>. `` People did -LRB- drugs -RRB- in their rooms, not in the hallways like it used to be.'' The Angels, numbering about 10 residents and staff, left for an unknown location after the earthquake, <PERSON> Camelot </PERSON> residents and neighbors said. <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON>, 42, said the hotel, which charged between $ 250 and $ 350 a month, was in bad repair, but its closure leaves him nowhere to live. A desk clerk awakened the 20 to 30 remaining residents about 4 a.m. Thursday, and told them the building had been condemned. A large crack was visible on the hotel's top floor, and tenants said the top two floors were uninhabitable. Like others displaced from rundown Tenderloin hotels, the residents were taken by bus to emergency shelters at <ORGANIZATION> Moscone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a half-mile away. `` I'm tired. I need a bath. This is rough, man,'' said <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON>, whose hotel three blocks away was cleared of more than 100 residents Tuesday night. `` I need money. I need help.''

 A new plan to cut capital-gains taxes and expand <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounts </ORGANIZATION> was introduced Thursday with the support of a majority of senators and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., who, with Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Del., wrote the bill, told reporters he expects it to become law this A solid majority of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> already has voted for a capital-gains tax cut _ as part of deficit-reduction legislation _ that carried the endorsement of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But that proposal did not affect IRAs and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the legislation does not include the capital-gains provision. `` This plan provides opportunities and incentives for all Americans,'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said. `` It's good for both savers and investors. And it's good for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Allowing one of the saving incentives without the other `` would be like a henhouse without a rooster,'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said. `` You may still get the eggs but you're not going to keep the hens happy.'' <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> said he can count 55 to 58 votes for the measure. `` The administration supports this bill, although it would support some alternatives'' as well, he said. Negotiators from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> met for the first time to try to write a compromise deficit-reduction bill, but as expected got nowhere. The key gulf between the two chambers is over whether to remove a capital gains tax cut and other provisions from the legislation, and what would happen to them if they were removed. Those decisions ultimately will be made by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders but negotiators met to state their positions. Senators insisted that the money-saving legislation be kept free of controversial items, with Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, saying, `` We're not going to put them on this bill.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, R-Minn., and other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members expressed a reluctance to strip capital gains and other items from the budget-cutting bill and assume `` everything else will fall into place. The Roth-Packwood bill would: _ Exclude from taxation up to 35 percent of individual capital gains, which are profits from the sale of stock and other investments The longer an asset were held, the less it would be taxed. Five percent of the gain from the sale of assets owned more than one year would be excluded; if the asset were held more than seven years, 35 percent of the gain would be excluded. As an option, an investor could exclude from taxation any gain caused solely by inflation. Present law fully taxes capital gains, just as it does wages and salaries. _ Cut the tax rate on corporate capital gains, now 34 percent, to as low as 29 percent _ Permit individuals to set aside up to $ 2,000 a year in an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, increasing to $ 3,000 a year after five years There would be no tax deduction on the contribution; instead, the contribution and interest it earned could be withdrawn tax-free for retirement, paying for a college education, medical expenses or buying a first home. The plan would permit workers who in the past have made tax-deductible contributions to an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> to `` roll over'' those accounts into one of the new types in order to become eligible for tax-free withdrawals for education, medical expenses or homebuying. However, that rollover would require the worker to pay tax over the following four years on the original tax-free contributions. For example, a worker who contributed to an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and 1986 could transfer that money into one of the new accounts in 1991 and pay taxes on the transfer in 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994. The congressional <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Taxation estimates that because of the rollover provision, the plan would raise federal revenues by $ 1.3 billion over the next five years. Workers who are allowed under present law to make tax-deductible <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> contributions would not lose that opportunity. This includes any worker not covered by a company pension, any covered couple with income under $ 50,000 and a covered single person with income under $ 35,000. If the <LOCATION> Roth-Packwood </LOCATION> proposal is to become law, it would have to be attached to some House-passed revenue bill. A prime candidate is a debt-limit measure that must be passed this year to raise the government's borrowing authority. The House-passed capital-gains amendment is part of a huge deficit-reduction bill on which <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators began working Thursday.

<TEXT>
 The top Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel that heard evidence against federal Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> this summer said Thursday that he will vote to acquit the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> jurist of impeachment charges. Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., said in a 76-page paper that after weighing the evidence and considering an `` unblemished lifetime record,'' he decided `` there is insufficient evidence to convict'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of plotting to obtain a bribe The paper was circulated by <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> among his fellow lawmakers as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> closed its doors to the public to deliberate in the impeachment trial. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday heard closing arguments from <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> and his attorneys as well as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who brought the 17 impeachment charges. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said that if the lawmakers finished their closed-door deliberations on Thursday they would vote on Friday on whether to remove <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> bench. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> would immediately be removed and his $ 89,500 salary would be stopped if he were convicted of any one of the 17 impeachement charges approved in August 1988 by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, the first black federal judge in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> history, is accused of conspiracy to obtain a $ 150,000 payoff, lying about it to a jury that acquitted him of the charge in 1983 and improper disclosure of information obtained through a court-authorized wiretap. In his statement to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, the affable, 53-year-old <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> reaffirmed his denial that he took part in a bribery conspiracy. <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, vice chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel that heard 18 days of evidence this summer, noted that prosecutors at the 1983 trial told jurors that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was lying. `` Obviously the jury did not accept those arguments.'' He said the case that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> had improperly disclosed information obtained from a wiretap `` was neither convincing nor substantial.'' Conviction would make <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> the sixth official in history removed by impeachment. The most recent was Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> in 1986 who fought in vain to remain on the bench while serving a tax fraud sentence. District Judge <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, convicted of lying to a grand jury, is also fighting to remain on the federal bench. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was accused of plotting with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Borders </PERSON> in 1981 to obtain the payoff from two defendants in his court. He had sentenced them to prison terms for their role in a pension fraud scheme. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> undercover agent posing as one of the defendants contacted Borders and offered him $ 150,000 in exchange for a reduction of the sentences to probation. The attorney was arrested Oct. 9, 1981, as he left a suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> motel with the agent and a garment bag containing $ 125,000 in cash. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a testimonial dinner in honor of Borders that night, was told that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> wanted to contact him but immediately returned to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> by an indirect route without checking out of his hotel.

<HEAD>Private Eye Wins Appeal on Libel Damages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA BALDWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An appeals court Thursday canceled the bulk of a record $ 960,000 libel award against the satirical magazine Private Eye and recommended tighter guidelines for juries in assessing libel damages. Three judges dismissed the magazine's appeal but reduced to $ 40,000 the damages awarded by a High Court jury in May to <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON>, the estranged wife of a mass murderer known as the <ORGANIZATION> Yorkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ripper </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is what we hoped for,'' said Private Eye's managing director, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON>. `` We would like to think that this decision today will go some way toward stemming the growing tide of libel actions and the trend toward juries making absurdly high awards.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s libel laws give juries freedom to set damages without any guidance from judges. Those who allege they have been libeled do not claim a set amount of damages and there are no upper or lower limits on the amount juries can award. Judge Lord <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> of the Court of Appeal said he could not believe the High Court jury had appreciated how large their award was. `` What is, I think, required is some guidance to juries in terms which will assist them to appreciate the real value of large sums,'' he said. Another judge, Sir <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nourse </PERSON>, said the award must have been made on a wrong basis because, he said, without realizing they were exceeding their function, the jurors included a very large sum to make an example of the defendants. Legal experts said Thursday's decision could mark the end of U.S.-style libel awards in British courts. `` Basically what the appeal court appears to be saying is that they hope a judge will correct any misconceptions the jury might have,'' said libel lawyer <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON>. The court dismissed Private Eye's request for a retrial. The magazine had said new evidence would justify its stories, which claimed Mrs. <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON> had tried to profit from her husband's notoriety by selling her story to a newspaper Mrs. <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON> denies that she sold her story. The judges deferred their decision on further reducing the $ 40,000 in damages and said judgment on who will pay the $ 160,000 in court costs will come later. Mrs. <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON> was not in court, but her lawyer, <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pembridge </PERSON>, said: `` Mrs. <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON> is relieved that the matter is nearly over and pleased that the judges have dismissed Private Eye's new evidence.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON> was jailed for life in 1981 for killing 13 women and attempting to kill five more. Mrs. <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON> was not implicated in any of the crimes. <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, whose 16-year-old daughter was among <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON>'s victims, welcomed the ruling. `` This all boils down to money,'' she said. `` Events like this bring all the awful memories back.'' After the High Court ruling on May 24, Private Eye's editor, <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hislop </PERSON>, declared: `` If this is justice, then I am a banana.'' <PERSON> Hislop </PERSON> said Thursday that `` Lord <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> and his colleagues have decided that I am not a banana. Our future looks a ... lot better than it did.'' The magazine asked readers for contributions to support its appeal. If any of the $ 150,000 collected is left after court costs, it will be given to a trust fund for relatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Yorkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ripper </ORGANIZATION>'s victims, <PERSON> Hislop </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A major drug manufacturer on Thursday announced a new program to provide easily understood information to patients about its most widely used prescription drugs. <PERSON> G.D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it was initiating the program in light of a new survey showing that nearly half the drugs prescribed yearly are taken incorrectly. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, along with Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, endorsed the program as a voluntary, private sector effort important to public health. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> called it `` a step forward that should be followed by other pharmaceutical manufacturers in this country,'' but he said he would not want the government to require companies to initiate their own programs. `` I do n't like to make matters mandatory if we can do it on a voluntary basis,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> requires drug companies to provide to patients information on certain drugs, including birth control pills. It also has encouraged companies to distribute information voluntarily for some drugs that have more serious side effects. An <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> program to require package inserts for 10 prescription drugs was initiated during the late 1970s. But the program ran into resistance from pharmacists, physicians and the prescription drug industry and was scrapped in 1981, before it got off the ground. Consumer groups have long favored efforts to distribute more information to patients about prescription drugs, and some countries are moving in that direction. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> will require drug companies to distribute such information beginning in January 1992. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilgore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> chairman, said the plan, which will be instituted worldwide by the end of 1990, is the most comprehensive voluntary patient-information program by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug company. He said the company initially will provide to physicians information sheets they can give to patients explaining in nontechnical terms the potential side effects of three drugs and the possible interactions the medicines can have with other drugs. The three drugs are <ORGANIZATION> Calan </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Calan </ORGANIZATION> SR, used to treat high blood pressure, and Cytotec, an ulcer preventive. These account for about three-quarters of <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s nearly $ 1 billion in annual domestic sales. Company officials said the rest of <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s products, as well as future products, will be covered by the program. About 15 percent of the company's drug products are oral contraceptives, for which the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> already requires written information for patients. <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> said a telephone survey of 1,000 prescription drug users, conducted during the last week of September by <ORGANIZATION> Pracon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said nearly half do not follow the dosage instructions of their medicine.

<HEAD>Forty Cents of Every Dollar to Cleanup, OTA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government's Superfund money has not been spent wisely, with only some 40 percent going to clean up toxic waste dumps, a congressional study said Thursday. `` Analysis breeds paralysis,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> said in noting that only about three dozen of the 1,200 priority cleanup sites have been declared completely clean. During the last three years, 60 percent of the $ 4.4 billion spent by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on Superfund went for administration, management or site studies rather than cleanup, said a report from the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION>. OTA concluded that while the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has estimated another 900 toxic waste sites likely will be added to its priority list over the next decade, the number could be 10 times that with a better administered program. The report, entitled `` Coming Clean,'' said while private Superfund contractors keep busy, `` reports pile up, contamination spreads into soil and groundwater, many sites wait to get into the -LRB- cleanup -RRB- system.'' <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Crampton </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> associate administrator for communications and public affairs, said the agency's figures show 60 to 70 percent of the money is related to site cleanup. The percentage will increase starting later this year, he said, when major construction work begins on a number of sites. `` It depends on how you define what is spending directly on cleanup and what is inefficient,'' he said, adding the agency has asked OTA to explain its percentages. <PERSON> Crampton </PERSON>, defending preparatory studies, added, `` You ca n't expect to stick a shovel in the ground and get rid of this stuff -LRB- toxic waste -RRB-. Studies are needed to characterize the hazard, decide on the proper remedy and test different technologies, all work that must be handled by contractors, he said. Reps. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich. and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON>, D-N.Y. both noted <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> has taken steps to improve Superfund <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> added `` the constructive aspects of the <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> report may be overshadowed by its excessive emphasis on speculative statistics.'' Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., said the study `` paints a disturbing picture which questions just how permanent and complete these cleanups actually are and how wisely the money used to administer the program has been spent. The report said the Superfund's problem is not one of money, but that funds too often were misdirected rather than aimed at reducing the significant health and environmental threats posed by toxic waste sites. Often, money spent directly on cleanup efforts went toward `` reducing hypothetical risks which may not materialize'' instead of to dealing with immediate health threats, it said. At the same time, the report claimed that too often the government has chosen _ or allowed the polluters themselves to choose _ cleanup methods that `` are unlikely to work over the long term.'' In an attempt to reduce government costs, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is getting industry to assume more cleanup activities, but also is allowing industry to use less stringent cleanup technologies, possibly saving as much as $ 1 billion, the study said.

 A 12-year-old girl was working so hard on her school examination paper Thursday that she was n't aware a bullet had lodged in her hair. It was only after a classmate told <PERSON> Demetra </PERSON> <PERSON> Achilleos </PERSON>, `` Look, you are dropping bullets from your hair,'' that she made the unusual discovery.

A window in the classroom shattered and small pieces of plaster fell on their heads from the ceiling. `` I felt something like a slight burning pain on top of my head but I did not give it much thought at the time,'' <PERSON> Demetra </PERSON> said later. `` I thought it was a piece of glass from the broken window. When I realized what had happened and how close I had come to being seriously hurt I became frightened and cried.'' The bullet apparently hit her head after ricocheting off the ceiling, with much of its force spent. Police asked <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers who patrol the zone to investigate. <LOCATION> Dherynia </LOCATION> villagers said shots are occasionally fired from the Turkish lines toward the village, though nobody has been hurt. <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> has been divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion.

It's been a crazy day,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a local <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> program director. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he was concerned about victims of the quake and, `` Hearing -LRB- <PERSON> Dees </PERSON> -RRB- talk about the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> needing money made me think of it.'' `` It was a real catalyst,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, an assistant to <PERSON> Dees </PERSON>. `` Since <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> did that, we've been getting calls from businesses wanting to donate money ... everyone is moved by this guy's generosity.'' A later contestant for the Miata also planned to give the cash equivalent to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> if she won, and when she lost she gave the $ 100 consolation prize instead.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration may speed up the planned withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military dependents from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the White House said Thursday. Gen. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>, the newly appointed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military commander in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, also has recommended shortening soldiers' tour of duty so that fewer bring their families to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in March 1988 in a campaign to oust strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has held onto power, nullifying last May's elections and installing a crony on Sept. 1 as president. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials last May began evacuating military dependents, and as of July 1, some 6,300 <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> personnel had either been sent home or relocated onto <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. But there are still roughly 11,000 American dependents in the country, said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, who added, `` We are reviewing the issue right now of whether or not that -LRB- withdrawal -RRB- should be accelerated.'' Currently, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 10,000 soldiers permanently assigned to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, 2,500 military personnel there on temporary duty, 7,700 military dependents, 2,700 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> civilian <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees and 3,300 civilian dependents. The `` ultimate purpose'' is to get family members back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> had formally recommended to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that tours of duty in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> be reduced so that fewer soldiers bring families with them to the troubled region. <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> wants to cut from 15 months to 12 months the tour length for those going alone to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The standard tour for military personnel bringing family members to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> would be cut from 30 months to 24 months, and `` only a very few'' would be allowed to remain there on a full 24-month rotation, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>'s recommendations were designed `` to ensure the security of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military members and their families in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> wanted to emphasize that while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces have no quarrel with the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, the American military personnel serving in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> must remember `` the situation is a sustained, classic, low-itensity conflict,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` Their mission is counter-terrorism, their mission is protection of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military assets.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for drug trafficking. On Oct. 3 he quashed an attempted coup that received minimal support from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. The withdrawal of dependents began last spring following a series of incidents, including harassment and physical assaults against some Americans.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, as a newly elected member of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, should start showing respect for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions by ending assistance to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> was one of five countries to be elected to <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> seats Wednesday. It is the first time <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has been chosen for a seat since the 1959 revolution. `` We hope <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> will recognize that it has a special responsibility as a member of <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to act constructively to end regional conflicts, not contribute to them,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. She said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> should bear in mind that the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents have asked the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to create a force to ensure that no state provides support to irregular forces, which include the Salvadoran rebel group known by its Spanish initials <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. She noted that a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution approved several weeks ago called on all member states to halt all overt or covert aid to insurrectional forces in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is the principal violator of that <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution and the principal arms supplier to the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. `` We hope its tenure on the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> will begin with Cuban adherence to the resolution.'' <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> had the endorsement of other Latin American nations for the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> seat. The action of the Latin American countries suggested that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's policy of hostility toward <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is not widely shared elsewhere in the hemisphere. On a related subject, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> deplored the bombing in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> of the home of leftist political leader <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>. On Wednesday, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> condemned the killing of the young daughter of a military officer in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and Thursday, she said, `` we condemn with equal vigor this reprehensible act against Mr. <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> and his family.'' The spokeswoman said she not know who was responsible for the attack. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> also responded to a report contending that the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> military has conducted a nationwide campaign of killings, harassment and torture against doctors and health care workers and attacked rebel field hospitals in violation of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Convention. Based on the report, written by seven Americans, including five doctors, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has requested specific information on cases in which there were claims of harassment, she said. `` There is no evidence of a Salvadoran governmment policy of harassment or abuse of health workers,'' she said. `` There is no doubt that the provision of health care and services by the government could be improved.'' The team concluded that the alleged persecution of medical personnel was part of a campaign to obstruct religious and relief workers in order to undermine support for the guerrillas.

 Tens of thousands of Armenians, whose homeland was devastated by an earthquake last December, met in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>'s central square on Thursday night to organize aid for victims of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> quake, an activist said. `` People came from all over, from factories, institutes, work collectives,'' said <PERSON> Galstyan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambartsumyan </PERSON> in a telephone interview. `` We are collecting money, clothing _ we just have to find out what is needed.''

Aid flowed into the area from all over the world, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The death toll in the northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> quake, which had the same intensity of 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale as the Armenian one, has claimed more than 270 lives, authorities estimated. <PERSON> Amburtsyan </PERSON> said the crowd at Thursday's meeting was more than happy to donate funds to the victims, `` but we only have Soviet money'' _ which is worthless outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 Private exporting companies have sold the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> an additional 1.2 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn for delivery in 1989-90 under a long-term supply agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Orders since Oct. 1, the beginning of the agreement's new year, now total more than 5 million tons of corn, 143,700 tons of soybeans and 325,000 tons of soybean meal. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain sales to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1988-89 were a record of more than 21.7 million tons, including more than 16.3 million tons of corn and nearly 5.4 million tons of wheat. In addition, 1988-89 sales included 1.35 million tons of soybean meal and 1.02 million tons of grain sorghums. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 1.2 million tons of corn would be more than 47 million bushels. The new sales were made by unidentified private exporting companies, which are required to report large sales to the department. No selling prices or further details were released. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.27 per bushel at the farm level, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s five-day average, meaning that the latest sale could have a farm value of about $ 107 million.

<TEXT>
 New management policies, including fewer controversial `` clear cuts,'' will be adopted to preserve more old-growth trees in the national forests, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, associate chief of the service, said he guessed the new policies would preserve about half the nation's old growth stands _ more in some areas, less in others, depending on the tree species involved in and other things. `` Not all of the old growth is going to be preserved,'' he said. `` My guess it's going to be substantially over half of the remaining old growth -LRB- that -RRB- will be preserved,'' he said. The new policies will have the greatest impact on old-growth forests in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> but will be applied to all forests in the system, including eastern hardwoods and soft pines of the South. The old-growth forests _ often never cut before, and distinguished by old trees and accumulations of dead material _ provide living space for many species of wildlife, including the controversial spotted owl in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recently approved compromise provisions aimed at protecting the owl in $ 11.2 billion spending measure for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and related agencies like the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The legislation, designed to permit continued logging in the old-growth forests of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, calls on the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> to `` minimize fragmentation of significant old-growth forest stand.'' No timber sales would be allowed in areas already identified as spotted owl habitat. Lawmakers sought a way to ensure <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> mills of a steady supply of timber from the region's old-growth forests while the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> decides whether to declare the northern spotted owl an endangered species. Such declarations require federal agencies to protect the habitats of the species in question. The spotted owl lives almost exclusively in old-growth forests and each nesting air requires a very large area. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will reduce the use of traditional clear-cutting methods in which all or most trees in an area are cut, and will increase retention of snags, dead-and-down material and logging debris that could be used by wildlife. Also some forest stands will be managed on `` extended rotations'' to develop old-growth characteristics. Some of those rotations would be for 150 to 200 years or longer. Agency Chief F. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said in a statement that `` we do not anticipate an immediate impact on our timber sale program since our forest plans provide for many old-growth values.'' However, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> added that `` there will be an impact when we complete the final forest plans in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and as we amend or revise other forest plans due to a greater emphasis on old-growth values.'' Asked about wildlife species that might benefit from the new policy's use in eastern hardwood forests, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said the red cockaded woodpecker in southern pine forests was one example but he was not aware of any in old-growth hardwoods. `` But certainly we're looking at the impact of cutting and the way we lay out our -LRB- timber -RRB- sales on bear habitat, on <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> habitat,'' he said. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said the recent years of controversy over old-growth forests, the spotted owl and other environmental factors have been fierce and will take time to heal. `` I've been involved in national forest management issues for over 30 years, and I've never found a situation that was more polarized than the issue over the management of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> lifted a two-month grounding order on some of its CH-47D Chinook medium-lift helicopters Thursday, saying it had identified vibration as the most probable cause of oil cooling fan failures earlier this year. The grounding was ordered as a precautionary measure after oil cooling fans failed on CH-47Ds at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> No one was injured in either incident, nor were the aircraft damaged, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday's order affected 211 of the 264 helicopters that had been grounded. Those helicopters had not experienced fan failures. Vibration limits have been established and those aircraft will be checked every 25 hours of flight time, the statement said. The 53 Chinooks that remain grounded have experienced fan failures in the past and will undergo `` further testing and evaluation'' before they are approved for flight, the statement said.

 Rockets slammed into the capital's airport and civilian flights were halted Thursday as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was reported to be undertaking the largest airlift since its military withdrawal eight months ago The government said shelling in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> killed 12 people and wounded 35, though two doctors at a hospital that monitors casualties said they did not know of any victims. The U.S.-backed guerrillas also shelled a strategic town near the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border, killing nine people, the government said. Diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, said it was the largest <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> airlift since February, when Soviet troops ended their nine-year intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said Soviet-built Antonov-12 transport planes were flying continuously into the airport, dropping off weapons and food for soldiers. They said the planes were also flying night missions. Two soldiers said all commercial traffic was shut down for most of the afternoon but Soviet transport planes were operating despite the shelling. Witnesses said at least five rockets hit the airport grounds, but there were no immediate casualty or damage reports there. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, R-Pa., estimated <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has increased its aid to $ 400 millinagers to take early retirement <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T outperformed its <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> offspring, which reported diverging results.

Analysts praised <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's cost-cutting step, saying the company has too many managers in light of its sluggish sales of computers and network equipment. `` They're doing exactly what I think they need to do,'' said <PERSON> Lap </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> analyst. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T will double to 34,000 the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments. It is also offering a special sweetened pension plan for managers who choose to retire on Dec. 30. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T embarked on an aggressive cost-cutting program beginning in 1984, the year it lost its local operating companies in the breakup of the Bell System. Since then the company has cut its payroll from 373,000 to 298,000. This is the first program aimed only at managers. The largest single job cut in the company's history came in late 1986, when <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T eliminated 32,000 jobs. The company has relied on incentives when slashing employment, but <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> noted that this is the first `` pension sweetener'' in <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T history. `` We are in a topsy-turvy marketplace, and we need to have as many people at the elbows of our customers as possible and as few people in non-sales, behind-the-scenes jobs as possible,'' <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said. The retirement option will increase expenses in the fourth quarter, but the amount can not be determined until the number of participants is determined. The company said the higher expenses would be offset by other items, including a gain from a share exchange that ends its direct investment in Ing. <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. SpA <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T reported profits rose 19 percent to $ 699 million, or 65 cents a share in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $ 587 million, or 55 cents a share a year ago. Revenue increased 1 percent to $ 8.9 billion from $ 8.81 billion in the third quarter a year ago. For the nine-month period, profit totaled $ 1.99 billion, or $ 1.85 a share, up 19 percent from $ 1.67 billion, or $ 1.56 a share, a year ago.

He said <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T will `` continue to be aggressive in the marketing of our products and services, and aggressive as well in continuing to drive costs out of every part of our business.'' <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, two of the companies carved out of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T in the 1984 breakup, reported differing results. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> attributed its gains partly to strong growth in telephone usage, while <ORGANIZATION> U </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> said its profit dip was the result of special factors that masked `` modest earnings growth.'' <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> said its profit rose to $ 363.2 million, or $ 1.82 a share, from $ 341 million, or $ 1.72 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $ 2.91 billion from $ 2.76 billion. For the first nine months, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> said profit rose to $ 1.07 billion, or $ 5.43 a share, from $ 1.01 billion, or $ 5.12 a share, a year earlier.

Revenue fell to $ 2.32 billion from $ 2.43 billion. `` Nevertheless, we're not satisfied with these results. The major negative factor is the cumulative impact of regulatory activity over the past two years on our telephone operations,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON>, U S West's chairman and chief executive. For the year to date, <ORGANIZATION> U </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> said earnings fell to $ 766.3 million, or $ 4.17 a share, from $ 860 million, or $ 4.68 a share, a year earlier.

<HEAD>Government Ordering Cutback In Use Of Nitrate In Bacon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it will prohibit use of sodium nitrate in the processing of dry-cured bacon, which makes up about 2 percent of the total bacon made in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Officials said also that the amount of sodium nitrite used in the dry curing of bacon will be reduced. The regulation for both will be effective Jan. 18, 1990. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the move `` will help avoid any health risk from nitrosamine formation when these types of bacon are fried.'' Nitrites can combine with amines in meat to form nitrosamines, and certain types of those have been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals. About 98 percent of the bacon in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is made by `` pumping'' curing solutions containing nitrite into pork bellies. The agency has prohibited nitrates and limited nitrites in the pumping solutions since 1978. Nitrites are used in the curing of meat to guard against spoilage and harmful organisms, and to give bacon a distinctive color and taste.

 Americans touched by scenes of devastation, of people left homeless by disaster, sent what they could to earthquake victims in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Thursday just one month after shipping aid to those in Hurricane Hugo's wake. Even <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, still reeling from last month's pounding by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, sent a plane load of bottled drinking water. And on the other side of the globe, tens of thousands of Armenians organized aid for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> victims. Private groups and officials sent search dogs and special equipment to hunt for survivors, donated blood and money and offered their expertise. A <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> man donated a $ 15,000 sports car he won in a radio contest. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> remembered the help it received from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> firefighters in the 1988 fires at Yellowstone National Park. Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> asked emergency officials to help with structural inspections and search and rescue. `` While we are few in number and they are many, their needs are many, and we stand ready to help in any way,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> sent a mass feeding van to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> from Casper to join other <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> units delivering hot food door to door. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> also took cash donations for the relief effort. <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials said about a dozen staff members and volunteers were still on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> helping victims of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, but one person is preparing to head to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` It's been the double whammy,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> McQuillan </PERSON> said. `` We're still trying to raise money to pay for <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> and now we need money for this.'' The international headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nazarene </ORGANIZATION>, located in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, told its churches to pass the plate for earthquake victims at Wednesday night services. `` We're getting calls from all over, ` What are we going to do to help?' We tell them to get money,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, coordinator for the church's charity services. The Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> sent $ 35,000 to its American counterpart for earthquake victims. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a group of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> co-workers donated the $ 50 in a World Series betting pool to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, tens of thousands of Armenians met in the central square Thursday night to gather aid for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> quake victims, an activist said in a telephone interview. `` People came from all over, from factories, institutes, work collectives,'' said <PERSON> Galstyan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambartsumyan </PERSON>. `` We are collecting money, clothing _ we just have to find out what is needed. Soviet authorities say 25,000 people died in an earthquake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> last year, many of them when shoddily built multi-story apartment buildings collapsed. Aid flowed into the area from all over the world. The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> regional office of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, one of 10 nationwide, was unable to send help to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` I have all of my capability committed to <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>, the agency's division director of disaster assistance. `` I do n't really have anybody left to send out.'' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> crews who joined hurricane relief efforts in the <LOCATION> Carribean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> flew to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> also offered engineers to help assess the damage to buildings and bridges. `` As you determine your priority needs, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stands ready to assist in any way we can,'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said. People in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, had a special understanding of natural disaster. They're still digging out from Hugo, which smashed ashore on Sept. 21 with 135 mph wind. Relief poured in from across the nation. The city sent bottled water and gasoline generators to earthquake victims in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, as well as five police officers to help with emergency operations. `` I know we still have and will have great needs here and charity certainly begins at home. However, it would be wrong for this community ... not to reach in and contribute to those who are hurt and suffering right now,'' Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. Closer to home, an <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> brewery 35 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> filled cans with drinking water instead of beer for free shipment to relief agencies, the company said. The <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> said it will donate $ 2 million along with food, clothing and water. And a cellular telephone company in <LOCATION> Burlingame </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, offered to lend free telephones to emergency service agencies. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, lawyer <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Belli </PERSON> and his staff set up tables in front of his downtown offices Wednesday, offering free legal counsel. The attorneys' office building was apparently unsafe. The most unusual donation was probably from <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who won a <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miata </ORGANIZATION> sportcar in a name-that-tune radio contest in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> gave the car to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> earthquake fund. Morning disc jockey <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Dees </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> KIIS-FM </ORGANIZATION> management decided to match <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s $ 15,000 gift and awarded him another car _ demanding that he keep it. `` I still do n't know what I'm going to do,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> program director. `` I may yet give this one up, too. It's been a crazy day.'' Since <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s gift, people and businesses began calling the station wanting to donate money. A woman who lost the contest donated her $ 100 consolation prize, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, an assistant to <PERSON> Dees </PERSON>.

 Czechoslovak police arrested former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON> and 14 other activists, and briefly detained a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> human rights monitor, in a raid Thursday on an international human rights meeting in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. An emigre source said all the activists were freed by Thursday evening. It was the fourth such crackdown in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in recent days, indicating the communist government does not intend to follow <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> into genuine dialogue with opposition groups. Detained briefly was <PERSON> Jeri </PERSON> <PERSON> Laber </PERSON>, an American who directs <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, a group associated with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Laber </PERSON>, the only foreign national involved, was released after a document check. Dissident playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and another leading activist, <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Maly </PERSON>, escaped because those detained shouted warnings to them to flee, the federation said. Rude Pravo, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily, has said anyone taking part in street demonstrations to mark the anniversary Oct. 28 of Czechoslovak independence in 1918 faces prosecution. At least five activists are in prison awaiting trial on charges that could mean up to 10 years in jail. Dozens of others face similar charges and almost constant harassment. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s security forces have waged a campaign of carefully targeted repression following mass anti-government protests in January, detaining key activists and jailing lesser-known figures whose arrest stirs less protest at home and abroad than the trial earlier this year of <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>. The federation said uniformed and plainclothes police raided a <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> cafe where representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> were to meet federation leaders and Ms. <PERSON> Laber </PERSON>. Among those detained were banned writer <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanturkova </PERSON> and philosopher <PERSON> Radim </PERSON> <PERSON> Palous </PERSON>, and fellow Charter 77 activists <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Lis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Battek </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Palous </PERSON>. The raid came two days after five members of the <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, including <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON>, were questioned by police after leaving a meeting. On Wednesday, Czechoslovak TV and emigre sources reported five little-known activists with another independent group, the <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION>, have been charged with subversion. That could put them in jail for up to three years. Two of the five are still in custody following their detention Oct. 13, the emigre sources said. Last week, independent journalists <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruml </PERSON>, editors of the popular underground monthly Lidove Noviny, were arrested and charged with incitement, which carries a five-year jail sentence. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> demanded authorities release <PERSON> Ruml </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zeman </PERSON>, saying their only crime was `` to pursue the cause of freedom of expression.'' In addition, a leading rights and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> activist in the Slovak capital of <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON>, has been in detention since August on charges that could jail him for up to 10 years.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> said Thursday that a new group will soon be formed to better coordinate black organizations' efforts to pull other blacks out of the underclass. He said the group, which has no name yet, will be a clearinghouse for ideas that the many black oriented and controlled organizations can use to fight poverty, teen-age pregnancy, drugs, AIDS, crime and other problems that are dragging down a large segment of the population. `` I happen to believe the might of the black community is large enough'' to do something about these problems, the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> said at a press conference. `` Not counting the churches, there are 2 million black people in organized groups,'' he said. He said he envisions a `` war on poverty using sweat and tears'' of volunteers. However, he said, `` We do n't intend to let the federal government off the hook.'' At a three-day meeting starting Oct. 29, billed a `` conference on the present crisis,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> will form the new group and make plans to lobby <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for legislative relief from recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions viewed as setbacks to civil rights.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>, a Spanish writer whose violent, grotesque images sprang from the civil war that killed more than 1 million of his countrymen, won the Nobel Prize for literature Thursday. The Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> cited <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>, 73, for `` rich and intensive prose, which with restrained compassion forms a challenging vision of man's vulnerability.'' It said his novel `` The Family of <PERSON> Pascual </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>,'' published in 1942, was the most popular work of fiction in Spanish since <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cervantes </PERSON>' masterpiece `` Don Quixote'' was published nearly 400 years ago. `` I understand that this is the culmination of my literary career after many years of work,'' <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> told Swedish radio from his home in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, 30 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. `` I offer it to all of literature in Spanish. I believe that other authors, Spanish and Latin American, who write in Spanish could also have won it for the same reasons as I.'' <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>, a bon vivant known in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for his flamboyant lifestyle, told reporters over lunch in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> that `` life is like a game of tennis, and this time I won.'' He said he would use the $ 463,000 prize `` to pay my debts, and believe me, I've got a lot of them.'' In the 47 years since `` <PERSON> Pascual </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> said, `` what I have gained in wisdom I've been losing in vigor and health, and what I have gained in experience I've lost in freshness.'' As an epitaph, he said, he would like: `` Here lies someone who tried to screw his fellow man as little as possible.'' His 10 novels and 60 other works _ short stories, essays, poetry and travel books _ have made <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> `` the leading figure in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s literary renewal during the postwar era,'' the Swedish Academy said He is the fifth Spanish writer to receive the literature prize. <PERSON> Sture </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, the academy's secretary, said <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> also had wide influence on literature throughout <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` He is an experimental and provocative writer, both regarding form and contents,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` Furthermore, he broadened the range of the Spanish language.'' Asked to compare <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> with another experimental Spanish writer, <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> described both as individualists who were `` apparently acquainted with each others' works.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> suggested that readers unfamiliar with <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> begin with travel writings in which `` he tried to capture the <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> he saw disappearing, and maybe some of the Spanish national spirit.'' In `` The Family of <PERSON> Pascual </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>,'' his best-known work, <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> created a new style known as `` tremendismo'' that emphasized violence and grotesque imagery. The novel, a first-person account of a murderer awaiting execution, was banned in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> but established <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>'s reputation as a writer. `` Requiem of Darkness 5'' -LRB- 1973 -RRB- and `` Mazurka for Two Dead'' -LRB- 1983 -RRB- carried <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>'s experimental style further. His masterpiece is considered to be `` The Hive,'' published in 1951. It describes three days in the life of <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> four years after the civil war ended in 1939. The war, which lasted three years and brought Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> to power, often played an important role in <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>'s works. He is a native of <LOCATION> Galicia </LOCATION>, a Franco stronghold in northwestern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. After returning from studies in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> with tuberculosis, he was recruited by the fascists, suffered the horrors of war and was sent home with serious wounds. Despite his service in the Franco forces, <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> was strongly anti-fascist. From 1956 to 1979, he published <ORGANIZATION> Papeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Son </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armadans </ORGANIZATION>, a magazine that became a forum for the young opposition. <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> died in 1975. The author was born May 11, 1916, in the town of <LOCATION> Ira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flavia </LOCATION> to a middle class family that counted among its forebearers both <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> aristocrats and English pirates. Before the civil war began in 1936, he studied medicine and law. He turned to writing full-time after the success of `` The Family of <PERSON> Pascual </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>.'' In 1977, King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> to a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat in the first post-Franco parliament, and he participated the next year in writing a new constitution. He received the Prince of Asturias Award for Literature in 1987 and has been a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> literary group since 1957. <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> is the first Spaniard to win the literature prize since the poet <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleixandre </PERSON> in 1977 and the first Spanish-language writer since <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in 1982. The other winners from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> were poet <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> in 1956 and playwrights <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Echegaray </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacinto </PERSON> <PERSON> Benavente </PERSON> in 1904 and 1922. The Nobel Prize in literature was the last of the six prizes awarded for 1989, each worth $ 463,000. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, exiled spiritual and political leader of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, won the Nobel Peace Prize. Other winners were <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, medicine; <PERSON> Trygve </PERSON> <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, economics; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cech </PERSON>, an American, and Canadian-born <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen since 1984, chemistry; <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dehmelt </PERSON>, both Americans, and <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, West German, physics. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, who invented dynamite and made a fortune, provided for the prizes in his will.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday gave overwhelming approval to an $ 837 million aid package for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> that nearly doubles what President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has requested. The vote of 345-47 sent the measure to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` The ice of the Cold War is rapidly melting,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., during debate `` We have a unique opportunity to seize a very special moment in history. With our help, the march of freedom in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will become irreversible.'' The package was brought to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor with unusual speed, just 15 days after it was introduced. The urgency was an indication of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' eagerness to swiftly reward <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for their moves toward democracy and free-market economic reform, as well as Democrats' desire to underscore what they call <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` timid'' response to the sweeping changes in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> `` The administration has failed to grasp that this is a critical turning point in the history of <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> relations,'' said <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, a senior member of the chamber's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leadership. The package has a three-year price tag of $ 837.3 million, compared to the $ 450 million <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has sought. During a trip to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in July, the president originally proposed about $ 150 million in aid, and has ratcheted the amount upward since then in the face of congressional criticism. House Republicans flocked to the bill. One, Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, said the bill was `` an extraordinarily cheap way of helping redirect the course of history.'' The situation clearly has made administration officials uncomfortable. In a policy statement, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said it would generally support the bill but `` has reservations about the excessive funding levels'' and would work to decrease the amount when the bill goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Included in the package were: _ A $ 200 million grant to help stabilize <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economy That would be the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contribution to a $ 1 billion multilateral fund sought by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. _ $ 160 million for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and $ 40 million for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to promote private enterprise. _ $ 10 million to set up a technical training program in business skills for Poles and Hungarians, plus $ 4 million for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and $ 1 million for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for programs in job training, labor-management relations and occupational health and safety. _ Up to $ 125 million in food aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> _ $ 200 million in short-term guarantees and insurance for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters selling products to the two countries. _ $ 30 million for clean coal-burning technology for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and $ 10 million for other environmental protection programs for both countries. In addition, the bill provided $ 12 million for building democratic institutions in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, possibly through the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, and money for the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, cultural exchanges, scientific projects and medical aid. In an ironic twist, the bill uses some of the money aimed at helping the Solidarity government, an estimated $ 37.5 million, to subsidize <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> maritime unions, because it requires that 75 percent of food aid be shipped on more expensive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vessels. An effort to trim that subsidy, mostly pressed by farm-state lawmakers, failed 228 to 170. Last June, in the first open elections in four decades, candidates of the trade union <ORGANIZATION> Solidrity </ORGANIZATION> won enough seats to take control of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s government. A week ago, the new government outlined plans for sweeping economic reforms. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> this year became the first <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nation to physically dismantle the Iron Curtain and opened its borders to allow East Germans to flee to the West. It is developing a new multi-party political system under a liberalized constitution and plans parliamentary elections early next year. But serious problems in both countries pose a threat to the reforms. With inflation running at an annual rate of 200 percent and climbing, food shortages, and a $ 39 billion foreign debt burden, leaders of the fledgling Polish government face particularly crucial tests. The aid package will help relieve economic pressures and buy time for the new leaders to institutionalize their reforms, proponents said, and keep alive the prospects for change in the rest of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Citizens in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> are watching what is happening in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, said Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` If these experiments fail, it will stifle the prospects for political and economic reform in the other countries,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> buried his face in his hands, sobbing as he sat grief-stricken Thursday on a curb outside the rubble of a four-story apartment building where two of his friends died in the earthquake. `` I came here and it was gone. It happened so fast,'' said <PERSON> Lai </PERSON>, 26, who learned of the deaths when he came to check on their building. For him, like other Californians, the earthquake not only jumbled a landscape but heaved up grief and misery that clashed with a laid-back lifestyle. Damage was heaviest in the <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district, a trendy, upscale neighborhood of pastel buildings, stucco facades and terra-cotta roofs with a view of the spires of the Golden Gate Bridge and the mountains across <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pablo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, drenched on Thursday with the golden <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> sunshine. One section of the Bay Bridge linking <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> caved in, giving it the look of an alligator with its jaw stuck. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciscans </LOCATION> whose lives revolve around their cars endured clogged or closed freeways and city traffic snarled by non-working traffic lights. Other changes were less subtle. Joggers whizzed past carcasses of collapsed buildings without breaking stride. Tanned people in athletic wear toted tennis rackets and bought fruit juice chilled in ice buckets. Skateboarders and bicyclists competed with cars on streets. But the air carried the scent of leaking natural gas and sounds of sirens, generators, heavy equipment, helicopters and crackling police radios. Evacuees carrying coolers, suitcases and boxes of belongings competed for sidewalk space with tourists hefting video cameras and snapping pictures. `` It's bad enough we're going through what we are without the picture-taking. The tourists think this is a carnival,'' said <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaja </PERSON>, 71, sitting on a curb outside a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelter where she spent the night. She carried a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> bag filled with essentials, including lipstick and an emery board. One woman openly and randomly admonished those viewing the wreckage. `` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> has survived another earthquake. We've come through. We're not a city of kooks or something that falls apart. We are survivors,'' said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, talking loudly to no one in particular. On Chestnut Street, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Pallari </PERSON> set up his own emergency kitchen to feed neighbors with leftovers from his restaurant, the O Sole <LOCATION> Mio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pizzeria </LOCATION>. Cooking was done on a gas grill and a charcoal fire, and the menu ranged from bacon and eggs to soup and French bread. `` My refrigeration was gone, so it was either throw it away or give it away. I could n't save it,'' said <PERSON> Pallari </PERSON>, 42, operating from the back of a pickup truck in an alleyway. Sanitation workers shoveled debris into garbage trucks, including bricks and concrete shaken from buildings. The people who were ordered from their <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district homes because of the fear of leaking gas did what they could to get back to normal. <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> <PERSON> Gale </PERSON>, who was staying at a hotel that still lacked electricity, put her name on a waiting list for hot water so she could wash her hair. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Braden </PERSON>, 38, was on his way to his law office with the clothes he was wearing Tuesday _ surfer T-shirt, gray sweat pants and brown dress shoes. `` My boss told me to come in with whatever I was wearing,'' <PERSON> Braden </PERSON> said. In a gas station parking lot, <PERSON> Nita </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> sold $ 10 T-shirts that said, `` Earthquake Survivor, 5:04 p.m. Oct. 17, 1989, the time and day that the quake hit. Ten hours after that time she had 1,000 printed up. `` It was the biggest earthquake since 1906, so we wanted to mark the occasion,'' she said. Pubs and taprooms stayed open despite lack of refrigeration and ice. At Bachelors II, bartender <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> stored dirty glasses in boxes because he had no water to wash them. He served cocktails and beer over ice in foam cups. At a nearby tavern, patrons drank by candlelight and toasted their survival. `` We're glad were all here,'' said bartender <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON>. `` Some of our homes may be a shambles, but they can be replaced. Life ca n't.''

 A coalition of <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> from five <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries met Thursday with major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> environmental groups to demand inclusion in consideration of the conservation of the world's largest rainforest and the safeguarding of their native lands and rights. `` The time has come for the indigenous people of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>, the people who have always lived there, to take a place at the table as well,'' said <PERSON> Evaristo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nugkuag </PERSON>, president of the coalition known by its Spanish acronym COICA. Representatives of the countries _ <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> _ have also met this week with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to demand that development programs undertaken by these institutions be coordinated with the native inhabitants. <PERSON> Wilfrido </PERSON> <PERSON> Aragon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aranda </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> said indigenous people had been expelled from their lands to make way for hydroelectric projects, because Latin American governments do not respect Indian rights. `` We told them that we are now organized and we want them to deal directly with us, and also to press our governments to comply with protection laws of our rights,'' he said. Noted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> environmentalists, including <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovejoy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, promised to respond to the Indians' concerns and to lobby for their rights `` We're deeply grateful for this initiative,'' <PERSON> Lovejoy </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bramble </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> said her organization would lobby the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and other institutions to make sure they deal directly with the Indians on development projects. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has begun focusing attention this year on conservation projects, after being accused of environmental destruction through development projects such as road and dam construction in the Third World. World attention has been increasingly turned to the destruction of the 2 million square-mile <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> forest, mainly through burning, for farming, ranching, highway building and mining. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and other bodies have proposed so-called `` debt for nature swaps,'' in which they would use some of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s $ 112 billion debt to invest in <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> protection programs. But <PERSON> Nugkuag </PERSON> rejected the idea, saying the Indians of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> have never received money from their governments and had not contributed to the debt problem. `` But still, they're talking about giving away our lands to pay their debts,'' he said. Instead, he suggested, environmentalists should swap debt for projects protecting indigenous lands and peoples, which would be the best guarantee of the forest's conservation, as well. `` The focus of concern of the environmental community has been the preservation of the tropical forests and its plants and animal inhabitants,'' said a statement issued by the group. `` You have shown little interest in its human inhabitants.'' A second meeting to discuss specific ways of advancing the goals adopted at Thursday's meeting will be held next year in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, organizers said.

<TEXT>
 Unlike <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s four other Nobel laureates in literature, <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> is a public figure, better known as a bon vivant than for his 10 novels and other writings. His best-known novels, `` The Family of Pascual Duarte'' -LRB- 1942 -RRB- and `` The Hive'' -LRB- 1951 -RRB-, have been made into successful movies, and many Spaniards have encountered the author during his trips through the country in a Rolls <PERSON> Royce </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>, 73, most recently made news with the public disclosure of a romantic liaison with <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> Castano </PERSON>, a woman half his age who is his muse and literary aide. He is separated but not divorced from his wife of many years and has a son, <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>, who said last week that having such a flamboyant father was difficult. His wife, <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Conde </PERSON>, said Thursday from her home in <LOCATION> Palma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Majorca </LOCATION> the prize was well deserved and she would accompany her husband to the awards ceremony in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>. She added: `` If I do n't go, there's no prize.'' Before he rushed off to a weekly television talk show appearance Thursday, the Nobel laureate and Ms. <PERSON> Castano </PERSON> spoke with reporters over a quick lunch at a <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> hotel. She said he still writes everything in longhand and has no idea how to operate a typewriter or word processor. <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>, who has produced 70 works that include essays, poems and travel books, said he was `` not really surprised'' by the award and the prize could just as well have gone to many other Spanish writers. `` But life is like a game of tennis, and this time I won,'' he said, adding that the $ 463,000 prize would `` come in very handy.'' `` I'll use it to pay my debts, and believe me, I've got a lot of them,'' he said. <PERSON> Andreu </PERSON> <PERSON> Teixedor </PERSON> of Editorial Destino, which publishes <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>'s work in Spanish, said `` The Family of Pascual Duarte'' had sold more than 1 million copies in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> In the 47 years since `` <PERSON> Pascual </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> said Thursday, `` what I have gained in wisdom I've been losing in vigor and health, and what I have gained in experience I've lost in freshness.'' Using the crude language common to his fiction, <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> said he would like this epitaph: `` Here lies someone who tried to screw his fellow man as little as possible.'' The author said <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, which produced `` <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Quixote </PERSON>,'' had been overshadowed in literature by <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because of the country's `` foolish provincialism.'' `` The Family of Pascual Duarte'' often is credited with creating a sort of literary vanguard in the years immediately after the civil war of 1936-39. It was published first in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> because it was deemed too violent and crude for the <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> of Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>. It is the tale, told in graphic language, of a rude man from the country who commits a series of brutal murders without really knowing why and eventually is executed by garrote. His novel `` The Hive'' is set in the years just after the war, when the rest of the world was fighting. It tells of struggling writers who sit for hours during the winter in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s tolerant, well-heated literary cafes, nursing a cup of imitation coffee and trying to keep culture alive. <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>, the first Spanish novelist to win the Nobel, said Thursday he had a work in progress, but he would not describe it. `` You never really know how these things are going to turn out until the end,'' he said. Spanish poet <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> won the Nobel literature prize in 1956 and in 1977, two years after <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> died, it went to <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleixandre </PERSON>, an obscure poet. The nation's first literary laureate was playwright <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Echegaray </PERSON> in 1904 and another playwright, <PERSON> Jacinto </PERSON> <PERSON> Benavente </PERSON>, won in 1922.

 Farmers have developed conservation plans for 133 million acres of highly erodible cropland, about 98 percent of the goal, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the goal is to have plans drawn up on all the eligible land by the Dec. 31 deadline. Under the 1985 farm law, farmers must be actively applying a conservation plan on their highly erodible fields by the beginning of the 1990 calendar year and have that plan fully implemented by Dec. 31, 1994, if they want to stay eligible for <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> farm program benefits.

 The interior minister on Thursday called <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> a liar and said the maverick Communist concocted a phony tale of his own kidnap and attempted assassination apparently to help his political popularity. `` He invented the entire story,'' said Interior Minister <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> at a hastily called news conference. `` What the reason was, I do n't know. You should ask him.'' <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON>, the top Soviet policeman, said that by exposing the populist lawmaker's alleged falsehood and rumors it spawned, `` we have simply prevented a new outburst of popularity for <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. It was the lastest twist in <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s remarkable career, which has seen him ousted from his post as the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1987, only to stage a stunning comeback in legislative elections this year. The interior minister spoke less than 24 hours after <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> issued a statement accusing his former mentor, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, of staging a nationally televised `` political farce'' to scuttle his political career. Before the cameras of state-run TV on Monday, <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> told the Supreme Soviet legislature that <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, an anti-establishment hero to millions of Soviets, appeared at a police post Sept. 28. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was dripping wet, and falsely reported that men in a car had abducted him, put a sack over his head and tossed him from a bridge into the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> said. When he was given the floor, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, 58, denied to fellow lawmakers that he had ever made a formal police report of such an incident or that an attack occurred. But he did not say whether he had approached a policeman informally with such a story. In his toughly worded statement Wednesday, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> called the glaring public exposure given his reputed claims `` a new attempt to ruin my health and to knock me out of the sphere of political struggle.'' He claimed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was responsible. <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON>'s rapid appearance before reporters showed the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> was eager to counter <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s accusations. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, a strapping, silver-haired Siberian who calls for an end to official privilege and a better life for the average Soviet, enjoys wide popular support, which seems to boom every time people here perceive he has been targeted for attack by officialdom. <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> claimed that if any lies were being told about the supposed kidnapping, they were coming from <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>. `` I stated only what Comrade <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told the policeman,'' <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> said. `` There was no attempt on his life. These rumors are false.'' He said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> `` lied publicly'' when he told his story to the Supreme Soviet, and a second time a day later when he issued the statement to the press accusing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of staging a farce. Pressed to say what lies <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> had told, <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> referred to the lawmaker's statement claiming <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> mixed `` truth and lies'' in his report to the Supreme Soviet on the investigation into the incident. He also said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s alleged story to police could n't possibly be true. `` We know the terrain,'' <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> said. `` One ca n't be thrown from the bridge into the water without suffering serious injuries. There's also the time factor _ one ca n't do all these things in one hour.'' He suggested <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> lied to police for political ends. `` This is my personal guess, and it's nothing but a guess, that this false declaration by Comrade <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was made on purpose: to distribute information of interest to him,'' <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> said. `` He tried to gain something by making those statements. Time will show how he succeeds.'' By puncturing the rumors sweeping <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that an attempt was made on <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s life, `` we are putting an end to unfounded rumors of political persecution,'' he said. However, evident official attempts in the past to discredit <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> have misfired badly. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, to which <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> belongs, launched an investigation into charges that his views violate the party line, but 89 percent of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> voters subsequently elected him to the new Soviet parliament in March. Last month, Pravda reprinted an article from an Italian newspaper that claimed <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> boozed and shopped his way through a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> speaking tour, but later had to print a public apology admitting the allegations were hearsay that could n't be documented. Thousands of Muscovites formed a chain on Gorky Street to show their support for <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who was named <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in December 1985 but fired less than two years later for criticizing the slow pace of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader's reforms. Asked if <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> would be prosecuted under Article 130 of the Soviet criminal code for allegedly filing a false police report, <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> said there were no such plans. Besides, he said, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s status as a lawmaker means his fellow legislators would have to sanction any criminal investigation of him

 After a round of public recriminations, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sought Thursday to smooth over its differences with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and denied the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was trying to steer him into negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, vowing not to yield on basic principles, this week questioned the strategy Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is following in trying to implement the prime minister's proposal for Palestinian elections. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> questions the need for an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> meeting with Palestinians in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> before the elections, seeing such a session as pre-empting the talks that would be held with elected <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in response, on Wednesday accused <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of hindering the attempt to arrange negotiations with what the department characterized as unhelpful and disappointing remarks. On Thursday, however, spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had sent a letter to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> `` that applauds our efforts and encourages us to keep them up.'' At the same time, she said: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not trying to get the Israelis to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. We are trying to get the Israelis and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> together behind the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> election proposal.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had already assured the prime minister that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would have to be `` satisfied'' with the composition of any <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also has supported <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s effort to negotiate the selection with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.

 A white-supremacist `` skinhead'' was sentenced to up to 20 years in prison Thursday for helping beat a black immigrant to death. <ORGANIZATION> Multnomah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redding </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> to 10 to 20 years on one count of first-degree manslaughter in the November slaying of <PERSON> Mulegta </PERSON> <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Redding </PERSON>'s law clerk, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghastin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON>, a 27-year-old Ethiopian, was killed near his home last November by three neo-Nazi racists, police said. <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> pleaded guilty Sept. 1 to the manslaughter charge, one count of first-degree assault and three charges of intimidation. He was sentenced to 10 years on the assault charge and five years each on two of the intimidation charges. The sentences were to run concurrently with the manslaughter sentence. One of the other men involved in the attack, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mieske </PERSON>, 23, admitted beating <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON> with a baseball bat, and pleaded guilty to murder. He was sentenced to life in prison June 5. The third man, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON>, 20, is awaiting trial. Police said the three were members of a neo-Nazi, white supremacist gang called East Side White Pride. <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> is a stronghold for white-supremacist gangs, according to a federal prosecutor. The skinhead subculture, so-called because its members sport severely short haircuts, originated in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in the 1960s.

<HEAD>Expect Higher Milk Prices, USDA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The farm price of milk has climbed steadily, meaning prices at the grocery store will climb briskly for the rest of 1989, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` Dairy markets are tight because of strong cheese sales, non-fat dry milk exports and weakness in milk production,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. `` However, the size of the price increases largely was determined by the time of events,'' the report said. `` Milk production unexpectedly collapsed at midyear, after commitments had been made for large exports of non-fat dry milk and after cheesemakers had decided to delay rebuilding of cheese stock until the flush season'' of higher milk production last spring. But analysts said that milk output probably will rise above year-earlier levels in 1990 and that `` seasonal easing'' should eliminate supply problems. `` Dairy prices will drop from this autumn's highs,'' the report said. `` By next spring, prices may be below a year earlier.'' The farm price of milk in 1989 may average `` slightly more than $ 1 above'' last year's $ 12.24 per 100 pounds, the report said. In 1990, the price may average below the 1988 level. `` Retail prices of milk and dairy products were slower to start rising than farm or wholesale prices. However, increases in retail prices will be brisk during the rest of 1989,'' the report said. `` For the first time in many years, rises in retail dairy prices will surpass those of all food or all -LRB- consumer -RRB- items.'' Consumer food prices overall are currently forecast by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to rise an average of 5 percent to 7 percent this year, compared with a 4.1 percent gain in 1988.

<TEXT>
 Three people wrongly convicted 14 years ago for an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombing walked free Thursday, while the government began an inquiry into police actions that led an appeals court to reverse the convictions. One other man cleared in the pub bombing case was taken to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> where his attorneys sought bail pending an appeal of an unrelated murder conviction. `` This is a very grave matter for all who care about justice,'' Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. The appeals court ruling climaxed years of effort by relatives, former government officials, church leaders and journalists to overturn the verdict, and focused new attention on two other bombing cases from the 1970s. The sentence of the four had been upheld in 1977 even though members of an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> gang made detailed confessions in the case. `` I've been in prison for 15 years for something I did n't do. I'm totally innocent,'' <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON> told cheering well-wishers outside the Old <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> following his release. `` If you're Irish, and you're arrested on a terrorist, political type of offense, you do n't stand a chance. You just do n't stand a chance,'' <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON> said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. The appeals court threw out the convictions of <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>, 35, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, 39, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 35, all of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, in the bombing of a pub in <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, on Oct. 5, 1974. All had been sentenced to life in prison. `` Thank God we've not got capital punishment,'' <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Scrivener </PERSON> told the court. The convictions of <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> for a pub bombing in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> suburb of <ORGANIZATION> Woolwich </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 6, 1974, were also reversed. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was arrested again and taken to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, where he had been convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a former British soldier. New evidence `` throws such doubt upon the honesty and integrity of a number of the <LOCATION> Surrey </LOCATION> officers investigating this case in 1974 that the Crown now feels unable to say that the convictions of any of the four are safe or satisfactory,'' <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Amlot </PERSON> of the Office of Public Prosecutions told the hearing. The prosecution case was based entirely on confessions `` and in particular on the integrity of the officers taking them,'' said <PERSON> Amlot </PERSON>, who disclosed evidence that five officers had altered documents, withheld evidence and `` seriously misled the court.'' Lord <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, the Lord Chief Justice, responded: `` In fact, they must have lied.'' Three of the five officers are still serving on the <ORGANIZATION> Surrey </ORGANIZATION> department. Two were suspended Wednesday, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Surrey </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy chief constable. <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said a third officer was hospitalized, and the other two are retired. An independent assessor will recommend financial compensation for the four, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. `` All the money in the world would not compensate for what my son has gone through the last 15 years,'' said <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, who then burst into tears. <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said the judicial inquiry, to be headed by retired appeals judge Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, would also examine the conviction of the `` Maguire Seven,'' including <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>'s late father, on explosives charges. That case developed from statements by <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON> that <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>'s aunt, <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON>, had manufactured bombs. She was convicted of possession of explosives, as was her husband, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, their sons, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON>. <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON> died in prison in 1980; the others have served their sentences. While expressing satisfaction that `` the system has the capacity to correct its own mistakes,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> said he believed a similar error was made in the conviction of six Irish men for two <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> pub bombings Nov. 21, 1974, in which 21 people were killed and 160 wounded. The convictions were upheld last year. `` The official admission that a miscarriage of justice can happen and does happen has major implications for other ... cases and in particular the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> six,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, chairman of a group supporting the six convicts. `` We've still got a long, hard slog, but we can now see the end of the road,'' said <PERSON> Breda </PERSON> <PERSON> Power </PERSON>, daughter of <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Power </PERSON>, one of the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> convicts. Eight days after the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> bombing, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passed the Prevention of Terrorism Act, allowing police to hold terrorism suspects without charge for 48 hours and, in some cases, five more days. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s conviction in the <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION> bombing was in one of the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> `` Diplock courts'' created in 1973, in which judges decide terrorism cases without juries. A 1986 study found that 89 percent of defendants in those courts pleaded guilty; of those who pleaded innocent, 57 percent were convicted. Before Surrey police were accused of mishandling the <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION> case, there were scandals of false confessions in the Kent and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> police forces. One officer was dismissed, two were suspended and several were disciplined.

 More than a third of hunting injuries occur not when one hunter shoots another but when careless, sleepy or even drunk hunters _ or their guns _ fall out of trees, according to a study released Thursday. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, which studies injuries as well as disease in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, reported the results of a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> study that found 36 percent of hunting injuries were mishaps involving tree stands, perches where deer hunters wait in concealment for their quarry. A tree stand can be anything from a hastily built platform to a store-bought, built-for-comfort tree chair. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> officials studied 594 deer-hunting-related injuries in the state over a decade; 214, including 17 deaths, involved tree stands. Fractures were common. `` This is just the tip of the iceberg,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, an epidemiologist with the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. `` The nature of the system is such that the only reports we get are the ones that are fairly serious.'' The study looked just at <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, but `` we're sure this is occurring in other states,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said, adding that `` no one had systematically looked into it.'' `` Most people hear of hunting accidents, they picture one person shooting another,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s State Hunter Safety Coordinator. But in recent years, he said, `` over 50 percent have involved tree stands. It's a serious problem.'' Most of the tree stand injuries involved falls; 111 hunters were hurt when they tumbled out of their stands, 49 fell while trying to climb down and 40 fell while trying to climb up. The average stand was 16 feet above the ground, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. Some hunters simply lost their balance, but others had stranger stories. One woman, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said, was hurt in a mishap involving both the tree she was hiding in and the deer she shot. The wounded deer charged toward her and crashed into the tree, shaking it and dislodging her from her stand. She broke a leg. Twenty-seven injuries _ and eight of the 17 tree stand fatalities _ occurred when weapons went off accidentally, either while being carried up and down the tree or on impact from a fall. Injuries were often serious; 156 hunters, or 73 percent, suffered fractures. Sixteen teen-age hunters suffered neck fractures and were paralyzed. Eleven hunters reported they had fallen asleep just before falling out. Eight hunters either admitted they were drunk or were suspected of it by game officials. And that number, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said, might be low. `` We could not assess the influence of alcohol or other substance abuse. ... Most of these hunters did not have blood-alcohol levels taken,'' he said. Some of the injured hunters were asked whether they had taken a hunting safety course; two-thirds had n't. And none of the 214 injured hunters were wearing safety harnesses or seat belts. Many mishaps could have been prevented, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said, if hunters had used safety harnesses, unloaded their guns while climbing up and down, used pull-up cords to hoist their weapons into their stands and checked the condition of their stands before climbing in. `` It's important that equipment be checked before you go up,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said.

 A chartered plane, a few helicopters and several hotels later, options dealers from the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> had a smooth day of trading Thursday at makeshift posts in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> markets. `` What we pulled off ... was no mean feat,'' said exchange spokesman <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. `` I just shipped 140 guys away from their families a day after the worst catastrophe in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> history.'' If Tuesday's quake was n't quite the worst catastrophe in the city's history _ that distinction still belongs to the 1906 earthquake _ the trading airlift was indeed a mean feat. It was an unprecedented logistical nightmare that involved carpenters, electricians, computer experts and the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Officials at the various exchanges said trading went smoothly. `` There were no hitches,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Moulds </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` Once they got oriented, it was an easy do.'' Stock trading continued Wednesday at the exchange in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, a day after the earthquake knocked out power and computers. Dealers worked by candle and flashlight, rerouting trades via phone through <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. But the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> exchange does n't trade options, so about 150 Pacific options traders and support staffers had to be moved east so investors could continue trading stock options listed solely on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> exchange. The timing was critical because of the looming expiration of October stock options. Friday is the deadline for investors to renegotiate the options, which let them buy or sell specific stocks at a specific price at a certain time. The exchange trades options in 130 stocks, with 70,000 contracts changing hands on an average day. Among big-name stocks that have options traded only on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> exchange are <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, building inspectors OK'd the trading floors Thursday, but <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said options traders would remain where they were through Friday. The marathon effort was sanctioned Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. At the American and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> exchanges, carpenters and electricians worked through the night on trading areas; at the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, computer experts laid extra cables and programmed computers to accept new issues. The <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> crews arrived by chartered jet shortly before dawn Thursday in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The jet headed for <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where some traders caught buses into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and others caught helicopters and limousines to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` They have n't slept in 24 hours, plus the trauma of the earthquake. Our hats are off to them,'' said <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> exchange President <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> trading began at the market's 8:30 a.m. CDT opening. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, extra time was needed for traders to arrive and get settled, and trading did n't begin until 1 p.m. EDT. The exchanges `` opened up their doors like good Samaritans,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kender </PERSON>, executive vice president of the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clearing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which clears all trades in options. `` The cooperation has been phenomenal.''

<HEAD>House, Senate Agree on $20,000 Payments for 60,000 Japanese-Americans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators endorsed on Thursday legislation guaranteeing $ 20,000 compensation payments to the estimated 60,000 living Japanese-Americans who were sent to internment camps in World War II. The compromise legislation, which could pay the former internees as much as $ 1.2 billion over three years, must now be be approved by both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before being sent to the White House for consideration by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has opposed the payments becuse of their cost. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not made his position known. The reparations payments are part of an overall $ 17.3 billion measure providing appropriations for the Commerce, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and Justice departments for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1. House negotiators accepted the Senate-passed version of the bill guaranteeing that all surviving internees will receive the payments. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 74-22 on Sept. 29 to waive budget restrictions and guarantee the reparations payments are made. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the bill, which the conference approved, bars any payments until the beginning of the fiscal 1991. But it then makes up to $ 500 million a year available over three years until all of the $ 20,000 reparations payments are made. The payments would be free of federal tax. The House version of the bill would have appropriated $ 50 million to be made available immediately but included no guarantees of any payments beyond that. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized the payments last year. Because of the budget crunch, however, no money was actually paid out.

 <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, a federally chartered mortgage agency, on Thursday offered a moratorium on foreclosures for homeowners whose properties were damaged by the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake. The agency, formally known as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, will permit the moratorium on single-family home mortgages until Jan. 1. Also, on a case-by-case basis, it will offer a temporary suspension or reduction in mortgage payments. `` We felt it necessary to move quickly in providing immediate relief. ... We are aware that many homeowners have inadequate or no earthquake insurance on their properties,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierson </PERSON>. Homeowners should contact their lenders to determine whether their mortgages were sold to the agency, which helps finance one in eight of American homes, she said. <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, which purchases mortgages from lenders, packages them into securities and resells them to investors, is offering a similar program to victims of Hurricane Hugo.

<HEAD>Program Halts Ancient River Blindness Scourge in Much of Africa</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 15-year assault on tiny parasites has halted an ancient scourge in much of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, sparing millions the threat of blindness, program director <PERSON> Ebrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Samba </PERSON> said Thursday. The Gambian physician, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Onchocerciasis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters: `` Of the 10 million people in danger when we started, none is at risk. Not one.'' Also, <PERSON> Samba </PERSON> said, thousands of miles of fertile riverbank land have been put back into use by farmers who had fled because of the disease. Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, is among the more dreaded of endemic diseases that afflict millions in the Third World but remain little known in developed countries. Worldwide, `` oncho'' affects an estimated 80 million people in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, tropical <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and parts of southern <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. It causes vicious, relentless itching followed by blindness or death. <PERSON> Samba </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> meeting to brief donors on the program. Operations began in 1974, administered by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and supported by 20 donors. The program focused on the worst-hit area, seven countries of the <LOCATION> Volta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> basin in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. A million people there suffered from oncho at the time, and nearly 100,000 were blind. Since then, the program added four neighboring countries. By 1991, it will have cost $ 300 million, with the biggest contributions from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. A final monitoring phrase is planned until 1997. Samba estimated 90,000 people would have gone blind since 1974 and a million children would have been exposed without the program. `` Transmission has stopped for five years,'' he said. `` It is under control.'' Teams worked in villages inured to the daily routine of small children leading around sightless elders. In parts of <PERSON> Burkina </PERSON> <PERSON> Faso </PERSON>, one infant in five could expect to be blind by age 30. `` On a continent where the average annual income is $ 300, you can imagine how serious it is to be blind,'' <PERSON> Samba </PERSON> said. Oncho is carried by microscopic larvae transmitted in the bite of river-bred black flies. When operations started, farmers were being bitten up to 1,000 times a day during the rainy season. In the human body, larvae grow into threadlike worms, lumped in nodules that itch so badly they can drive victims to suicide. They attack the eyes and a buildup of dead worms causes blindless. Eradication teams in small planes and helicopters ranged along 11,000 miles of rivers, spraying weekly during wet seasons. New resistant strains emerged, forcing changes in larvacides. Borne by westerly winds, flies traveled 400 miles a day from unsprayed areas. To stop reinfestation, the program was expanded from 295,000 square miles to 502,000 square miles. Teams treat victims with a new drug, ivermectin, donated by <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rahway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, which controls young worms. Adult worms defy all medicines, living up to 18 years. Ivermectin requires at least one dose yearly. It can not prevent infestation. But, <ORGANIZATION> Samba </ORGANIZATION> said, its use has sharply cut back blindness and other debilitating effects. Samba has spent almost as much time at politics as disease control across a wide region where conflicts sometimes erupt in gunfire. After the brief war between <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Burkina </PERSON> <PERSON> Faso </PERSON> in 1985, his were the first civil aircraft back in the air. `` Often Cabinet ministers have relatives, mothers and fathers, who suffer from oncho,'' Samba said. `` They understand the urgency on a personal level.'' He acknowledged that program methods could not be easily applied elsewhere in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because the flies were scattered over too wide an area. `` But elsewhere, this is not so acute a problem,'' he said. The program includes <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Burkina </PERSON> <PERSON> Faso </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guinea-Bissau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Florent </PERSON> <PERSON> Agueh </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> officer for the region, called the program a model for aid to developing countries. `` After 15 years, enthusiasm among donors and recipients is as strong as ever,'' he said. `` In the world of development, persistence is usually what is most lacking.''

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and Cardinal <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> led 15,000 mourners Thursday at an anniversary Mass for the Rev. <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON>, a popular priest slain by the secret police five years ago. Many of the 259 Solidarity members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> attended the 90-minute outdoor evening service at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanislaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kostka </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON>'s former parish in a residential neighborhood of northern <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. Dozens of buses that brought workers from around the country lined the street in front of the church. Hundreds of candles flickered on the sidewalks surrounding the grounds. Scores of banners proclaimed representatives of factories and Solidarity chapters throughout <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. One banner near the grave said: `` <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON>, today we collect the fruit of your suffering.'' <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON> supported workers in the difficult years after the declaration of martial law Dec. 13, 1981. Pro-Solidarity demonstrations and clashes with security police have marked previous anniversaries of his death. He became a symbol of Solidarity's struggle for recognition. Foreign leaders, such as Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, visited his grave. <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, the Roman Catholic primate of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, said in his sermon: `` After five years, the nation remembers the brave chaplain and will remember. Father <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> believed, and spread this belief, that time would come for the victory of truth.'' <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> put <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON> in the pantheon of great Poles, such as composer <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Chopin </PERSON>, who died in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> 140 years ago this week. The crowd warmly welcomed a delegation from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which, like <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, has set a course away from communism and toward democracy. `` We'd like to put into practice in our country, in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, what <PERSON> Father </PERSON> <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON> was teaching us,'' said a Hungarian priest accompanying the group. He told the Poles an exhibition on <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON> opened in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> this month, and asked for prayers for the Hungarian Roman Catholic church. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> went to <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON>'s grave for a silent prayer before the Mass, but did not speak at the service. Political life in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has dramatically changed this year. Not only has Solidarity been made legal again, but a former Solidarity editor is prime minister of the first non-Communist government in the Soviet bloc. State radio and television, now directed by a Solidarity member, carried a range of programs about <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON>, including comments by his mother and an interview with his former driver. Three secret policemen abducted the priest Oct. 19, 1984. Ten days later, his bound and gagged body was pulled from the freezing <LOCATION> Vistula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The three policeman and their commanding officer were convicted of murder in February 1985. Testimony at the trial indicated <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON> was killed because of his activities in defense of workers dismissed or jailed for supporting Solidarity. One of the convicted policeman has been released under a reduced sentence, but the others remain in prison.

 By train, by boat and by car, commuters struggled to reach work Thursday following the deadly quake that closed the vital bridge linking <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> and the rest of the East bay. A 50-foot section of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> collapsed during Tuesday evening's quake, which measured 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. Many commuters found themselves stuck in traffic jams. Others arrived at buildings still in the dark or with only partial power. Others turned back after facing up to four-hour delays on the overburdened highways. `` People are just trying to get back to reality, to make life like it was before,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomberlin </PERSON> of Traffic Central, a private traffic information service. Many city residents biked or walked to work, and at least one businessman roller-skated down from Twin Peaks. Commuters from the south faced up to a four-hour delay, compared to the average hour-long drive, according to <PERSON> Tomberlin </PERSON>. People trying to reach work from <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> counties to the north faced delays of up to 90 minutes. In the populous southern half of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, freeways jammed up in both directions from <LOCATION> Hayward </LOCATION> in the east to <LOCATION> Gilroy </LOCATION> in the west. Traffic in the northern, less-populated part of the nine-county region was lighter. But in some areas, particularly for eastbound commuters heading from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> counties, traffic was backed up for several miles. In some highway stretches, several of them stretching for 10 miles, traffic was stop-and-go at maximum speeds of 5 mph. The <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> system restored full operations for the Wednesday morning commute, but spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> said the passenger load _ typically about 50,000 people each way on weekdays _ was slightly below normal early in the commute. But trains were standing-room only by mid-morning, hours past the traditional rush hour. The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION>, the city's bus, cable car and trolley system, normally carries 800,000 passengers daily. The system was 30 percent below normal, according to spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON>. The passenger load on buses and ferries operated by the Golden Gate Transit system from north of the city was about half normal, officials said. About 3,000 commuters arrived in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> by boat. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hornblower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> offered trips to the <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> waterfronts, where ferries do n't normally stop.

 It was now you see it, now you do n't for the female form in Thursday's ready-to-wear fashion shows for next summer. Japanese designers and others swathed their models in loose, smooth and sometimes transparent fabrics that suggested the body without emphasizing it. After two seasons of `` normal'' clothes, <PERSON> Rei </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawakubo </PERSON> at Comme <PERSON> des </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcons </PERSON> in particular reverted to some of her old layering and asymmetrical tricks. <PERSON> Kawakubo </PERSON>'s designs suggested a circus _ starting with a big group of white blousons, bubble skirts and shorts _ with a hole carved out of one jacket sleeve at the shoulder, a typical <PERSON> Kawakubo </PERSON> signature touch. Some Comme <PERSON> des </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcons </PERSON> items looked like true <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> fashion; others were a mess, including bunched-up prints clinging to the body and hitched up to one side to look self-consciously offhand. Besides her usual black and white, <PERSON> Kawakubo </PERSON> went in for some blinding neon shades of pink, green and yellow bright enough to stop traffic on <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>. An off-white, long `` cool wool'' coat with little points at the shoulders was quite handsome. Another original idea was pairing fencers' tunics with wide cuffed shorts and long lean pants for a smooth layered look. People with a figure problem might appreciate the wide-flowing sheer cotton dresses printed in `` passementerie'' flowered bands or plaids. And the black tent dresses edged in gold chains were another good solution for the weight-watching set. For evening, she suggested women turn into disco decor _ in black and white viscose gowns with square mirror toppings. <PERSON> Yohji </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON>'s long satin vests and baggy pants in navy or black-and-white combinations looked typical of the Japanese creator. His sober layered looks command a big following though they're no longer in the avant-garde. <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> varied his usual menu of dreary black with lots of welcome color, starting with a loose tangerine satin viscose apron worn over a clinging black body suit. Transparent voile cottons flowing over black underneath gave a lighter appeal to his severity. <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> showed some wonderful stiffened dark gray mid-calf skirts gathered like cartridge pleats with clinging black tops. But just to emphasize female curves, he brought out dresses with plumped-up bodices to puff up the bosom over skirts with padded ridges. Another designer to hail the female bust was <PERSON> Jean-Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Castelbajac </PERSON>. He brought out some molded latex flesh-colored tops with every anatomical detail in place, topping them with a rainbow of multi-colored sheer cotton duster jackets over wide long pants in hot hues like orange, raspberry, yellow and emerald. The new fabrics in shorts, big jackets and long pants included neutral tones of a corrugated and textured silk-like fabric. Hand-painted gzar and canvas were always in the strong color and simple themes Castelbajac loves, and red-navy-white combinations of felt and linen came out in all versions of sailor styles. For beachcombers wanting to hide from the sun he showed some full-skirted silvery linen outfits topped by floppy straw sunhats as big as a beach umbrellla. After many years as a structural designer, showing clothes based on menswear, <PERSON> Nino </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerruti </PERSON> loosened up considerably with a flowing liquid silhouette for a casual but sophisticated woman. After some strict pastel suits for power dressing, he brought out a big range of long and flowing outfits in soft neutral tones of glen plaids, solids like dusty pink and gray-blue. His silhouette was always lean, under very long and rounded lapels or wide and floppy lapels, the white blouse collars showing on top. <PERSON> Thierry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugler </PERSON> always exaggerates the female form, and this time was no exception. Besides some hot wrapped-print sarong looks, he molded bodies in plenty of outfits with a campy-sexy cartoon appeal, and even decked out one model in the trappings of a loud 1950s hot-rod, with bumper-bullet bosoms, chrome trim and all.

<HEAD>Two Medellin Cartel Colombians Captured in Mexico</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Mexican authorities have captured the nephews of two major Colombian drug kingpins and broken up a ring that flew cocaine into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and shipped it by boat to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, authorities said Thursday. The Colombians were captured along with eight other men Sunday at a clandestine airstrip in the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, according to federal police commander <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON> <PERSON> Valverde </PERSON>, head of the narcotics interdiction forces. Two other men were captured in the resort city of <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, but one Colombian escaped in an airplane, <PERSON> Valverde </PERSON> said. The leaders of the Yucatan ring were <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, a nephew of <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Isunza </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, a nephew of <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Valverde </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, known as `` El Mexicano'' because of his fondness for things Mexican, are top members of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel and are among the world's most wanted drug traffickers. <PERSON> Valverde </PERSON> said <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Isunza </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> were their uncles' representatives in the smuggling operation When asked if the two might be extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Valverde </PERSON> said, `` Anything is possible.'' He said he did n't know what charges the two might be wanted on in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> or in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, nor if a U.S.-Colombia agreement under which drug traffickers can be extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would apply. Commander <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorrabaquio </PERSON> said the case was unrelated to recent large drug busts along the U.S.-Mexico border, including the seizure of nine tons of cocaine in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and 20 tons in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb. <PERSON> Lorrabaquio </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> ring brought cocaine in from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> by air, then shipped it by boat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, usually to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, while the cocaine seized along the border was probably being taken across by land. <PERSON> Valverde </PERSON> said the airplane carrying the drugs escaped when someone on the ground warned the pilot by radio that Mexican police were at the airstrip. He said authorities were looking into whether the drugrunners had any official or unofficial protection for their ground operations. `` We imagine they made an arrangement for protection,'' <PERSON> Valverde </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Valverde </PERSON> said that in spite of the situation in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, where drug-related violence has increased since the August assassination of a presidential candidate, there had been no threats against Mexican law enforcement officials over the seizure of <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Isunza </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Valverde </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Colombian authorities had no involvement in the three-month investigation and bust.

<TEXT>
 An ex-nurse charged with killing four hospital patients with lethal injections was a `` monster'' dressed in white who switched from mice to humans for experiments, a prosecutor said in opening arguments Thursday. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> was `` the living embodiment of your worst nightmare,'' Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Colins </PERSON> told the jury. `` He conducted uncontrolled experiments on knowingly terribly vulnerable human beings for his stated purposes of improving his image and reputation,'' <PERSON> Colins </PERSON> said. Police have said <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> admitted he injected patients at a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> hospital to put them on the brink of death so he could be the first on the scene to resuscitate them and look like a hero to his colleagues. <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>, 27, was a nurse for about six months in 1987 at <ORGANIZATION> Good </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Samaritan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, when four patients, ranging in age from 57 to 75, died within minutes of being injected with the muscle relaxant Pavulon. Three other patients survived Pavulon injections. The <LOCATION> Lindenhurst </LOCATION> man is charged with four counts of second-degree murder and three counts of assault. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Naiburg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>'s attorney, conceded that <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> injected the patients with the drug and that some of those patients may have died as a result of what he did. But he said <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> is not guilty of murder. He suggested a count of lesser homicide or assault. <PERSON> Colins </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> turned to humans after tiring of performing drug experiments on mice. `` To unsuspecting patients in the special care unit at <ORGANIZATION> Good </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Samaritan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, -LRB- <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> -RRB- was a monster dressed in nurse's whites,'' <PERSON> Colins </PERSON> said `` He was not content to stop after experimenting first with his mice and watching them die.'' One of those <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> is charged with assaulting, <PERSON> Gerolamo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON>, 75, testified that <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> asked him how he was feeling and then injected him with a paralyzing drug after saying, `` This will make you feel much better.'' `` I became like dead. ... I could n't move,'' said <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON>, who had been hospitalized after suffering a heart attack. `` I was thinking, how long is it going to last before I die?'' As <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON> testified, <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> sat at the defense table with his eyes downcast. <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON> said he pressed the emergency alarm and his regular nurse, <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, came in and helped revive him. Moments later, <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> returned to the room, but <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON> said he still could n't talk or see. He said he heard <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>'s voice and pointed toward the voice. According to <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>, `` What did you do?'' <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> answered, `` Nothing,'' and left the room.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge Thursday stayed the execution of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s longest death-row resident less than 12 hours before he was to go to the electric chair for killing a state trooper in 1977. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> granted <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON>, 30, the stay shortly after receiving <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON>'s latest appeal, saying the early Friday deadline gave him too little time to review it. <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> officials had been preparing the electric chair for use just after midnight. <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON> was in another section of the prison at a state <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> hearing, where friends and family pleaded for clemency. But the hearing was suspended after <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>'s ruling. On Wednesday, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to hear an appeal by <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON>, who was 17 when he shot trooper <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> to death after the officer stopped the car <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON> and his brother were in. The murder occurred only six months after <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON>'s release from a reform school, where he'd been sent for killing a taxi driver when he was 14. <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON> has been on death row 10 years, longer than any other <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> convict. Eight previous execution dates were canceled by state or federal courts. In his latest appeal, <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON>'s attorneys claim the prosecution systematically excluded blacks from the jury. No new date was set for the Pardon Board hearing. The board can recommend a more lenient sentence for a convicted killer. The recommendation must be acted on by the governor.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> spent 45 minutes Thursday with two terrorists he had pardoned, who told reporters the return of democracy had removed the need for the anti-government violence they advocated in the 1970s. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaca </PERSON> <PERSON> Narvaja </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Perdia </PERSON>, who until 12 days ago were fugitives in hiding outside the country, told a <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> news conference they had thanked <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> for the pardon and pledged to work for national reconciliation. `` There is no possibility ... of armed action when democratic institutions are in full force,'' said <PERSON> Vaca </PERSON> <PERSON> Narvaja </PERSON>, who promised to return ransom money his Montonero guerrillas extorted from kidnap victims. Norvaja, now 41 and in a jacket and tie, looked more like a middle-class professional than someone once accused of murder, kidnapping, assault, bombings, jailbreak, airplane hijacking and other crimes. Perdia, paunchy and pinstriped at 48, looked equally unlike a revolutionary whose actions helped bring on the military coup of March 1976 and the `` dirty war'' against suspected leftists that raged until the end of the decade. `` It is absolutely essential to think of and construct a future for the living, without forgetting the past,'' he said. On Oct. 7, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> pardoned 39 colonels, generals and vice admirals who faced trial for kidnapping, torture and murder in the disappearances and presumed deaths of 9,000 people during nearly eight years of military rule. The junta left power upon the election of lawyer <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> as president in 1983. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, a former provincial governor who succeeded <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> in July, also pardoned 64 guerrillas and indicated he soon would free <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Videla </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Viola </PERSON>, army generals who served as presidents of the military juntas and are in prison for human rights violations. Also on the potential pardon list is <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Firmenich </PERSON>, co-founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Montoneros </ORGANIZATION>, who is serving a 30-year sentence for murder. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s goal is to end a bloody chapter in Argentine history and concentrate on dealing with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s chronic inflation, a protracted recession and uncharacteristically high unemployment. The military has insisted since relinquishing power to <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> in December 1983 that it fought a kind of civil war against terrorists. Rights groups accuse the military of wholesale killing. Rights groups and leftist political organizations opposed the military pardons and say they hope to gather a million signatures on a petition for reversal. Opponents also called a demonstration for Friday outside the faded pink <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile two of the three largest political parties have endorsed the pardon, as has the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the largest newspapers and the most influential business and farm groups.

 Pro-democracy activists said on Thursday that the choice of <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> as <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s new leader could lead to protesters again filling the streets unless he belies his hard-line reputation and implements reforms. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> succeeded <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> on Wednesday and soon made clear in an address to the nation the communist party will resist the democratic trends evident in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. But he said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s refusal to recognize East German citizenship was an obstacle to expanding travel to the West. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday visited an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> factory and his encounter with workers, which touched on broad public dissatisfaction, was deemed by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> network `` unthinkable only a few weeks ago.'' Excerpts of the footage shown on <PERSON> Aktuelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamera </PERSON>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s main evening newscast, were carried by West German networks When asked by <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> why so many co-workers had fled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, metal worker <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Berus </PERSON> said: `` A lot of things kept adding up until some people felt there was just no alternative.'' Several workers complained of the rigid travel restrictions, which recently were expanded to include <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> after more than 53,000 East German refugeess streamed there to begin their treks West. The unusual presentation may reflect a willingness by <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> to allow more frank discussion of national problems in the state-controlled media. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> also met with <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Leich </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, for talks described by East German TV as `` open and constructive.'' <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday he wanted to improve relations between church and state. Also Thursday, the West German newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s state bank is selling for hard currency 100 million East German marks it holds in banks in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> said the bank acted because of `` a lack of confidence in -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s -RRB- internal stability'' and as a hedge against a possible revaluation of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s currency. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> officially pegs one East German mark equal to one West German mark. In reality, it is worth perhaps a fourth of that. A dollar now fetches about 1.85 West German marks. <PERSON> Reinhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schult </PERSON>, a founder of New Forum, the largest pro-democracy group in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said Thursday on <ORGANIZATION> RIAS </ORGANIZATION> radio of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, `` <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> stands for the continuation of neo-Stalinst politics.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> `` did not have one word to say about the causes of the current crisis and made no offer for talks with the opposition.'' Author <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a critic of the government, told RIAS: `` The crisis will keep dragging on.'' A Lutheran church leader said privately, `` The demonstrations will start again soon'' unless the government changes its course. The church has been in the forefront of reform efforts. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> urged <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> to make `` fundamental reforms.'' He said East Germans demand `` their basic rights.'' Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, a champion of reform, sent <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> a telegram expressing confidence he would `` respond to the demands of the time, following a course of renewal and continuity.'' In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the only Soviet bloc nation with a non-communist government, both pro-Solidarity and communist party newspapers described <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s departure as a welcome change. Newspapers in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which is moving rapidly from communism toward Western-style democracy, said <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> was seen as a `` transitional figure.'' Reform activists in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said 1,000 people peacefully protested in <LOCATION> Greifswald </LOCATION> hours after <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, 52, a protege of <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, was named leader. More than 120,000 pro-democracy protesters marched in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> on Monday. On Thursday, many residents of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> were skeptical about the leadership change. `` <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> just wants to calm us down,'' said a worker in his mid-20s. `` We'll have to see if there's going to be anything more than words this time.''

<TEXT>
 Another destructive earthquake has motivated <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Californians </ORGANIZATION> once again to plan ahead for the next one, but the rush for survival goods that accompanies such frightening episodes may be short lived. `` Every time something like this happens we get a surge, then it tapers off again,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> of the 11-store <ORGANIZATION> Sportmart </ORGANIZATION> chain, one of the region's largest sporting goods retailers. It's been two years since the quake in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Whittier </LOCATION>, which killed eight people, inspired residents to a concerted effort to prepare for a natural calamity. Since the 6.9-magnitude <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION> quake Tuesday night, the <ORGANIZATION> Sportmart </ORGANIZATION> stores have been overrun with customers buying water purifiers, portable toilets, stoves, lanterns, flashlights and food. `` This time, more than ever before, they are filling in with the real nitty-gritty stuff,'' said <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>. The television coverage of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake victims deprived of such basics as food and water has had a big impact, he said. `` Some of the items are selling tenfold, especially water purifying kits. Water is the biggest concern. The idea has been planted,'' said <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>. Experience has taught, however, that apathy will return. There was a mild response when the <ORGANIZATION> Sparkletts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drinking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> tried selling earthquake preparedness kits earlier this year. But the Bay Area quake jolted people into action, said <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefinton </PERSON> of the Sparkletts <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> office. `` We expect to do about 40 percent more business. We get a surge of business after every big earthquake,'' said <PERSON> Hefington </PERSON>. Consumers wo n't store items necessary for surviving an earthquake unless they are shaken up, he said. Although Sparkletts ended its earthquake kit advertising campaign in July, telephones orders began pouring in the day after the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area quake. The kit includes two cases of bottled water, a safety stove and a candle. Other quake preparedness items in demand were water heater straps and wrenches to shut down gas and water lines, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ainsworth </PERSON> of the Home Depot home improvement store in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>.

 Three strong aftershocks rattled a jittery <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Thursday, and rescuers who found fewer cars than feared under a collapsed freeway said the World Series may have reduced the rush-hour traffic. `` Maybe we got lucky because of the game,'' <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. `` Normally at 5 o'clock in the afternoon this area would be bumper-to-bumper. Maybe the World Series saved our lives.' <PERSON> Power </PERSON> and commuters returned to much of downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> as a tentative city tried to recover and regroup following Tuesday's earthquake, which claimed scores of lives and at least $ 2.87 billion in damage. Residents of the ravaged <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district, furious at initially being barred from their homes, later lined up for 15-minute passes to fetch clothing, medicine, food and belongings. At the 1 \ - mile stretch of the collapsed double-deck Interstate 880, the <ORGANIZATION> Nimitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>, workers cut holes in concrete and used cranes to pull out Rescuers reported finding the cars as far apart as 60 feet, rather than bumper-to-bumper as had been feared, Assistant Fire Chief <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigwart </PERSON> said. That could lower the death toll in the highway rubble _ estimated earlier at 253, authorities said. `` They are going lower, much lower in fact,'' <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Covington </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said of the estimates. `` What's happening is that they are finding fewer vehicles under the bridge than they thought.'' Firefighter <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Getreu </PERSON> said he had walked the length of the fallen highway and estimated no more than two dozen cars were trapped. No new official estimate of fatalities was made. Many people left work early to watch the third game of the World Series, scheduled to start at 5:30 p.m., and 60,000 people already were across the bay in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Candlestick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> when the quake struck at 5:04 p.m. The World Series will resume Tuesday at Candlestick Park in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said Thursday that only 85 people were officially reported missing. On Thursday morning, three aftershocks struck south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The first, measuring 5.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion, hit at 3:15 a.m. and was centered near <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, about eight miles from the epicenter of Tuesday's 6.9 quake, according to the state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Two other aftershocks measured 4.5. `` No one is really sleeping around here,'' <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> resident <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't stop shaking,'' said 73-year-old <PERSON> Marcelina </PERSON> <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON>. `` I guess I'm surviving, but I'm scared.'' Fifty-six people were treated at a <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> community clinic, mostly for bruises and frazzled nerves, city spokeswoman <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> said. About 150 people were evacuated from a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armory </ORGANIZATION> shelter after a natural gas leak. <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> issued a plea for additional doctors and nurses. Some homes that were damaged in the initial quake collapsed under the power of the aftershocks. Many residents of the town of 30,000, part of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s `` salad bowl'' region where much of the nation's lettuce, asparagus and artichokes are grown, spread across lawns and vacant lots like refugees. `` We're talking about people with no resources, no money for food and no money for health care,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Salud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gente </ORGANIZATION>, a state-financed community clinic. As of early Thursday, more than 1,400 aftershocks had been recorded. The strongest, 5.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, struck within 40 minutes of the initial jolt, according the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey. Across the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, the nation's fourth-largest metropolitan area with more than 6 million people, shaken cities tried to cope as best they could with still-limited services, strapped police and fire departments and transportation havoc created by the closing of freeways and the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, the lifeline that links <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. A transportation department spokesman said a large marine barge crane was being moved into place to lift the fallen upper deck slab of the bridge, which might be reopened in three weeks. Frustration and despair were evident on city streets. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> sat on a curb in the ravaged <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district with his head in his hands, crying.

 Behind him was the four-story collapsed apartment building in which two people died Tuesday night. They were <PERSON> Lai </PERSON>'s friends, and he had learned of their deaths only Thursday. `` I'm so upset. I came here, and it was all gone,'' <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> said. Throughout the district, sirens wailed, portable generators hummed and heavy equipment, brought in to finish the destruction the earthquake left unfinished, groaned. Marina residentsgathered at police barricades and begged for permission to retrieve food, clothing and medicine from their homes, but were denied because officials said the area was unsafe. `` This is a nightmare. I have to get my medicine for my asthma and for my stomach,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 54. Lawyer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Braden </PERSON> said he had been going to work in his black surfing T-shirt, gray sweat pants and brown dress shoes _ the only clothes he had. `` This is ridiculous. It's a free nation. We should be allowed to go back into our own homes,'' <PERSON> Braden </PERSON> said. The residents also scowled at a stream of tourists, armed with video cameras, who paraded past the barricades. Some schools and most bank branches reopened, and some shelters closed. The subway system was operating fully, but transit spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> reported below-normal passenger loads because many workers remained home. Before dawn Thursday, thousands of alarms set off across the Financial District heralded the restoration of power to downtown buildings. For the most part, community spirit held up, even as the reality of the devastation and hardship set in, and the grim tasks of uncovering bodies and cataloging damage continued. A non-profit organization that provides food to AIDS victims delivered more than 7,000 hot meals and sandwiches to shelters on both sides of the bay. Pizzeria owner <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Pallari </PERSON> mounted a charcoal grill in the bed of a pickup and served meals _ scrambled eggs, bacon and fresh coffee. `` I just could n't save it. It would have all been spoiled,'' he said. Volunteers continued toiling at the Nimitz Freeway disaster scene in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, preparing to stabilize the wreckage to eventually retrieve battered bodies. Rescue workers placed wood and iron pipe supports beneath tottering slabs of highway so they could work underneath the blood-spattered concrete. `` You try to ignore it and just do your job,'' said construction worker <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Elfring </PERSON>. Part of the slow digging process includes crawling into the wreckage to map the locations of the smashed cars, <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. Bright green, orange and pink paint marked the spots of cars and bodies. Once the map is complete and the span is supported, which could take several more days, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said, a machine called a concrete nibbler will break through the upper level to each car, removing sections of highway like pieces of cookie dough. At least one rescue worker, 20-year-old <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Solorio </PERSON>, said he believed there still may be survivors in the rubble. <PERSON> Solorio </PERSON> said he sneaked into a section of the sealed-off freeway. `` There are open spaces in there where a person could be trapped alive,'' he said. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> demanded an investigation into the collapse of I-880, saying it should have been built to survive the earthquake. Despite the freeway disaster, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> officials took note of the success of earthquake preparedness and building codes. Although the quake, at magnitude 6.9, was as strong as last year's Armenian earthquake, the destruction was not even remotely comparable. The Armenian quake killed 25,000 people. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would fly to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Friday `` to take a look and to provide encouragement to people.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said 1,173 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> National Guardsmen have been called to duty to help in quake recovery operations. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> began inspecting federal dams and levees and, at the request of the state government, state and private dams. So far, no damage has been reported for structures inspected within 50 miles of the epicenter. A U-2 reconnaisance plane from <ORGANIZATION> Beale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> flew over the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area to shoot pictures to detect problems in structures.

 Up to 4.5 million Poles will get the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first food stamps to battle inflation that has increased food prices by more than 1,000 percent in three months, a newspaper reported Thursday. The food coupons represent one of several steps the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's only non-communist government is taking to combat the worst effects of the current economic crisis as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> tries to switch to a market-oriented economy from a deficit-ridden centralized system Inflation is estimated at 600 percent or more annually. The effects have been particularly acute for food since the Aug. 1 lifting of controls that had used government subsidies to keep prices artificially low while creating an ever-widening budget deficit. Meat prices have increased sevenfold, with 2.2 pounds of pork costing $ 7.15. Butter has gone up from 14 cents for 1.1 pounds to $ 1.80 for the same amount. Food coupons were a part of the new government's economic reform plan announced Oct. 6, but details have not been presented. The food coupons will be available to pensioners and retirees, the disabled and others who are getting help from social welfare institutions, and children up to 6 years old from the poorest families, according to the pro-Solidarity newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION>. The recipients will be able to use coupons to pay for limited amounts of milk, cheese and bread. The coupons will also be redeemed at kindergartens, institution canteens and some other public facilities, the report said. The first of the coupons will be distributed in December by social agencies and local administrations to those who show evidence of their low income, the newspaper said. `` The distribution of the coupons will become a lesson of a kind of social trust. This ` second money' will be given on the basis of one's own statement about one's income,'' <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> said. About 4 million to 4.5 million people will meet the income limit that will be set Dec. 1, likely pegged to the lowest current pension, the report said. The food stamp program will be financed by withdrawing government subsidies from the production of lowfat milk, cheese and bread, the newspaper said. No figure was provided for the total cost. Across <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, soup kitchens have been opened by churches and charitable organizations to help those hardest hit by the effects of what Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> has called `` economic catastrophe.'' The government faces a budget deficit of $ 2.3 billion that could reach $ 4.4 billion by the end of the year without radical cost-cutting steps. A substantial portion of the deficit came from subsidies that were used to make up the widening gap between prices and the actual cost of production. Prices for many non-food items still are government-controlled, with controls to be lifted as part of the switch to a market economy. Unlike food stamps, subsidies supply cheap food to all, regardless of income, as did meat rationing, which assured modest, inexpensive supplies even to those who could afford to pay more on the free market. A rationing system continues in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to distribute scarce goods, but at the same fixed state prices. A special package of items is made available to pensioners, for example, but it is not free or reduced in price. Food prices were raised gradually over the years in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but the communist government tried other economic reforms in lieu of making major increases. It feared social unrest if the state replaced government subsidies for production. However, the last act of the government of <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, now communist party first secretary, was to lift government controls on food prices altogether Aug. 1 and end meat rationing. The new government agreed the step was needed but said it lacked precautions to protect the poor from the worst effects.

 Trees in autumnal technicolor of crimson and gold turned suddenly white Thursday when a storm blitzed the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> with up to 6 inches of snow, causing power outages to more than 200,000 customers in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. It was the earliest snowfall on record for many cities, including <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. Snow also fell in portions of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, where a firefighter was electrocuted by power lines downed by the snow. At least one other death, in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, was attributed to the storm. In many places, the snow followed unusually balmy weekend weather in the upper 70s and low 80s. `` I ca n't believe this,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fredbeck </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, where 6 inches of snow fell. `` We've got Halloween decorations up inside and they look so stupid now.'' Some 100,000 Cincinnati-area customers had power knocked out as the wet, heavy snow piled up on leaf-laden trees, causing them to break and fall on power lines. <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoecklin </PERSON> said he expected service to be restored by Thursday night. About 20,000 <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> customers in the Akron-area were affected by outages but most had service restored by evening. Electricity was knocked out to more than 20,000 customers in the <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> area, but was restored to all but about 16,000 by evening, said <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Toledo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> said 19,000 customers lost electricity, but only 3,500 remained without power by Thursday night. Schools were closed in much of the state as 3 to 5 inches of snow fell in southwestern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and 1 to 3 inches of snow was reported elsewhere in the state. A Covington, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, man was killed when his car veered into the opposite lane of a snow-slickened state highway and struck a pickup truck near <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>. The area had received 4 inches of snow. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecaster, said records dating back to about 1870 show no snowfall in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> as early as Oct. 19. It was also an earliest snowfall record for <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>. The snow that fell in most of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and parts of southern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, eastern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> was caused by a Canadian cold front that met up with a storm system over the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, up to 4 inches of snow fell, knocking out power to up to 100,000 customers stretched from <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> to the state's northcentral and northeastern sections An assistant fire chief in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>, 42, was electrocuted by felled power lines weighed down by snow at a house where a fire was reported, said <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, deputy coroner in <LOCATION> Boone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, the 2.7 inches of snow that had fallen by early evening did n't set a record for early snowfall, but it did set one for the heaviest for the month of October. The previous record had been 1.4 inches on Oct. 19, 1930, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Deedler </PERSON>, a meteorologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bufalini </PERSON> said 41,500 customers were without power. A <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman blamed high winds and snow for knocking out power to 16,000 customers in <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in southern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> power customers suffered outages as well. Public Service <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the state's largest utility, reported electricity was knocked out to 6,000 customers, but service was restored to most of the homes and businesses later Thursday, said <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Plainfield-based company that serves the state's southern and central portions. About 3,000 customers of <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, serving the northeastern part of the state, and <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> lost power, but service was restored to most, spokesmen said. A snow advisory was in effect for all of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> until Friday. Up to 6 inches of snow had already accumulated over north-central, central and east-central <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, making it in one day the snowiest October on record. <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>' snowfall of up to 6 inches was the deepest on record since the weather service began keeping records in 1885, said meteorologist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. It also broke a record for the earliest measurable snow, set Oct. 20, 1916. Light snowfall was reported in the afternoon in the central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, with sleet in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. Winds were gusting to 40 mph and temperatures were in the low to mid 30s. Up to 4 inches' accumulation was forecast for parts of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Snow flurries in the eastern half of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> on Friday gave <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> its earliest snowfall on record. Like <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, it broke a record set Oct. 20, 1916.

<TEXT>
 National Drug Policy Coordinator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said on Thursday that the drug crisis in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> continues to worsen despite a six-month joint partnership by federal and local authorities fighting the problem. `` No one should be surprised to learn that the nation's capital is still plagued by a serious drug problem,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` We picked a difficult task last April, and I never had any illusions about the challenges that lay before us.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> made his remarks while issuing a six-month `` progress report'' on a special initiative he generated to help the district curb its record murder rate and drug-related crime wave. So far in 1989, 360 persons have been killed in the district, 12 short of the all-time annual record that was set last year. By this time in 1988, 270 homicides had been reported in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Police blame drugs, particularly crack cocaine, for more than 60 percent of these deaths. On Wednesday, city officials complained that <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s contributions have done little to stop the killings and said he has taken credit for a variety of other anti-drug programs and initiatives already in effect `` Where we need help, they have not responded,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasmine </PERSON>, an assistant to City Administrator <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. `` There's a long road to go.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> defended the federal government's efforts, but said he knew that local and federal authorities are in for a long battle. `` I would n't say that -LRB- we -RRB- have n't made any difference, but I would still say the situation is intolerable,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` We are in the process of getting control of the situation ... but it will take time.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who criticized the city government for its handling of the drug crisis shortly after he took office, said on Thursday that his office is working better with district officials now.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> threatened to cut economic ties with <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> if the government or king attends the ceremony awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, Norwegian TV said, but <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> showed no sign of give Thursday. <PERSON> Egil </PERSON> <PERSON> Aarvik </PERSON>, head of the awarding committee, dismissed the threat while assessing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s reaction as the strongest by any government since <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s fury when an anti-Nazi won the award 53 years ago. `` <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> reacted with a similar rage when <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Ossietzky </PERSON> won the prize for 1935,'' <PERSON> Aarvik </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. <PERSON> Ossietzky </PERSON>, a German journalist, peace activist and opponent of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, was in a Nazi concentration camp when the award was made in 1936. <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> responded by saying no German would be allowed to accept the prize. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, exiled <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> leader of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, was named the peace laureate Oct. 5 for his non-violent struggle to end Chinese rule of his homeland. The announcement was widely seen as an implied rebuke to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for its crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in June. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sigrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Romundset </PERSON> said the Chinese have not officially threatened a boycott. The ceremony will be held on Dec. 10. <PERSON> Guisheng </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, of the Chinese embassy in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, refused to comment on the threat reported on Wednesday by Norwegian television. `` It is well known that we protested earlier,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> complained on Oct. 7 that the award supported the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s efforts to split <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and hurt the feelings of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Kjell </PERSON> <PERSON> Magne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bondevik </PERSON> observed, `` There are established practices about participating in the awards ceremony and we have no plans of changing them.''

 Engineers delayed strengthening the 32-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> freeway that collapsed in this week's earthquake because they believed it would survive a major quake, the state transportation chief said Thursday `` We did n't know 10 years ago this was subject to this type of earthquake damage. We did not know there was any possibility it would collapse,'' <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Best </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Best </PERSON> said he was unaware of a private engineer's report in 1975 that the collapsed Interstate 880 viaduct had an outdated design that made it vulnerable to such quakes. `` I've been assured there were no experts, no studies, no data that suggested in any way that it would fall,'' <PERSON> Best </PERSON> said. State inspection reports for the collapsed section show a history of minor problems over the years, including hair-line cracks, flaking concrete, a cracked girder and sagging deck. Some problems were corrected and others were n't. `` -LRB- But -RRB- there was no problem of structural failure at all,'' <PERSON> Best </PERSON> said of the reports. A 1 \ - mile-long stretch of the two-tiered Nimitz Freeway collapsed during Tuesday An upper section of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> also collapsed. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> has called for an immediate investigation of I-880's collapse. The governor said the freeway should have been built to survive the quake, which registered 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion. A blue-ribbon commission of bridge engineers is being set up to determine why the structure collapsed and what steps can be taken to prevent such tragedies in the future, <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a Pleasant Hill engineer, said he determined in 1975 that the structure would n't survive a major earthquake. And he said the information was presented to state transportation officials at that time. <PERSON> Best </PERSON> said it's `` irresponsible'' to suggest the state knew the structure would collapse. He said it's possible there were `` unusual subsurface conditions that we did n't know about'' which could have contributed to the collapse. The highway was built on fill soils. The failed structure had undergone only the first phase of a three-step program to reinforce the roadway, <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> said. Engineers felt I-880 would be at less risk than other highways because `` it was the least likely to fail.'' The retrofitting project on I-880 began in 1977 and was the first road improvement since the highway was designed in 1954 and constructed in 1957. But phase two of the program for I-880 and other roadways with double-column supports was deferred as officials focused on strengthening roads with single-column supports, which they believed were more vulnerable, <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> said. The first phase involved strengthening the roadway; the second began on single-column supports two years ago and involves strengthening existing columns. Authorities deferred the I-880 retrofitting pending outcome of a still-unfinished engineering study to determine the best sort of repairs. The freeway was last inspected in April. Officials had no estimate of when that study might be completed. They emphasized that I-880 was not neglected or given too low a priority in the retrofitting project. Asked whether the I-880 section had been considered safe from earthquake damage, <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> chief engineer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said, `` There's no such thing as an earthquake-proof structure, certainly.'' But he added he was `` shocked'' by the section's collapse. `` We thought it would withstand the maximum credible earthquake we could have in this area, anything that would happen in this area,'' he said.

 Some <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> affiliates complained that NBC News did n't quickly air coverage of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake, but were understanding when the delay was explained, an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> official said Thursday.

 Televison networks all sent dozens of staffers to cover the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake, but sheer numbers could n't always overcome the enormous difficulties the story presented. Even with million-dollar anchors and squadrons of correspondents, technicians and producers, the three broadcast networks and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> quickly learned it's a grind to deliver compelling, competitive reports in conditions where rumor and misinformation have flowed like water. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> arrived at destroyed Interstate 880 on Wednesday morning and, minutes later, delivered a live dispatch that demonstrated the hazards of capturing the story both quickly and accurately. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said rescue workers had labored through the night to save lives on the collapsed freeway. Anyone who had spent the early-morning hours there would have said very little happened after midnight. In one of his initial news bulletins Tuesday night from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> played it safe. Not wanting to speculate on information he did n't have, Rather read major earthquake figures from an almanac. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carman </PERSON>, the television critic for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>, said quake coverage by <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> was sometimes as inexact as it was instant -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> was on the air six minutes after the quake hit -RRB-. <PERSON> Carman </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> anchors <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> were unfamiliar with such things as local geography and area codes. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> has heard some complaints, too. `` We've been criticized from both ends _ for being too cautious and then I had a call that we're doing too much coverage,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Dees </PERSON>. After overcoming various initial jitters, all four networks were praised by TV critics for steady, informative broadcasts. Ratings were strong, too. The three broadcast network newscasts originated Wednesday night from the earthquake zone, as <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> was joined in town by Rather and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> sent <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> anchor <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON> and 25 correspondents. The networks also broadcast prime-time specials on the disaster. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show was anchored in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` 48 Hours'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` PrimeTime Live'' planned broadcasts on the quake for Thursday night. NBC News President <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON> said his network had 60 staffers in the city. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyward </PERSON>, the executive producer of `` 48 Hours,'' said Thursday the arrival of the network stars testified to the story's importance `` There is an advantage for the anchor to be in the city _ it's certainly better than in the studio,'' <PERSON> Heyward </PERSON> said. Indeed, national interest in the TV accounts and mesmerizing footage has been profound. Preliminary ratings for the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> specials Wednesday night indicated nearly half of all homes with television tuned in. According to <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> estimates, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s special, `` The Great Quake of'89,'' was the highest-rated of the broadcasts, averaging a 13.2 rating. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s special, `` Earthquake Aftershock,'' directly competing with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s program at 10 p.m. EDT, was second with a 12.2 rating. A `` CBS Reports'' special, `` The <LOCATION> Califoria </LOCATION> Earthquake,'' which aired an hour earlier, averaged an 11.9 rating. Each rating point represents 921,000 homes. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> set an all-time viewership record Tuesday night, when more than 3.6 million homes watched the news network, <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Masterson </PERSON> said. `` The great difficulties are imposed by the loss of power, traffic jams and obstacles created by the story itself,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> Executive Vice President <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. `` Once you have that established, the unfolding of the story is not that difficult.'' Journalistic standards can crumble when dealing with a disaster such as the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` The greatest trap is to pass on bad information _ and there's a lot of it out there _ or create an alarmist atmosphere and scare people. You have to be judicious in your demeanor.'' While many are transfixed by the television images, not all are pleased. Viewers of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliate <ORGANIZATION> KMOV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> flooded the switchboard when Tuesday earthquake coverage first interrupted a TV movie on acquaintance rape.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> on Thursday estimated at least $ 2.5 billion in federal funds would be needed for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake damage and said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would vote next week to provide it, deficit or no deficit. The money will be included in the continuing resolution to be voted on Tuesday. This is a stopgap money bill needed to keep the government operating until all the appropriations bills are approved. `` If the deficit has to go up, the deficit will have to rise,'' said <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, comparing the earthquake to a family emergency. `` If a family has a tragedy, it may not be in the budget,'' but needs have to be met, he said. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said that the federal government is obligated by law to assist in emergencies such as the earthquake and Hurricane Hugo. He said the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will not make the people of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> suffer because of a tight federal budget. Meanwhile, Former House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> `` Tip'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> defended President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s response to the earthquake, even though the president did not visit the scene immediately. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s comments came after talking to members of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> delegation who went home to survey the damage. During a telephone conference call, Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, a Democrat from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> the scene was `` a heart-breaker'' that would require funds `` in the billions.'' Democrat <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, who had just returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said `` it's hard to imagine from pictures how bad it is.'' Another Democrat, <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> to estimate by 9 a.m. Monday how much money will be needed. He said he already sees a need for at least $ 800 million more for highways and bridges than has been budgeted. He said legislation would have to be passed to remove certain restrictions on the amount a single state can get in federal funds for highway work. He also said the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> `` is almost out of money'' and needs at least another $ 1 billion for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., said earlier in the day that he expected the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to act next week as well Speaking at a news conference in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said: `` I do n't think it's right to criticize the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for local disasters because he does n't appear on the scene. They do get the apparatus in motion.'' `` I think he's responded very quickly to the problems out there,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said.

 Two Sichuan farmers were sentenced to death and two others were given life imprisonment for selling panda skins, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. An intermediate court in the southwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> province gave <PERSON> Liang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongzheng </PERSON> the death sentence for selling seven panda skins for 300,000 yuan, or $ 81,000. The other condemned man, He Guanghai, made 30,000 yuan, or $ 8,100, by selling skins, the agency said. It said two of <PERSON> Liang </PERSON>'s seven accomplices received life in prison. The men were from <LOCATION> Pingwu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, a major habitat of the giant panda. The animal is native to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and only about 1,000 still survive in the wilds of <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. The Chinese government has forbidden hunting of the endangered species, and courts in <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> have repeatedly called for harsh punishments of people caught killing or selling the animals. Several offenders have been given life in prison, although the death sentence is rare for panda poaching.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency that coordinates aid for Palestinian refugees said Thursday the Israeli army raided its main food distribution center and three other offices in the occupied lands and roughed up two staff workers. The U.N.

In Wednesday's raids, the soldiers detained <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> workers and confiscated documents at the food distribution center in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Balah </PERSON> camp and at service offices in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> refugee camps of Dheishe, <ORGANIZATION> Fawwar </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Jalazoun </LOCATION> The <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> statement said they `` roughed up and detained'' two international staff members, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Declan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenway </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and detained four <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers. All now are free. `` <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> has discussed with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities the serious breaches of privileges and immunities which the agency enjoys as an international body providing humanitarian services,'' it said. Asked about the case, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, `` We have called on all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid the kinds of confrontations described in these reports. `` As a general matter, we regret any actions that interfere with the <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION>'s important humanitarian operations in providing education, medical and relief services to Palestinian refugees.'' An officer with the military government in the occupied lands said the troops were investigating reports `` some employees of <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> are either participating in the uprising themselves or aiding activities of the uprising.'' The officer, who insisted on anonymity, said he had not seen the <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> complaint and had no comment. <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said, `` We have no knowledge of any illegal activities inside our installations.

The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, in its weekly report, noted that more than 40,000 excess flu-related deaths have occurred in each of several influenza epidemics in recent years. An estimated 300,000 new hepatitis B cases occur each year, and the incidence of measles and mumps is on the rise in young adults. `` Safe and effective vaccines are available for all these diseases,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s report called attention to next week's designation as the fourth annual National Adult Immunization Awareness Week.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday he wanted `` to take a look and to provide encouragement'' during a tour of earthquake-shattered <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> pledged up to $ 2.5 billion in disaster funds from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said that he did not know where all the money would be found, but promised that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would provide it in a vote next week. `` If the deficit has to go up, the deficit will have to rise,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said, comparing the quake to a family emergency. `` If a family has a tragedy, it may not be in the budget'' but the needs still have to be met. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to leave <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before dawn Friday, flying across country for a five-hour inspection tour of damage sites by helicopter and car. He planned to make stops in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, two of the most devastated areas. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced his trip amid Democratic complaints and Republican praise over the government's response to Tuesday's quake, which authorities estimate caused $ 2 billion in damage Initial estimates of more than 250 deaths were proving much too high, officials said Thursday night without offering new estimates, and coroners in seven counties reported only 31 bodies recovered. The president said he was confident that federal officials were doing a good job and promised `` we will stay on top of it.'' After an early-morning flight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to spend three hours in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Friday, much of the time in a helicopter tour. `` We'll do as much as we can without disrupting local activities,'' White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is to fly to <LOCATION> Moffett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> View </LOCATION> and take a helicopter to <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> on the east side of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, and then drive to <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> to view the collapsed Interstate 880. He then is to double back to <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> for a helicopter hop to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, where there is extensive damage. Tuesday's quake was the deadliest since the 1906 temblor that killed 2,500 people in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on a similar inspection mission after Hurricane Hugo last month, but the federal government was accused by some officials there of moving too slowly in providing disaster relief. In this instance, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, a Republican, had called `` to express appreciation for the all-out federal effort.'' However, the Democratic mayor of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, said he was `` ticked off'' that Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had not met with him during a tour of quake damage. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` flies around in a helicopter, makes a bunch of television spots. ... I have real questions about what he was ding here. It may have been just a publicity stunt.'' <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> was invited to accompany <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday, along with the mayors of <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said all mayors in the quake area had been invited to a meeting with him. `` I think it's very unfortunate to take that kind of a shot at a very difficult time.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> had turned away several administration approaches. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> has begun inspecting federal dams and levees, and, at the request of the state government, state and private dams. So far, he said, no damage had been discovered in structures checked within 50 miles of the quake's epicenter. A U-2 reconnaissance plane from <ORGANIZATION> Beale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> flew over the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area late Wednesday, and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said its photos might help in the detection of structural problems. Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> would be eligible for federal job-training funds to assist any workers who lost their jobs because of the quake. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> to the Oval Office to report on the helicopter tour they took Wednesday to damage sites. `` Our hearts certainly go out to the victims of this disaster,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And I will go out there tomorrow to take a look and to provide encouragement to the people.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, in an appearance on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' program, said, `` All federal resources have been marshaled.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> `` Today'' show if there was enough money available for the relief effort. He replied, `` We will put the maximum that we can behind that, working with state and local levels of government to clean the situation up.'' The White House said an initial $ 273 million will be available for the area from a pool of $ 1.1 billion that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appropriated after the devastation caused by Hurricane Hugo. As for the flap with <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the mayor was invited to two meetings up wherever he was and deliver him to the meetings, and he declined that.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, had tried to call Agnos for several days, and `` he declined to talk to us. We regret very much that the mayor of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> has declined to cooperate with us in this matte in making sure there is adequate federal support for the disaster in his city.''

 Computers are giving some worried friends and relatives around the world their first word about earthquake-damaged sections of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` This is sort of like what ham radio operators do, only it's on a computer,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, editorial services manager of <ORGANIZATION> CompuServe </ORGANIZATION>. `` It has been instrumental in giving concerned people the straight scoop. It's getting a lot of the information coming out of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> straight in an accurate and timely manner _ often more quickly than the news media can.'' The Columbus-based computer information service, with 550,000 individual and 1,800 corporate customers worldwide, created an `` earthquake forum'' where people could leave messages and information about 5 p.m. Wednesday. By 11 a.m. Thursday, more than 430 messages _ many seeking information _ had been filed. Prodigy, a <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based venture of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, had a system going less than four hours after Tuesday's quake, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ek </PERSON>, communications manager. By Thursday afternoon, 1,530 messages were posted. It also put a psychologist on line Wednesday night `` to help these people deal with the trauma. We had one person who know some of the people involved in the Nimitz highway situation who was pretty distraught,'' <PERSON> Ek </PERSON> said. Prodigy has subscribers in more than 100,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> households. Many messages sought information about conditions; others were personal. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> man trying to find a <LOCATION> Burlingame </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, couple, learned in about an hour that they not only had survived but had become grandparents after the quake _ but that one of their fathers had died the day before Tuesday's earthquake. `` Everyone was in good spirits, given the circumstances,'' a message said. Computer samaritans also acted as messengers for those who could n't reach loved ones by phone. An <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> woman reported `` for anybody worrying about their daughter'' at <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, students were shaken but fine. `` Talked to my good friend's daughter there who is a freshman from <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and her first time away from home. I told her ` Welcome to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,' as she had never ever experienced an earthquake, let alone a biggie like the SF quake.'' A man from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> sought help finding friends vacationing in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, but their whereabouts were not known. Word also came from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlos </LOCATION> that damage there `` was primarily on the nerves,'' and from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> that a woman sustained no damage to her house, though her birdbath was tipped over. The system is available only to <ORGANIZATION> CompuServe </ORGANIZATION> members, who pay $ 12.50 an hour to dial into the electronic bulletin board through their personal computers. It is the first time <ORGANIZATION> CompuServe </ORGANIZATION> has set up a forum solely for earthquake-related information, though it has been pressed into service for other disasters. Members exchanged information Jan. 28, 1986, when Challenger exploded, and when the stock market crashed Oct. 19, 1987. <ORGANIZATION> CompuServe </ORGANIZATION> also posted messages in the system last month when Hurricane Hugo swept into the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>. The year-old Prodigy charges subscribers a flat $ 9.95 a month.

 `` I got lucky, but no pushups for a while.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, a 41-year-old executive, wryly offered that assessment Thursday from a hospital bed where he was mending after breaking his breastbone when his car dropped with the collapsing Interstate 880 freeway. `` I thought I was going to die, and that was that,'' said <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, who believes his sternum was broken when his chest slammed against his seat belt _ but the splintered bone missed piercing his heart and aorta. Alone in his car, <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> had just left the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> shortly after 5 p.m. Tuesday, headen buildings and plan for temblors on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fault </ORGANIZATION>, which has spawned some of the strongest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> quakes, experts say. The quake that rattled the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area on Tuesday `` has about a 1-in-3 probability of happening on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fault </ORGANIZATION> in the next 10 years,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of the Center for Earthquake Studies in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Girardeau </LOCATION>. `` We can watch what's happening out there and take a lot of notes `` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> is the best prepared city for an earthquake in the world. What <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> has been doing for a long time is going to pay off.'' The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> quake, measuring 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, has been blamed for 2,000 injuries as well as nearly $ 3 billion in damage to property, bridges, highways and rail lines. Early estimates were that 270 people died, but on Thursday officials said the death toll could be much lower. The earthquake that devastated Soviet <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> last December also had a 6.9 Richter reading, but killed 25,000 people and did $ 16 billion in damage. `` <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> was an example of absolutely no preparation,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. `` We're not as bad off as <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, but we're certainly not anywhere near as well prepared as <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> was.'' Quakes are much less frequent on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fault </ORGANIZATION>, which runs from Marked Tree, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, into southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, but scientists say there is a 40 percent to 63 percent chance of a 6.3 quake by the year 2000. `` The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> Fault is probably the most dangerous fault in the eastern half of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but there is far more danger of an earthquake on the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fault </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiens </PERSON>, assistant professor of earth and planetary sciences at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` But that's not to say that there's not danger. Just less.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fault </ORGANIZATION> has minor earthquakes registering 3 to 4 `` almost daily,'' but the last one above 6.0 was in 1985, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, chairman of the department of earth and atmospheric sciences at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. In the summer of 1987, a quake of 4.9 hit along the southern Illinois-Indiana border, causing minor damage. A series of temblors that ripped through the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> zone in 1811 and 1812 could be felt in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> but occurred in a largely unpopulated area and the number of deaths is unknown. There was no equipment to measure earthquakes in the 1800s, but scientists say the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> quakes would probably have been up to 8.7. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake of 1906 is estimated at 8.3. The 1985 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> quake that killed 10,000 measured 8.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude.

<HEAD>Scientists Determine Quake's Mercalli Intensity in Weeks After Shaking</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While scientists quickly estimate the magnitude of a quake on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, it takes weeks to map out its intensity on the modified Mercalli scale. <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s disastrous earthquake on Tuesday had a magnitude of 6.9, according to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey. A quake can have only a single magnitude, although scientists using different types of seismometers often come up with different estimates. But a quake can have many intensities. That's because intensity is a measurement of a quake's actual shaking effects at various locations. Thus, intensities tend to be highest closest to the epicenter. But they also can be high at greater distances where ground is soft. Italian seismologist <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercalli </PERSON> developed his 12-point intensity scale in 1902, and it was modified in 1931 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> seismologists <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON>. Wood and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON>. Roman numerals are used. The areas most hard hit in Tuesday's quake _ locations sitting on soft <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> mud or fill dirt _ may have experienced shaking as high as IX or perhaps X on the modified Mercalli scale, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> seismologist <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> said Thursday. But she emphasized she was guessing, based on damage she saw on television. In intensity X areas, cracks several inches wide appear in soft ground, well-built wood buildings and bridges are severely damaged and some collapse, most masonry structures are destroyed, buried pipes tear apart or are crushed, cracks and fold open in pavement. In intensity IX areas, conspicuous cracks develop in the ground, damage is great in most masonry buildings and considerable in those built to withstand quakes, underground pipes sometimes break and some quake-resistant wood homes shift off foundations. Federal scientists usually conduct field interviews and survey damage to construct a map showing the intensities produced by a major quake, <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> said. Other intensity scales are used in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> wound up the third round of talks on limiting conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Thursday by presenting proposals on curbing maneuvers and exchanging and verifying military information across the continent. In their initial reaction, Western diplomats welcomed the proposals and noted several concepts and language identical to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposals on the same subject Sept. 21. Negotiators from both blocs at the 23-nation talks hailed the progress made during the six-week round, but expressed disappointment that agreement on details is still rare. `` Generally, we're making a lot of progress,'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> told reporters. `` But specifically, we have not got much concrete to show for it yet.'' `` More could have been done,'' said Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinevsky </PERSON>. The only language agreed by both sides for an initial treaty both blocs want to sign next year is the definition of artillery. <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Grinevsky </PERSON> and West German Ambassador <PERSON> Ruediger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartmann </PERSON> expressed hope the fourth round, beginning Nov. 9 and lasting until Dec. 21, will see more discussion of specifics. The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact proposals presented Thursday contained different specifics on limiting military maneuvers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> than earlier <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> suggestions. They omitted, for example, mention of limitation on equipment used in such exercises. But the East accepted significant details of the West's proposal It agreed that no more than 40,000 men be engaged in military maneuvers by one bloc, but sought to limit such large exercises to once every three years, as against once every two years as proposed by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. The East also agreed that annual exchange of verification data take place on Dec. 15 once any treaty is in force, and that 42 days be the period of prior notification for changing force structures. Both sides agreed major differences still exist over the definition of weapons categories such as tanks, the verification of armaments levels in different regions of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the inclusion or exclusion of Soviet air defense interceptors, training aircraft and certain types of helicopter in the complex aircraft category. `` The most urgent problem is definition'' of weapons categories, said <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON>. `` The most complex is verification, and I think the toughest one is still the aircraft issue.'' The talks opened in March. They replaced negotiations on troop reductions in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that dragged on for 15 years without agreement.

 A healthy <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft sped unerringly toward distant Jupiter on Thursday, while the five orbiting astronauts who released it measured the threatened ozone layer that is Earth's natural sunscreen. Racing along at more than 9,000 mph, the probe Thursday night was more than 260,000 miles out on its 2.4-billion-mile, six-year journey to study the largest planet in the solar system in a search for clues to how the universe began. <PERSON> Galileo </PERSON> was dispatched from Atlantis' cargo bay Wednesday night, 6 -LCB- hours after the shuttle was launched from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials reported Thursday the craft was in `` perfect shape'' and `` right on course.'' Atlantis also was pronounced in `` excellent condition'' by <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> after the crew members successfully restored a cooling system that shut down Wednesday when it overheated and cut in a backup unit. On Thursday, a major solar flare hurled a surge of radiation toward Earth, but <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials said they were not concerned. Government scientists said the flare may disrupt communications and electrical power transmission over the next two days, but <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said it had been evaluated and was not considered a problem for the astronauts. `` In the orbit we're in, at 160-mile altitude, it is no threat at all,'' said flight director <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dittemore </PERSON>. The burst also has had no impact on <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>, which is `` built for much harsher environments than a solar flare,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleggett-Haleim </PERSON>. Earlier Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> wakened the space travelers with a musical tribute to Atlantis commander <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and pilot <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCulley </PERSON>, both naval aviators and graduates of <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Played were `` Hail Purdue'' and `` Anchors Aweigh,'' with reveille sandwiched in between. The other crew members are <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucid </PERSON>. They began a series of medical, materials processing and other experiments that will occupy their time until they return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on Monday. Landing is scheduled for <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, at 2:38 p.m. EDT Monday. On <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> satellite television Thursday night, <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> demonstrated a retinal photography test on the shuttle's middeck With swimming goggles strapped around her head, Mrs. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> steadied herself while <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON> pressed a camera to the right goggle to photograph her retina. Researchers said the camera slides should help them determine if there are any changes in the eye's vessels in zero gravity. Such changes could indicate some brain swelling, and researchers want to determine if that is related to motion sickness in space. A new shuttle experiment used a sensitive instrument in the cargo bay to measure sections of the Earth's ozone layer, an area of the upper atmosphere that protects our planet from most of the sun's ultraviolet radiation. There is global concern over depletion of the ozone layer, and many people fear its destruction will cause a rise in such human health problems as skin cancer. The information gathered by the Atlantis crew will be compared with data being collected at the same time and over the same areas by nearly identical sensors aboard three older <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellites. Researchers want the new data so they can accurately calibrate the satellite sensors. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> considers the experiment so important that it has scheduled it for six more shuttle flights. `` Accurate, reliable measurements from space are critical to the detection of ozone trends and for assessing the potential effects and development of corrective measures,'' the agency said. Scientists report the ozone shield has thinned out worldwide by about 3 percent within the last two decades, with the largest losses occurring over the polar regions. The depletion is thought to be increased by the interaction of certain manmade chemicals, principally chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, used as refrigerants and in the manufacturing of some plastic products. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers and users of CFCs have announced plans to stop making the chemical or to guard against releasing it into the atmosphere. <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>, which slowed from its initial earth-escape velocity of more than 25,000 mph, has a long way to go on its odyssey that will take it on a scenic route through the solar system. Its path will whip it once past <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, twice around the Earth and within view of an asteroid before it reaches Jupiter in December 1995. The roundabout route is necessary for the 6,000-pound spacecraft to use the gravity forces of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> to gain enough speed to reach its target. Once at Jupiter, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> will fire a probe into the Jovian atmosphere and then orbit the planet for a planned 22-month study. Scientists believe the probe could reveal much about the birth of the universe. Because Jupiter has apparently undergone little change from its beginnings, its composition is thought to resemble the cloud of gas and dust from which the sun and planets formed. <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>'s observations could give scientists a better idea of what the early solar system looked like when it formed 4.6 billion years ago Similarly, the Jovian atmosphere's hydrogen-to-helium ratio promises to be a vital clue to the validity of the big-bang theory, which holds that the universe was created in a single explosive moment more than 15 billion years ago. The ratio is thought to be about the same as was created at the time of the big bang.

<TEXT>
 Pounded by a sudden hail of ethics accusations, mayoral candidate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> struggled to regain his footing Thursday in his heretofore stately stroll toward the election. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, the Democratic nominee, lashed at Republican <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, accusing him of `` gutter politics,'' bullying and slander and threatening to respond with negative attacks of his own. The uncharacteristic vitriol underlined <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' dismay over a week of unrelenting criticism by <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> _ who has been trailing badly in polls in the strongly Democratic city _ much of it prompted by news reports on <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' handling of a stock sale and a conflict of interest issue. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' troubles were compounded Thursday, first by Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s call for him to release a city investigation of his failure to file tax returns during 1969-72, then by charges he ducked taxes more recently by understating the value of stock he sold to his son, and finally by a racist remark by a black activist who had worked for his campaign. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, who would be the city's first black mayor, has called his 1969-72 failure to file tax returns an oversight that he corrected in 1973. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, a former federal prosecutor, accused <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> of intentionally breaking the city ethics law _ punishable, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> noted, by up to a year in jail. At issue, chiefly, was <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' investment in Inner City Broadcasting, a privately held, highly successful media company formed in 1972 by his political mentor, former <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Borough President <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>. In 1986 <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, himself newly elected as <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> borough president, sold his 558 shares of Inner City to his son, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, for $ 58,000, payable with 8 percent annual interest in 1991. He did not reveal the transaction on financial disclosure forms; aides say it was an `` installment sales contract'' and thus did not have to be listed as a gift or receivable note. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> had far underestimated the stock's value, which has no public market price because it is not publicly traded. Newsday quoted Inner City's general counsel as saying the stock in 1986 was worth, conservatively, $ 4,292 per share, or more than $ 2 million for <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' shares. Newsday quoted a tax expert as saying a $ 58,000 sale price for stock worth much more represented `` a huge gift.'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishlow </PERSON> maintained that the $ 58,000 valuation was proper: `` He made appropriate inquiries and valued it fairly.'' <PERSON> Fishlow </PERSON> said he did not know with whom <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> spoke or by what formula he valued the stock. The official quoted in Newsday said he estimated Inner City's worth by a common formula _ 10 times the company's annual revenues. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> also attacked <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' involvement as a city official in business between <LOCATION> Inner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the city government, even though the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> had warned against it. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> had requested the ethics ruling and cited it when he abstained from a 1987 vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION>, which handles contracts and zoning, on a matter involving Inner City. But he conceded Wednesday that aides sitting in for him on the board voted in 1987 for a zoning change for Inner City's new office and this year for a transfer of its cable franchise. In another development, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> `` Sonny'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, a black activist who helped organize a voter drive for <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, scoffed Thursday at charges that he was an anti-Semite. `` I'm anti-white. I do n't limit my antis to just being one little group of people, and I think you would insult me if you tried to do that,'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said when asked about the accusation made last week by B'nai B'rith's <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Defamation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> insisted he had not been hired by <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' campaign and personally received no money. The campaign has said it paid <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> $ 9,800 to organize the drive for the Sept. 12 Democratic primary. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s comments prompted a terse statement from <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>: `` <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s comments represent the kind of bigotry and intolerance I utterly reject and have fought against my whole life. Had such comments come to my attention, he would never have played any role in my campaign.''

 At first, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> thought all four tires on his car had gone flat, but when the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> started bouncing and weaving, he realized it was an earthquake. Then the bridge gave way and he was plunging toward the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. `` The ground just opened up and the car started going down,'' <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> said Thursday. `` All I could think is, ` I'm going through the bridge and into the Bay.' ... I knew it was death. I did n't think there was anything that could stop us. When it was over, <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON>'s gray <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> stopped only inches shy of plunging into the bay. He was looking at water, his car wedged in the gap between the collapsed upper deck and split-open lower deck. In a fluke <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> and his passenger, <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Freiburger </PERSON>, can not explain, they were in the only vehicle on the falling section of bridge. <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, was treated for minor bruises and released. Freiburger, 41, of <LOCATION> Larkspur </LOCATION>, was hospitalized with a cracked sternum, a cracked collar bone and a crack in her spine. Doctors predict that she will be released early next week. `` When I look at it, I ca n't imagine that neither of us were -LRB- more seriously -RRB- hurt,'' <PERSON> Freiburger </PERSON> said from her room at <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Presbyterian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. `` I have injuries, but I'm just fine.'' <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Freiburger </PERSON>, co-workers at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> real estate company, were returning from a project in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> when they were caught on the bridge. `` It all happened in just split seconds,'' Freiburger recalled. `` First there was a moment of utter silence and then boom, an explosion-type of noise. It all opened up. We went traveling down like a roller coaster ride, just that fast.'' `` I closed my eyes real tight and made my mind blank,'' said <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON>. `` You know how you're supposed to have all those flashbacks and your whole life flashes before your eyes? That did n't happen. ... I told <PERSON> Janice </PERSON>, ` We're going to die,' and she said, ` No, we're not. Hold on.''' After the car stopped, <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> clambered out the window and onto the hood of the car before hoisting himself up onto the surface of the bridge's lower deck. He said he did n't look down as he and a stranger helped pull Freiburger from the hood to the roadway. The pair walked more than a mile to <LOCATION> Treasure </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where they were examined at a clinic before being taken by ambulance to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> said he is trying to come to grips with his good fortune. `` It seems like it should be more profound. It was kind of a brush with death, but I do n't feel that much different,'' he said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> sophomore died in what school officials said appears to have been a hazing incident in the nation's oldest black fraternity, and school officials said they may expel the members involved. School officials said the college had suspended the <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> chapter's charter. Medical examiners have not determined the cause of death of <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but they said he appeared to suffer from a heart condition. However, his mother, <PERSON> Adrienne </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, said Thursday her son had been healthy, despite undergoing open-heart surgery when he was 2 years old to correct a birth defect. She said he was born with holes between the chambers of his heart, which were closed surgically. `` <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> was very active all his life,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> state director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said the death occurred Wednesday at a gathering in an apartment for 19 young men interested in joining the 110,000-member fraternity. He said the students told him they met with approximately seven fraternity brothers and `` were pushed and shoved around'' when they failed to correctly answer questions about the fraternity. `` Next thing they knew, they looked around and the fellow was lying on the floor,'' <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said. `` At first they thought he was faking it, but then when they realized he was n't faking, they called 911.'' <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said that according to the potential pledges, the fraternity brothers knew of <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' history of heart trouble. `` <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> was n't really picked on,'' <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said. `` They -LRB- pledges -RRB- said they did n't see <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> get hit.'' The fraternity's president, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrell </PERSON>, could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday. The fraternity chapter does not have a house, there was no telephone listing for <PERSON> Burrell </PERSON>, and a message left for him at the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> dean of students office was not immediately returned. The fraternity _ the country's oldest black Greek-letter organization _ prohibits hazing, which also is outlawed in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said in a statement that the chapter also had not received clearance from school officials to `` commence their pledge period'' or engage in any form of off-campus pledge activities. School officials said the college also was conducting an internal investigation and would `` take appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal of all participants.'' `` Clearly, the fraternity is out of line,'' <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cobb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner, said an autopsy of <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> failed to reveal any bruises or visible injuries. `` Right now, it looks like he had a cardiac disrhythmia,'' <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said. `` Exactly what precipitated this, we do n't know.'' Hundreds of students, friends and <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> faculty attended a memorial service for <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> on Thursday. Many students sobbed openly during the ceremonies and hugged each other afterward. `` Everybody who knew him loved him,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who said he was <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' best friend in high school. `` I loved him.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said she would campaign to see `` that no more children in this country will die because of hazing. ... <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' mother will work to get it outlawed in all the states. This is utterly ridiculous. ... This is not right.'' <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> called <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> `` a young man with a well of integrity.'' Wreaths lined the front of the stage during the service at a college chapel, and the all-male <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> sang hymns.

 Cable cars returned to the streets of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on Thursday, after being stuck in their barn since an earthquake knocked out electrical power two days earlier. By midday, enough traffic signals were working again so that partial service on the popular tourist attraction could resume. Most of the city's landmarks, including the Golden Gate Bridge, Coit Tower, Mission <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> and the colorful Victorian-style homes, were virtually unaffected by the powerful quake and remained unruffled and picturesque as ever. Automobiles were snaking down the `` Crookedest Street in the World'' of postcard fame, the block of Lombard on <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` The traffic has n't stopped at all, except Tuesday night when they closed the street off because a cable car was stuck at the top of the hill,'' said <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Doty </PERSON>, who lives on the steep, winding street. `` Our electricity is still out, but there are no other problems here.'' Not all the frequently photographed landmarks got through the earthquake untouched, of course. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, big sister of the more colorful Golden Gate, was crippled. Some $ 4,000 worth of glass was broken at the Conservatory of Flowers, a huge greenhouse in Golden Gate Park. At the bayside end of Market Street, the flag atop the Ferry Building was tilted and the tower clock was still stuck on Tuesday's late-afternoon earthquake time, 5:04 p.m. The Mansion Hotel, a Victorian building in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> district, rode smoothly through its second major quake. `` It stood proud, and it's obviously a survivor. It looks fragile but it is n't,'' owner <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritikin </PERSON> said of the building completed in 1887. `` The only damage we found was a crack in a bathroom ceiling.'' <LOCATION> Alcatraz </LOCATION>, called `` The Rock'' by those who did chilly hard time there when it was a federal prison, certainly lived up to its nickname. Tourists _ though very few of them _ in the Fisherman's <LOCATION> Wharf </LOCATION> area Thursday were pointing their cameras at the bleak island in the bay `` We like <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Camenisch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Marthalen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, said as he and his family strolled through Fisherman's Wharf, where there was no power and almost all businesses were closed They were not planning on staying overnight, however. `` We were going to stay at a downtown hotel, but now we're going to stay somewhere else,'' said <PERSON> Camenisch </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Esther </PERSON>. On <PERSON> Nob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, about half the <ORGANIZATION> Fairmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>'s 500 rooms were empty as well as dark Wednesday night. A national business group that had reserved 450 rooms canceled a scheduled meeting. `` I was on the phone starting Wednesday morning to groups with reservations here the next 30 days. News reports have made things sound pretty dismal, and I wanted to let them know the city was not burning down,'' said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, director of sales for the Fairmont. At the Moscone Center, the city's largest convention center, one event ended its run Tuesday. The next, a car dealers' gathering set for Oct. 26, is still scheduled, as well as a convention of 5,000 plastic surgeons beginning Oct. 27.

 A series of at least six earthquakes rumbled across rural north <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> late Wednesday and early Thursday, destroying more than 10,000 homes, killing at least 29 people and injuring more than 150. The quakes, measuring from 5.0 up to 6.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, hit <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION> provinces, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Most of the destruction occurred in <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> province, and the daily quoted a local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official there as saying, `` The problem is serious and the casualties may increase.'' Film footage taken by <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> provincial television showed rescue workers using primitive tools to dig through the rubble looking for victims; makeshift clinics set up outside to treat people with broken bones and badly bloodied heads; people in heavy overcoats huddled around bonfires, and children wrapped in blankets sleeping in straw outside their destroyed homes. Bread and medical supplies were being distributed to the homeless and injured. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily said the army sent 1,000 soldiers to join rescue efforts. The worst quake was centered about 135 miles west of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on the border of <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION> provinces and struck less than 24 hours after a massive earthquake hit the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area, but <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> officials said there was no evidence the temblors were linked. Residents of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> felt the tremors, but no reports of damage surfaced and the bureau said there was no need to take safety measures in the capital. The epicenter was near <LOCATION> Datong </LOCATION>, famous for its Yungang Caves that hold thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> paintings and statues dating to the 5th century. Whether any caves were damaged was not reported. Efforts to reach <LOCATION> Datong </LOCATION> by telephone failed. The <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said an initial quake hit at 10:57 p.m. Wednesday -LRB- 10:57 a.m. EDT -RRB- and measured 5.7 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. At least four others registering 5 or above hit in the next six hours, including a quake of 6 on the scale at about 1 a.m. Thursday -LRB- 1 p.m. EDT Wednesday -RRB-. An aftershock measuring 5.1 hit at 6:29 p.m. -LRB- 6:29 EDT Thursday -RRB-, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. More than 300 lesser aftershocks were recorded. For many hours, almost no details were available from the government or official media about extent of damage. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s prime time national news program gave extensive time on Thursday to Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> inspecting a stadium and a continuing campaign against pornography, but failed to mention the killer earthquake that was felt in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. It takes days for details of many major disasters to be reported, and many, particularly industrial accidents, are still ignored by the official press. The region affected by the Wednesday-Thursday quakes is a dry, windswept farming area, where wheat and other grains are grown and where most homes are built one-story high of unfired clay bricks, vulnerable to collapse in an strong quake. <PERSON> Shanxi </PERSON> also is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s main coal-producing province. Earthquakes are frequent in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Last month one hit southwest <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province, injuring 54 people and destroying 4,000 homes. Five earthquakes with magnitudes registering up to 6.7 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale hit western <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> in June and July, killing 11 people. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s worst earthquake in recent history leveled <LOCATION> Tangshan </LOCATION> in the northeast in 1976, with a magnitude estimated at up to 8.2. The official count listed 240,000 dead, but unofficial estimates put the toll at three times that. That time, it was years before the outside world learned the extent of the catastrophe. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground movement as recorded by seismographs. The open-ended scale is logarithmic, meaning each degree of intensity is 10 times stronger than the last. Thus the 6.9 quake that hit <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> would be 10 times stronger than one registering 5.9. <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhangsun </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> transportation and communications in the quake area remained intact and relief work was in progress, but he gave no details. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday devoted five paragraphs to the tremors in its English-language service, two of which were concerned with saying the quake had nothing to do with the one in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> quake, by contrast, made the evening news Wednesday night. Unlike the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which won wide international sympathy by allowing foreign journalists and relief organizations to go to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> when an earthquake devastated that region last December, foreigners were barred from going to <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION>, where an earthquake killed 730 a month earlier. When reporters asked the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> for permission to cover Thursday's quakes, they were told to write a formal letter of request.

The walkout is not connected to the union's larger strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which began last April. Last June, a bomb was set off at a bridge entrance to the mine, and a July fire resulted in about $ 400,000 damage, <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. Last month, a bomb caused about $ 35,000 damage to a mine ventilation system. Also last month, authorities disarmed a 57-pound time bomb set to explode, <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. Neither the arrested miners nor local union leaders could be reached for comment Thursday night. UMW national spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> said the union was unaware of any evidence implicating the nine. `` In any strike situation, there are many allegations and accusations that turn out not to be true,'' he said.

 Police said they arrested the personal pilot of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s alleged cocaine godfather Thursday and will hold him for extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The pilot, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuesta </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>, is wanted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, national police Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmona </PERSON> said in a news release. He identified <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuesta </PERSON> as the pilot of <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, leader of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel. <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> would say only that <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuesta </PERSON> was arrested in an apartment in northern <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. With <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuesta </PERSON>'s arrest, five Colombians await extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> earlier extradited four others. None is on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s list of the 12 most wanted drug suspects in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. An army official said Thursday the army detained <PERSON> Dairo </PERSON> <PERSON> Chica </PERSON>, a well-known Colombian bullfighter, as a low-level drug trafficker in a raid on a farm outside of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. The official, speaking to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Chica </PERSON> was among four people captured. Press reports said <PERSON> Chica </PERSON> was wanted for extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug-trafficking charges, but the official could not confirm this. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, authorities said they captured the nephews of two Colombian drug kingpins and broke up a ring that flew cocaine into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> via the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and shipped it by boat to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Federal police commander <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON> <PERSON> Valverde </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s narcotics interdiction forces, said the two _ identified as <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, a nephew of <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Isunza </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, a nephew of <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> _ were seized with eight other men Sunday at a clandestine airstrip in the Yucatan President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> resumed extraditions on Aug. 18 following the slayings of a leading presidential candidate, a federal judge, and a police colonel by drug barons. Another federal judge was killed by a gunman in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> on Tuesday, three days after three Colombians were extradited. A group calling itself the Extraditables said in a telephone call to a <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> radio station the murder was in revenge for the extraditions carried out so far. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> says he will not back down in his war on drug traffickers. The traffickers replied they prefer a grave in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to a jail cell in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They killed a governor, bombed two newspapers, killed eight news media employees and set off 164 explosions in an effort to force the government to call off extraditions. The explosions at banks, shopping areas, hotels, schools and government offices have killed 16 people. The latest occurred Wednesday in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s main plaza when a hand grenade exploded, apparently accidentally, and killed the man carrying it. The man was only steps from the building of the national congress. About 17,000 Colombian judges and judicial employees, meanwhile, said they were ending a 72-hour strike Thursday night and will return to work Friday despite the government's inability to address their security concerns. <PERSON> Consuelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, a board member of the court workers' union, said Justice Minister <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Manrique </PERSON> told the board Tuesday the government did not have the resources to increase protection for judges threatened by drug traffickers. `` He told us that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid for us had not arrived and that the government could do nothing for us without it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> by telephone. In September, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration pledged $ 19 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to protect <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s judges. The walkout has paralyzed most courts here since Tuesday. Ms. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said judges and court workers were returning to work with the certainty more of them will be murdered. `` We ca n't shut down the court system for very long because it is just too important,'' she said. `` But the next time one of us is assassinated _ and it is sure to happen _ we will go on strike again.''

 A state grand jury has begun a new investigation into the 1976 car-bomb slaying of investigative reporter <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON>, sources said Thursday. The grand jury has already issued subpoenas for several witnesses, including people in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, said sources familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity. Although the man who planted the remote-control bomb that killed the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> reporter was found guilty and imprisoned, no mastermind has ever been convicted. Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>, who has come under fire for his handling of the <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON> case, declined to comment on any grand jury matter, but confirmed that his office had been working on the <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON> case for more than a year. Witnesses subpoenaed in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> may be entitled to a court hearing before any <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> subpoenas are honored, sources said. The sources demanded anonymity because they feared prosecution under an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> law making it a crime to dislose grand jury matters. <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON> clung to life for 11 days after the bomb went off, repeatedly saying the word `` Emprise,'' an apparent reference to a company later called <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> that runs dog and horse racing tracks. Racing dog owner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> was convicted of murder for planting the bomb that killed <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON>. <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, testifying at the trial of <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> had asked him to kill <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON> because of the reporter's articles about a wealthy benefactor of <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> unrelated to the company. <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> were convicted and sentenced to death, but the verdicts were overturned on appeal. Attempts to try them again were put on hold when <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> refused to testify again unless he got a better deal from prosecutors. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>'s office then withdrew the deal under which <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> had been sentenced to 48 years in prison in exchange for his earlier testimony, and prosecuted him again. He was convicted and sentenced to death, but a federal appeals court in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> threw out the sentence _ and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s death penalty in general _ as unconstitutional. That ruling has been appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>, a Republican who is up for re-election next year, has come under increasing pressure over the <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON> case. His only announced opponent for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenstein </PERSON>, has made the case a centerpiece of his campaign. <PERSON> Eisenstein </PERSON> on Thursday questioned the timing of the grand jury leak. `` I find it very interesting that there is a grand jury working on it just a month after I pointed out that he had n't done anything about it for 11 years,'' <PERSON> Eisenstein </PERSON> said. `` I'm curious, but at the same time I'm encouraged.''

 The reek of gasoline dripping from flattened cars and trucks mingled Thursday with the aroma from eucalyptus trees splintered by tons of concrete crashing to the streets below. On the railing of the flattened upper deck of Interstate 880, markers of flourescent green, pink and orange spray paint point the way to crushed cars and shattered bodies. The code is crisp and clear: The letters 1DOA signified a body, 2MT a pair of empty cars, a circle and arrow with the number 43 showed a car 43 feet away. Here and there, blood spatters the highway's underside. Two days ago, 3-foot-thick concrete supports turned to dust, 2-inch steel reinforcing bars bent like pipecleaners, and chunks of freeway cascaded like runaway boulders when an earthquake collapsed a mile-long section of I-880, the Nimitz Freeway. Early estimates put the number of dead at 250 people, but by Thursday, officials said they expected the total would be lower _ possibly much lower. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said he would likely appoint a board to look into the failure of the freeway, which was partially reinforced in 1977 to make it less prone to damage from earthquakes. During a live broadcast of the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television show `` 48 Hours'' on Thursday, an angry parent who believes his son may be buried in the Cypress rubble confronted <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. `` Mayor, did you know that you are directly responsible for this here mess, this disaster?'' asked <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rubi </PERSON> said he had been turned away on Wednesday when he asked to climb the freeway structure and search for his son, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON>. The mayor replied, `` I'm sorry, I ca n't answer that question.'' Police took <PERSON> Rubi </PERSON> from the scene in a squad car. <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> jail officials reported he was not arrested. Across from the rubble, just outside the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a salesman who would identify himself only as <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> stood on the sidewalk Thursday, still shaken by what he had seen. `` It just was one single POW!'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said. `` The concrete made so much dust you could n't see anything. `` After you got out here it was so quiet, all you could hear was people screaming. Anybody who could move was getting out. We got some ropes. The thought everyone had was that this was the way it was everywhere. We did n't know how long it would be before help came.'' One who came to help was <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, a firefighter from neighboring <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. `` It was a mess,'' said <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, who returned Thursday to see how the scene appeared in daylight. `` It looks worse to me today. You always look at the dangers, but they do n't affect you so much in an emergency. `` There was cars this tall,'' he said, holding his hand level below his knee, `` and arms sticking out of them. `` At first, I though we should be a lot more frantic, but then I realized there was no way life could be supported in there. `` But we never gave up hope,'' he added. `` It's been proven some people could survive. Some places might not support an adult, but would support a child.'' Chainsaws roared and hammers pounded Thursday as carpenters and ironworkers used 20-30-foot lengths of 12-inch timbers and 16-inch pipe to shore up the bottom deck of the highway. Others on the top deck used heavy machines called concrete nibblers to break holes to reach each crushed vehicle. The concrete railing of the lower deck was being punched out by a huge backhoe fitted with a steel ram to allow rescuers inside. Black soot marked where gasoline had caught fire and burned within the wreckage, out of reach of help. On the sidewalk below, hundreds of expensive bottles of wine and champagne lay unbroken where they had been thrown when a rental truck was pitched from the overpass. Blankets were heaped on the sidewalk in front of a warehouse where injured people had been comforted. Construction worker <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Elfring </PERSON>, wearing an orange safety vest and a hardhat, got up from a cot in a loading bay where he had napped after working straight through from Tuesday, when he came in from <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. `` You sleep a few hours and go back to work,'' he said. `` You try to ignore it -LRB- the carnage around him -RRB- and just do your job.'' A burly carpenter who refused to give his name said he had seen incredible bravery by his fellow carpenters and ironworkers. `` That whole damn structure was shaking when a cat -LRB- caterpillar tractor -RRB- went by and guys were in there shoring up under there,'' he said. `` I saw people crawling in there in places where they were n't sure a branch was holding them up, running torches in places they were n't sure there was gas because they had to. `` Four carpenters worked'til 2 this morning and went to their regular jobs at 7 and they'll be back tonight,'' he said. `` We're here just because we believe in it. <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said he thought the death toll would ultimately be far less than the 250 first estimated. The earthquake hit while many people were already home in front of televisions or across the bay at Candlestick Park for the third game of the World Series between the Oakland A's and the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION>. `` Normally at 5 o'clock on a Tuesday afternoon the traffic in this area would be bumper to bumper,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. `` We thought at first it might be 200 or 300 -LRB- dead -RRB-. `` But it was World Series day and the traffic was light. We might get lucky on this one because of the World Series.''

 In 18 -LCB- years in a meatpacking plant, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellen </PERSON>'s wages have helped build his house, put food on the table and raise two daughters. But, he says, he has paid a terrible price: the use of his hands. <PERSON> Kellen </PERSON>'s hands are too weak to chop wood, much less twist open a bottle. He blames it on years of such jobs as tearing gobs of fat from hogs, repeating the same few steps, struggling to keep pace with hundreds of carcasses an hour. His employer, <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morrell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, says plant safety is improving and is contesting a $ 4.3 million government fine for allegedly allowing dangerous work conditions. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Kellen </PERSON>, 41, who has endured surgery twice on each hand, now sweeps floors at the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, plant. And he's worried. `` I'm sitting here with my hands 37 percent crippled. They're what's got to make my living for the next 20 years,'' he said `` Is <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> going to be there? Are my hands going to get worse? I do n't know who'd be willing to hire me That's what's got me scared. ... It's like going blind slowly.'' Such problems go beyond one man, one company or one occupation. Many union, safety and academic experts say <PERSON> Kellen </PERSON> is an example of an insidious trend in American industry: Companies are producing more, cutting payrolls, modernizing, computerizing _ and creating a more hazardous workplace. `` People are getting hurt more than they ever were,'' argues <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workplace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` They're under more pressure to produce than they ever were. A lot of companies that once were using seven workers to do a job are now asking five to do it. `` The new fat-free American business syndrome is asking those who are left to do too damn much.'' Similar concerns have surfaced from congressional hearings to union organizing drives, in auto, meatpacking, construction, steel and other industries. Experts say automation, competition and the changing business landscape play a role. `` We live in a time of corporate downsizing, mergers and acquisitions and leveraged buyouts that end or greatly diminish many of the modest safety and health programs that exist,'' said a September report by the workplace institute. `` The raiders and downsizers are unwitting participants in our industrial carnage.'' While most workers no longer confront sweatshop horrors and archaic equipment, some experts say a new trend in which technology allows experienced employees to be replaced by those with less training has contributed to increasing dangers. Others disagree, noting large investments that companies, including the Big Three automakers, are making to improve plant designs. They also cite giant government penalties against lead, paper, meatpacking, construction and other firms that are serving as a deterrent. `` I think workplaces are generally safer,'' said <PERSON> Berrien </PERSON> <PERSON> Zettler </PERSON>, deputy director of compliance programs at the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON>'s group says <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> has improved, but he cites government numbers: the average number of workdays lost due to on-the-job accidents for each 100 workers rose from 58.5 days in 1983 to 69.9 days in 1987. And the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> says permanent work-related disabilities rose from 60,000 in 1986 to 70,000 in 1987. Safety experts speculate conditions may be even grimmer because companies underreport injuries to avoid <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> inspections. In fact, the government has cited <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and others for alleged recordkeeping violations. Ironically, some trace rising injuries to economic prosperity, especially in steel. One steelworkers' local says its injury rate nearly doubled when overtime peaked. `` When you're tired and you work in a dangerous operation, fatigue is going to lead to accidents,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>'s health and safety director. A 1988 <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> study found nearly 93 percent of injury increases in durable goods industries could be explained by overtime and employee turnover. Those are n't the only culprits. `` Automation is increasing and the workers who performed a variety of the jobs are being replaced by machinery,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, research director at the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` The jobs that are left are not as complicated ... -LRB- and -RRB- increasingly treat people as robots ... -LRB- and treat -RRB- arms and hands like they're part of a machine. But you ca n't oil a person's arm or hand.'' Workers who cut, chop or pull thousands of times daily have developed painful and sometimes disabling hand, arm and wrist ailments, known as repetitive trauma disorders. The most severe form is called carpal tunnel syndrome, a thickening or swelling of tendons in the wrist. Repetitive trauma disorder cases _ including hearing loss _ soared from 26,700 to 72,940 from 1983 to 1987, the government says, though some attribute part of that to heightened awareness. Much publicity has focused on meatpacking where, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> says, production jumped nearly 20 percent in the last five years while production employees dropped by almost 10,000. `` When line speeds are increased and the workforce is decreased in the name of efficiency, injuries go up,'' said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkowitz </PERSON>, the union's health and safety director. Meat and poultry workers, some of whom have testified before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, have complained about treacherously fast production lines, where meat flies off damaged conveyor belts and blood splatters in their faces. They have described cysts, infections and crippling hand and back pains that make it hard to lift their children, comb their hair or hold a glass. Former poultry employee <PERSON> Lillie </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> worked as a packer and leg cutter for nearly a decade, making thousands of cuts a day. She had surgery three times on her hands, has arthritic legs and says she ca n't scrub floors or lift heavy pots. `` I feel bitter and angry,'' she said. `` Ai n't no job I can get where I can use my hands occasionally.'' Workers such as Miss <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> often do n't have many options, either because of the scarcity of job opportunities or limited education. Another injured worker, <PERSON> Bev </PERSON> <PERSON> Whaley </PERSON>, said she had surgery on her right hand because of her job at the Morrell plant in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. She said a doctor told her she'd have to `` learn to live with it. I wanted to take a baseball bat and smash his hands and tell him he'd have to learn to live with it. Her union local claims assembly line speeds have increased in many areas; for example, in the beef kill department _ where the animal is knocked out, its throat slit, the hide pulled off and the body split in half _ the hourly rate jumped from 105 an hour in 1979 to 193 in 1986. Said co-worker <PERSON> Kellen </PERSON>, `` You're just pushed to the limit,''

 But companies dispute the charges. Poultry producer <ORGANIZATION> Perdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> recently estimated repetitive trauma disorders at its plants at less than 1 percent. And though <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> contends <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> knew conditions were causing injuries but did nothing, company spokesman <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> said safety-improvement efforts were being made and the agency reviewed records during an atypical time _ a period that included a strike. In 11 months, records showed 880 of 2,000 workers sustained repetitive strain injuries. <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> said there are no quick-fix programs for such injuries. `` It's going to take a lot of hard work,'' he said. `` Our progress has been dramatic.'' <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> says injuries at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> fell per 100 workers from 70.5 in January 1988 to 13.48 in July 1989. <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> attributed the high injury rate to the hiring of replacements and other strike effects; for the decline, he credited outside consultants, workers and supervisors. But <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyon </PERSON>, union local president, said he has n't seen any safety progress and said company numbers are `` totally inaccurate.'' He also contends a program providing prizes for injury-free records encourages people not to report them. <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> is n't the only meatpacker to come under government scrutiny. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> also fined the nation's largest meatpacker, <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, but a $ 5.7 million penalty was reduced to $ 975,000 after the company agreed to conduct a three-year safety program to reduce motion injuries. A recent workplace institute study of several large penalties found <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> had bargained fines down from $ 29.3 million to $ 9.5 million. And in cases where <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> fines are smaller _ in the thousands of dollars _ the agency `` is not effective in providing the stimulus employers need to properly deal with safety and health,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, a former official of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. `` The bottom line in business is the dollar bill.'' <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Zettler </PERSON> said his agency usually does n't reduce penalties by more than half. In <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION>'s case, he said, `` we believe the significant reduction was justified by what we were getting back.'' <PERSON> Zettler </PERSON> also conceded <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> does n't have staff to inspect all hazardous places annually and it may cost more to comply than pay a penalty. `` If it takes us 15 years to get there, the guy has saved that investment for 15 years,'' he said. But he says his agency has increased safety awareness and most major companies have health experts. Many also have hired safety design experts. One is the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>'s Center for Ergonomics. Director <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON> believes it's simplistic to blame productivity alone for increased injuries and says corporations are paying more attention to these concerns. But one union local disagrees. At the <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludlum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, plant in <LOCATION> Brackenridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, maintenance division injuries jumped from 27 percent to 45-47 percent during four heavy overtime months in 1988, said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Mochak </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> local 1196's safety chairman. `` People tend to overlook a lot of safety procedures,'' he said. `` They're lax in wearing safety equipment. ... All they want to do is get the job done as quickly as possible.'' A spokesman for the specialty steelmaker said the company tries hard to limit overtime and has no serious safety problems. Productivity also has been an issue in construction, said <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> NIOSH </ORGANIZATION> official who now works at a firm that trains hazardous waste cleanup workers. `` It's been getting worse for the last several years _ the economic pressures, the greater and greater emphasis on cutting costs,'' he said. `` It's ` Get it done faster.' If you're laying a pipeline, you save money as a contractor by not putting in proper shielding or shoring in the trench.'' He said in 96 percent of trench cave-in deaths he studied at <ORGANIZATION> NIOSH </ORGANIZATION>, there was no shoring or sloping. Shortcuts in the name of efficiency are ultimately uneconomical, said <PERSON> Berkowitz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. `` Any gains made by pushing people will be eaten up by high turnover and worker compensation.'' As for <PERSON> Kellen </PERSON>, he has agreed to a workers compensation settlement of more than $ 16,600. But he asks: `` What's the price on your hands? You've got to provide for your family. There was a time when everybody thought of retiring there after 30 years. I do n't look for any future there at all. It's a sad deal.''

<HEAD>Foreign Priests Bolster Ranks of U.S. Catholic Clergy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto, Graphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 With enrollments in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> seminaries flat and the supply of foreign-born Irish dried up, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is seeking non-traditional sources to ease a worsening shortage of priests. Clergy from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and other nations have been coming to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to provide sacramental help to a new generation of immigrants. `` American bishops _ they want priests. They do n't care whether they speak with a Gaelic brogue, a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> accent or a Polish accent. They want priests,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Koper </PERSON>, rector of a seminary for Polish priests in <LOCATION> Orchard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. While many welcome the new priests for their ability to serve immigrants from their native lands, other <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leaders worry _ that the newcomers will struggle with the more liberal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> church and that they're being used to stall discussion on other solutions to the clergy shortage, such as opening the priesthood to women and married men. `` I think it's an approach to the priest shortage, and I think there are other creative ways,'' said Sister <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directors </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think we can find resources withi our Catholic community.'' While diocesan ordinations increased this decade in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, they continued to decline in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, falling from 593 priests ordained in 1980 to 470 in 1987. Nearly two-thirds of all American priests were ordained within local dioceses, while the other third were ordained by religious orders. A study by the <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> said last year the number of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> seminarians declined from 8,885 in 1965 to 4,063 in 1985. The study further estimated the brotherhood of priests would decline 40 percent by the year 2000. The total number of American priests has dropped to 53,000 this year from 59,200 in 1970. The shortage of priests has forced some <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches to merge congregations or to close for good. A parish that might have been served by five priests may now be down to one or two. The ratio of worshipers to priests has gone from about 700 per priest in 1955 to almost 1,000 today. From the waves of Irish priests who arrived in the 19th century _ the so-called `` <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'' connection _ to the immigration of Italian priests early in this one, plenty of historical precedent exists for the new wave of foreign-born priests to follow their flocks overseas. `` The only change is it's 1989 rather than 1889,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON>, editor of CRUX, an international newsletter for clergy and religious people. `` We've become ethnically conscious again, so we may want to have a Polish priest running a Polish parish, or an Italian priest running an Italian parish.'' No hard figures exist on the number of foreign priests who have entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in recent years, but 1,000 is `` probably a good guess,'' according to the Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Zendzian </PERSON>, associate director of <ORGANIZATION> Migration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. The conference has just begun negotiations with bishops from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for an exchange of priests. <PERSON> Zendzian </PERSON> said this latest wave of non-European immigration is different. `` In previous migrations, priests came with their people and it just worked out,'' said <PERSON> Zendzian </PERSON>. `` We've seen this day and age so many different people who have come from so many different countries in such a short time.'' For example, he said, there are 1 million Filipinos in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an estimated 85 percent of whom are <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. If priests are not sensitive to their needs, <PERSON> Zendzian </PERSON> said, `` they strip away their old culture, their old value system, then they strip away their faith, and they're left with nothing.'' Some bishops also say they value the mix of faith and alien culture offered by foreign priests. `` The richness that we have from other countries, from other cultures, is very good for us,'' said Auxiliary Bishop <PERSON> Augustin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> of the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` I think culture is the door to communication.'' At the SS. <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Methodius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION> for Polish priests in <LOCATION> Orchard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, enrollment has grown from 10 students in 1983-84 to 75 this year. Most were born in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where the number of seminarians increased from 5,325 in 1978 to 8,069 in 1987, according to <LOCATION> Koper </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where more than 2 million Polish-speaking Catholics live, diocesan bishops want to add 75 Polish-speaking priests to the 2,250 already here, <PERSON> Koper </PERSON> said. But others say the influx of foreign priests may create problems in a church that has grown more liberal since the Second Vatican Council ended in the mid-1960s. The hierarchical Catholic church has evolved into one in which laypeople play major roles in everything from running church schools to distributing communion. The Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Brink </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Covington </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Priests </ORGANIZATION>' Councils, said the `` real problem is cultural.'' While the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> church has moved toward shared responsibility among bishops, priests, religious and laity, `` In a lot of other countries the priest does everything.'' The Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennesey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> historian at <ORGANIZATION> Canisius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the risk in importing foreign clergy was that `` you tend to keep priests cut off in the form of a caste.'' <PERSON> Hennesey </PERSON> said there was another message: `` This thing seems to say: Any priest will do.'' The Rev. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkmoeller </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>' Secretariat for Priestly Life and <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The last thing any ministry needs is just plain, old warm bodies.'' Brinkmoeller and others say the church should be exploring other options beyond foreign priests, such as consolidating additional parishes or aggressively selling the priesthood to young men as a positive, active calling. <PERSON> Hennesey </PERSON> and Sister <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> suggest dropping the barriers to married and women priests. `` I wonder if this is a sign from providence we have to look that way,'' <PERSON> Hennesey </PERSON> said. `` As an overall solution, I do n't see why we ca n't consider we're being moved in the direction of ordaining married men.''

<TEXT>
 Those whose youthful ambitions were nourished by <PERSON> Horatio </PERSON> <PERSON> Alger </PERSON> might not find much new in this story, but a few adult cynics might very well be surprised. It really is true that long hours, hard work and good service are keys to entrepreneurial success. You are assured of this by a detailed, three-year study of nearly 3,000 business owners and companies. The study takes its place in a long list of similar works, all aimed at understanding American entrepreneurs, considered a curious, even mysterious breed by scholars, and just common-sense folks by themselves. In earlier analyses, the entrepreneur was found, among other things, to have who moved to _ rather than being born in _ the area of success, to have delivered newspapers, been a so-so student and to have experienced need. Whether such findings are sound or have significance is another matter, but the latest, by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, has the ring of truth. It did turn up at least one finding not revealed by the many earlier studies, that long hours on the job do indeed make a positive difference, but that extreme hours apparently erode entrepreneurial effectiveness. `` Long, but not excessive hours, make a difference,'' according to the Federation, which claims membership of more than 570,000 small and independent business in all 50 states. `` Small Business'' is a poorly defined category, sometimes used to include all companies not among the top 1,000 in gross income, but the Federation's membership ranges all the way down to sole proprietorships. Its research arm found that 80 percent of those who worked between 60 hours and 69 hours a week remained in business after the first three years, a period in which many startup companies fail. However, the survival rate of those who worked more than 69 hours a week actually dropped to 75 percent, while those who worked fewer hours fell to 76 percent. While the federation did n't say so, fatigue could be a critical factor in the effectiveness decline, because more than 69 hours is double that of many wage-earners and translates into 10 hours a day seven days a week. Of the companies studied, more than three-quarters succeeded. The owner's average age was 35 years, with a working spouse and no more than five previous jobs. Of these successes, 90 percent said they would do it again. Based on their experiences, it was determined that quality service is more important than low price, that success is enhanced by positive attitudes, and that it is important to have had prior experience with the product involved. The importance of service over price was pronounced. Those whose companies emphasized better service showed an 82 percent success rate, compared with those who adopted a low-price strategy. As expected, the quality of financing played a big role in the success or failure of the companies involved. Too little capital shows up in almost every survey of small-business failure, and this one was no exception. What motivated the entrepreneurs? More than three-quarters agreed that it was to have greater control over their lives, closely followed by `` using my skills and abilities,'' and `` building something for my family.'' Less than half agreed with the statement `` earning lots of money.'' That kind of reward, Mr. <PERSON> Alger </PERSON> might have suggested, is simply the just recognition of ambitious, hard-working people who seek to serve.

<HEAD>Billy Crystal Takes New Act to Old Country</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Last April, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> tries a few jokes on a small audience. Bomb City. Uh-oh, he thinks, I need to see what works, `` but where am I going to break in? At Catch a Rising Czar? At the Impravda?'' He thinks this way because he is in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at the time. A rough place for an American comic to break in a new act. But anyone who survives `` Saturday Night Live,'' `` Soap'' and publicity tours for `` When <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Met </PERSON> <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> ...'' is clearly of sturdy stuff. Crystal returns to Mother <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> in August. It results in a 90-minute show. Called `` Billy Crystal _ Midnight Train to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' it's getting five <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> cable showings that start Saturday It's a mix of comic fantasy, a bit of jazz and a tracing of roots. In addition to teaching one <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> audience how to do The Wave, he does a short, but memorable skit as Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and maverick Soviet politician <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> in a fierce argument. Instead of mimicking their voices himself, he does it with big-band jazz riffs on old <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> recording, `` Got the Spirit.'' `` They went nuts with that because it was so timely,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION>, who also in the show plays a jazzman, <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, a combination of several famous musicians he actually knew as a kid. His knowledge of jazz and decision to attempt a comedy show in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, despite initial worries, may stem from several factors. One of his grandmothers came from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He also is the nephew of a man who founded <ORGANIZATION> Commodore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, a label devoted to Dixieland. His father used to produce jazz concerts. As a kid in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, he learned the rudiments of clarinet from a jazz great, Pee Wee <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>. He met <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> when he was 5, grew up around jazz folk, all friends of his father and uncle. `` Those musicians made me want to be a performer,'' said Crystal, now 41. `` The house was always full of them, always smelled of bourbon and brisket.'' He achieved his boyhood goal. But when it came time to visit the land of his relatives, to perform there, he wanted first to case the place, try a few things there. His first trip left him discouraged. The reason? `` Well, there's no sense of humor there that makes any sense to me. To my kind of comedy. What I like to do. I'm talking about live on the stage. How would that work?'' He kicked ideas back and forth with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON>, who eventually directed his show. Finally, <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> said, he hit on a comedy-fantasy concept `` and started really tracing my roots back, found how deep they went. `` And then the show became more than a comedy show.'' Early in the program, he does a stand-up routine on a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> stage, in front of an audience, many of whom obviously appear to understand English. But he opens by speaking fluent-sounding Russian. Although he has the ear of a good mimic, he does n't know the language, he said. `` I had a good coach,'' he explained. But he admitted he found Russian `` a tough language. There's a lot of coughing and spitting ...'' Still, he said, `` I wanted to come out speaking Russian, and not slow and loud the way people do with foreigners. I wanted the people to know my roots are there.'' Although his two Soviet trips were for the purpose of a show that hopes to make people laugh, Crystal found what he saw of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a little sad, a little unsettling, despite many reports of change for the better there. `` There's a joke in the show that the place is so gray that <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> should buy it and colorize it,'' he said. `` You feel that there. There are some beautiful things to see. `` But there's an eeriness ... that there's a sadness among the people. You just feel it, this fog that is around everybody.''

 Blues singer <PERSON> Big </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was fresh out of jail when he cut his first album for Arhoolie Records one October day in 1960. It was one of the most emotional blues sessions <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Strachwitz </PERSON> has ever recorded. `` He was just fierce,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Arhoolie </ORGANIZATION> owner recalled. `` He had jail on his mind, and everything was going bad. I mean that's the blues. That's pure blues.'' For more than three decades, the German-born <PERSON> Strachwitz </PERSON> has wandered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> holding scores of impromptu recording sessions, capturing some of the greatest blues, Cajun and Mexican-American musicians _ as well as many obscure artists _ for his Arhoolie Records label. `` I do n't think these people today with 10 million tracks could have done a ... thing more than what I did with a -LRB- <PERSON> Capps </PERSON> -RRB- condenser microphone,'' <PERSON> Strachwitz </PERSON> said. `` But of course, these were all acoustic instruments.'' Record collectors know his Down Home Music store, which shares a building in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cerrito </LOCATION>, about 20 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, with Arhoolie. The place is a record mecca for fans of folk, blues, country and world music. But unlike the big retailers, tapes and compact discs still represent the minority of sales. Down Home ships albums nationwide through detailed mail-order catalogs that feature reviews _ some good, some bad _ for the records it carries. <PERSON> Strachwitz </PERSON> also has produced and co-directed films about music with director <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON>, whose studio is adjacent to Arhoolie, and he is working on a book about <PERSON> Lydia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, the famous Mexican-American singer. But <PERSON> Strachwitz </PERSON> does n't spend much time in the record store. He bought the building more than 20 years ago with proceeds from rock band Country <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and the Fish's hit `` I'm Fixin' to Die Rag,'' to which he held the publishing rights. The one-time high school German teacher and avid record collector _ he has at least 22,000 records stashed in something called `` the vault'' _ now faces the task of putting more than a hundred recordings made over 30 years, plus scores of others he's released, onto compact disc All for a business he says has never been very profitable. `` I never went at it as a business. That's where I'm somewhat different than most,'' <PERSON> Strachwitz </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I never thought about merchandising or that this stuff was a product. I began to realize this country was constituted of all kinds of people from all kinds of backgrounds.'' In the late 1950s, he saved money he made teaching and headed east one summer to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He recorded a handful of performers, then returned to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and formed a record label. `` I learned to splice 12 songs together, two sides of a record, roughly 20 minutes a side,'' he said. `` Then I sent that to a guy who cut an acetate master. From that the plates were made. And then they started pressing the plates. Then you made the jacket.'' He found musicians on street corners, bars and fields. Artists such as <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>, Big <PERSON> Mama </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chenier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ducet </PERSON> owe at least part of their status to <PERSON> Strachwitz </PERSON>. He found Arhoolie's first artist, <PERSON> Mance </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipscomb </PERSON>, while driving near <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Another, Black Ace, he found by asking locals whether they knew of any good guitar pickers. `` I'd stop on street corners. There'd be guys playing dice and I'd walk up and ask them, ` You guys ever heard of a guy named Little Brother?' They'd usually just stare at you and say, ` What you want with him?' They figure you're a bill collector or something. `` So this one guy said, ` Yeah, he's hangin' around with Black Ace.' That name was on my list that <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, a blues fanatic friend, had sent me. They said he comes to this tavern right around the corner every afternoon about 5 o'clock. `` That's how I met Black Ace. That was another record.'' <PERSON> Strachwitz </PERSON> traces his love of blues to his boyhood in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where he first idolized bluesman <PERSON> Lightning </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> after hearing his single `` Hello Central'' on radio station KFVD. In 1959, he visited <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> for the first time in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, and a year later he returned, hoping to record <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>' music. `` At that time I decided I wanted to make a record label because I wanted to document Lightning Hopkins in the beer joints, the way he sounded. I was never able to do that. I did n't have the technical equipment. I did n't have the money.'' He got his chance later in his career when he took <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> into a recording studio. By the time <PERSON> Strachwitz </PERSON> made his first recording, he had teamed with fellow blues fanatic <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, a `` playwrite-cab driver'' from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. After asking around, the two found bluesman <PERSON> Lipscomb </PERSON> at his home in <LOCATION> Navasota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` We just turned the machine on and he played one song after the other. They usually give you their best,'' <PERSON> Strachwitz </PERSON> said. `` It was just a little shotgun house, with his wife and a number of grandchildren.'' In 1963, <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> introduced <PERSON> Strachwitz </PERSON> to <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chenier </PERSON>, who was playing little bars in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s French section. `` I always tried to get him to play his French music, but he always wanted to play rock' n' roll.'' <PERSON> Chenier </PERSON>, one of Arhoolie's best-selling artists, died in 1987. Over the years, <PERSON> Strachwitz </PERSON> has improved his equipment, but he still prefers taping acoustic instruments with simple recording devices. More and more, he is forced to take bands into the studio to cut albums. His current best seller is the Cajun band <PERSON> Beausoleil </PERSON>, featuring fiddler <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ducet </PERSON>. <PERSON> Strachwitz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ducet </PERSON> has much of the spontaneity and character of the singers he found in remote areas during the 1960s.

<HEAD>Anthologist Hopes for a Weapon Too Big To Throw</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Books as well as rocks and guns have long been weapons in the feuds that have riven <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Seamus </PERSON> <PERSON> Deane </PERSON>, nearing the end of his work on one of the biggest books of all, an anthology of 14 centuries of Irish writing, hopes it will be simply too large and too inclusive to hurl at an enemy. <PERSON> Deane </PERSON>, a professor of English and American literature at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dublin </ORGANIZATION>, is general editor of `` The Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing, 550-1990,'' to be published in April by <ORGANIZATION> Faber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Faber </PERSON>. In two volumes and 3,000 pages, the anthology will include examples of writing in early, medieval and modern Irish, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, Latin and English. <PERSON> Deane </PERSON> stresses `` writing'' in the title because he has included magazine and newspaper articles, oral histories, attempts at literature that could hardly be called great and commentaries about <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> by English notables including <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON>, who led a bloody military expedition through <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` This immense and distressing work,'' as <PERSON> Deane </PERSON> calls it, is inevitably a political document, an argument against anyone _ republican, loyalist, <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, Celt, <PERSON> Gael </PERSON>, Scots-Irish, Anglo-Irish _ who would stake an exclusive claim to being Irish. `` We are not trying to say, in fact we are refusing to say, that there is some metaphysical essence called ` Irishness' that is as visible in a 9th century poem as it is in a play by <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Casey </PERSON>. We're not interested in that, because we do n't believe in the existence of it,'' said <PERSON> Deane </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, during a recent visit to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` The anthology is a serious attempt to try to introduce to people the idea of a culture that was so rich and diverse that it can not be appropriated by any one group.'' The anthology was sponsored by Field Day, founded in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> in 1980 by playwright <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Friel </PERSON> and actor <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rea </PERSON> as a traveling theater company. It expanded into publishing in 1983 with a series of political pamphlets, and is widely regarded as the finest cultural response <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> has produced against the violence that has torn the province. <PERSON> Deane </PERSON> described the anthology as a definition of Irish writing; of repossession of Irish-born authors such <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilde </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterne </PERSON> who are prominent in English letters; and of decolonization. `` It is important that this should be an exemplary act of showing how you can retain cultural intimacy and links with the colonizing power while at the same time not learning to think of yourself as having an ancillary, marginal or junior role to that power,'' <PERSON> Deane </PERSON> said. However, he also detects in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> a tendency to fall into a trap of colonial self-image: `` They do n't know where they are or where they came from, and they invent fake origins that exclude many people whom they have to live with.'' Ultimately, he argued, this process of inventing origins and excluding late-comers makes the `` others'' less human, and thus suitable targets for murder. The anthology is intended, <PERSON> Deane </PERSON> said, to `` provide material that will show the stupidity and the brokenhearted terminus to which sectarianism leads, and how sectarianism can only be justified by a certain kind of deliberate, fostered, nurtured ignorance of what in fact has happened, what contributions have been made by various groups over the centuries to the culture.'' One section will be devoted to Protestant political oratory in the north in the 19th and 20th centuries. It will also take note of an <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> literary tradition _ `` a literature, alas, that is not known to many Protestants.'' One important figure in that tradition is Sir <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, `` one of the first to try to combine in his writings a plea for Irish cultural unity which at the same time would allow maintenance of the political union with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Deane </PERSON> believes the anthology will demonstrate that the Republic of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> does not have a culture distinct from that of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and he sees that as a rebuke to southern provincialism. `` There is a section called ` Provincialism and Censorship,' centering in the 1930s and 1940s, and is about those writers such as -LRB- <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Faolain </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Flann </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Devlin </PERSON>, who in a sense find that the atmosphere in the south was suffocating,'' he said. `` They shut the doors on the minds in the south, they exported the young people and by the 1950s it had become a kind of semi-geriatric society with most of its young energy drained away and the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church ruling the roost, and the intellectual life in a dreadful state of disrepair.''

<TEXT>
 A great blue heron, its craned neck and long bill poking through the morning mist, feeds along the wooded shore of a strip-mine lake. Not far away are watchers armed with binoculars, cameras and video cameras. But it's not the heron they're watching _ it's dozens of out-of-state trash trucks rumbling up to the Center Point Landfill, feeding the earth-movers whose drone shatters the idyll a half-mile from the lake The `` dump patrol'' _ including teachers, miners, teen-agers and retirees _ was organized by <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, whose dream of a quiet, rural life also has been shattered, by fears of a mountain of garbage imported from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. `` Until the out-of-state waste stops, we're going to be out here,'' said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 33, whose troops have logged nearly 1,200 rigs from 140 companies in the 11 weeks since they started keeping track. The landfill operators have called it harassment. `` I have a substantial investment in the landfill. I'm not going to be doing anything to jeopardize that,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey-based </LOCATION> businessman who is a partner in the Center Point landfill and others near <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wabash </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said that if a cleanup is ever needed, officials will have names they need by tracing license plates and companies logged by the dump patrol. <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and their family moved into their home on 25 acres outside this western <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> town 2 -LCB- years ago. The lifelong area residents wanted their children to grow up here, too, near the five-acre lake on their land that attracts the herons, geese and other wildlife. `` It was our dream house. We knew in life we could n't ask for anything more. It was like having a vacation every night,'' <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> said. Then last year, <PERSON> John </PERSON> came home from work one day and said developers proposed a landfill on the property adjacent to theirs, a few hundred feet from their lake, across the road from Center Point Landfill. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> feared toxins would leak through abandoned mine shafts to their lake and property. Last October, she formed HOPE, <ORGANIZATION> Hoosiers </ORGANIZATION> Opposing Pollution of the Environment, and tried to reach all of approximately 750 people who live within two miles of the dump. She figures 60 percent of the families now are members. `` I got people upset. I got people concerned and worried.'' She also got them to have local land-zoning changes approved that stopped that landfill. It proved to be an empty victory. Last November, Center Point Landfill got a state permit to accept asbestos, which causes cancer and is being removed from buildings across the country. It also began accepting limited shipments of trash from out of state. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> landfill space is dwindling and communities must ship refuse elsewhere. The landfill's neighbors objected. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, whose family owned the site, said some people called state officials to report suspected but unfounded infractions. He began talks with a group headed by <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, and a sale was completed in July. Since then, trucks carrying out-of-state trash have rolled into Center Point. Some days, as many as 30 trucks queue up at the dump, motoring to the top of a hill and unloading refuse that bulldozers cover with dirt. `` We knew the landfill was sold, and then one morning we saw 30 or 40 trucks were going by. That kind of made all of our nightmares come true,'' said <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` I do n't see how our state officials can have this go on,'' said patrol member <PERSON> Forest </PERSON> <PERSON> Reece </PERSON>, a 78-year-old retired custodian and factory worker. `` My God, I think it's horrible myself.'' <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> apparently can do little. Federal laws forbid one state from refusing to accept trash from another state. The <ORGANIZATION> Solid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has given preliminary approval to a plan to track the amount and origin of the trash, but it faces public hearings and other steps before it goes into effect. <PERSON> Bedwell </PERSON>, 37, began taking out-of-state garbage a year ago out of fear that if a new landfill opened across the road it would steal his business. He began taking asbestos because it was an opportunity for the family business to grow. `` I did n't take anything hazardous,'' he said, adding that his asbestos operation met the highest state and federal requirements. <PERSON> Bedwell </PERSON> said he tried to talk to members of HOPE and show them how the landfill operated, but, `` They did n't want to see. They wanted to stand by the road and imagine it. `` I went to school with these people. Now they wo n't even talk to me. These people used to be my friends. It hurts. It hurts real bad.'' Neither <PERSON> Bedwell </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> would say how much was paid for the landfill, but legal papers show <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s group came up with an initial $ 2.7 million. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, a 13-year veteran of landfill operations, said that without the out-of-state business, his landfills would be barely getting by. He said half the refuse accepted at Center Point comes from out of state. `` This is a privately owned business. We have space to sell,'' he said. `` To run a good operation, you need income.'' The landfill employs 12 people with an annual payroll of $ 350,000. It will pump about $ 1 million into the local economy over the next 12 months, he said. `` I think that's a very good neighbor.'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> also said the landfill was safe and, like his operations near <LOCATION> Wabash </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, refuses waste it is not permitted to accept. `` That particular landfill is probably the best geologically sited in the state of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>.'' HOPE's fears about the asbestos are unfounded, he said. While it is dangerous in the air, he said, it `` has zero chance of getting into the groundwater. It is not mobile in soil.'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> acknowledged that HOPE's presence will probably help him run the landfill better. He has tried to work with the group and called <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> shortly after he took over, but she was n't interested in seeing the operation. Now, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said, he has no more time for <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> or HOPE. `` You can not deal with these people rationally. I ca n't be distracted by them. They're interested in closing the landfill, true and simple.'' Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, says he will use the photographs taken by <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and her patrol to convince <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that it needs to ban the practice of transporting trash and food in the same trucks. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> plans to introduce legislation to bar refrigerated trucks from hauling landfill waste, ban waste transporters from hauling food, and require landfill operators to have truck-cleaning procedures. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> sent him pictures of refrigerated trucks unloading garbage at the landfill during the summer. `` Four different truckers told us they hauled beef on hanging meat racks from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> after making trash runs,'' she said. `` One thing that really upset us was when truckers showed us live maggots in the back of non-refrigerated trucks that had gone through the landfill's washing procedure.''

<HEAD>Suburu Legacy: Roomy Wagon With Spaciousness, Easy Handling</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Beware of the 1990 <ORGANIZATION> Subaru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legacy </ORGANIZATION> LS AWD wagon. It could make you forget all about buying a minivan. I know. Minivans are the hot ticket. Station wagons are supposed to be passe. But compact sedans also are popular, a la the Toyota Camry and <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> Accord, and <PERSON> Subaru </PERSON>'s Legacy wagon feels just like a sedan with the utility of a little van. The Legacy LS all-wheel-drive test wagon drove like a sedan, handling well and accelerating with steady power. It seated five with relative ease, just like a decent-sized sedan would, and there was no stepping up to get inside. And the Legacy had 71 cubic feet of cargo space in back, with the split rear seats folded down. That's more than the 62.7 cubic feet you get by removing the rear-most seats of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>' new minivans, though not as much as the 111.2 cubic feet you get in those vans if you take out both sets of rear seats. Still, the Legacy also had full-time four-wheel-drive, an alternative not yet offered on the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> minivans or even <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s popular minivans And the Legacy test car came standard with a 2.2-liter engine that was powerful and yet had only four cylinders, with four valves per cylinder and multi-port fuel injection, rather than the six-cylinder engines sometimes needed to adequately power minivans. No wonder that <PERSON> Subaru </PERSON> nicknamed its engine the `` Boxer.'' It pulls no punches, just delivers the power, eagerly, when teamed with five-speed manual transmission. And it delivered decent fuel economy while powering all four wheels: 20 miles to the gallon in the city and 26 mpg on the highway. Even the automatic transmission gets 20 mpg in the city and 25 mpg on the highway in the four-wheel-drive model, according to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. That compares with 18 mpg and 22 mpg, respectively, for the all-wheel-drive <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Axxess </ORGANIZATION> with four-cylinder engine and automatic transmission. <PERSON> Subaru </PERSON> also was attentive to inside details. The Legacy wagon has a nifty two-cup holder that pulls out of the dash below the ventilation controls. It places cups high enough to be easily reached while driving. Make sure the radio is tuned beforehand, however. It's tough to make adjustments with the cups in the way. A shelf below the ashtray had rubber material that gripped whatever was placed there, so keys, tickets and change did n't slide off. Dashboard gauges had large, easy-to-read numbers and included a tachometer. Front-seat headrests could be adjusted for height as well as how close they were positioned to an occupant's head. The LS model came with a sunroof and cruise control for added comfort. In the cargo area, <ORGANIZATION> Subaru </ORGANIZATION> installed a big plastic tray under the thick cargo rug for tools or small items. A stalk was provided to prop the cargo rug up out of the way as you reached for the spare tire. Replacing the rug was a snap _ literally. Easy snaps hold the cargo covering snugly in place. But be wary of the top tailgate; on the test car, it tended to bounce up quickly and could have hit an unwary bystander. But the real news was passenger space. This is <PERSON> Subaru </PERSON>'s largest car ever, the first with a wheelbase of more than 100 inches. The space was used well, with plenty of room front and back. Legroom was terrific with the front seats moved up, and even when the front seats were all the way back and slightly reclined, my knees cleared the seatbacks. Seating for two was more than adequate in the rear, and three would be snug only if everyone was overweight. But even the person sitting in the middle would appreciate the Legacy design. There was no bump or hard middle in the back seat, just cushioned comfort throughout. <PERSON> Subaru </PERSON> says Legacy buyers are expected to be married, 25-49 years old, with household income of $ 40,000 or more. About 60 percent will be male, and they will have some college education. The company did not have sales projections but has sold more than 6,000 wagons since the Legacy appeared in showrooms in May. Because the Legacy is new, Consumer Reports does not have owner complaints. One final note: The Legacy is the first U.S.-built vehicle for <ORGANIZATION> Subaru </ORGANIZATION>, with some vehicles coming from a new plant in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.

 Right now, the days and nights of television's <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> _ also known as actress <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> _ are spent on a shabby block of West 47th Street, at Broadway's <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrymore </PERSON> Theatre She's starring in `` The Secret Rapture,'' a new play by British playwright <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>, her boyfriend. The drama was written specifically for <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> _ `` For <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, as ever,'' says <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>'s dedication _ and she plays one of its three choice female roles It tells of two sisters -LRB- <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> -RRB- who return home after the death of their father and who must deal with their lives as well as the life of their alcoholic stepmother -LRB- <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> -RRB-. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>, is an ambitious junior minister in the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> government, and <PERSON> Isobel </PERSON>, the role played by <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, is an ineffectual but well-intentioned graphic designer. `` The Secret Rapture'' was a big hit at <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s National Theatre where it was performed by a different cast and with a different director. <PERSON> Hare </PERSON> does the honors here. `` What's hard for some people about <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s plays is that they are not manuals about how to live,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> says. `` Everyone in them, not unlike life, is a mixture of good and bad, strengths and weaknesses. And that's sometimes difficult for mass American audiences to accept.'' She's confident that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> theatergoers wo n't have trouble relating to very English characters and will have an easier time picking up on the family drama than the British politics. `` So many of the characters sound very American, like <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>, who is a real achiever, or her husband <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, a Christian businessman,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> says. `` I thought the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had the corner on that profession and that they were all Southern.'' Whether `` The Secret Rapture'' will succeed on Broadway, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> does n't know, but she has an affection for the character she plays. `` Isobel is a woman sensitive to a certain kind of emotional blackmail, probably a person who's living her life according to the path of least resistance,'' the actress says. `` She is not a victim. She hangs on to her own integrity but, to a fault, <PERSON> Isobel </PERSON> is a good daughter.'' Not unlike the slightly bewildered woman <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> plays on the television series `` The Days and Nights of <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>,'' now seen on Lifetime, a cable channel. `` <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'s'' history is worthy of soap opera, if not sitcom. It began more than two years ago with producer <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON>, for whom <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had done a television pilot that <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> decided not to pick up. They had gotten along immediately. `` We had the same sense of humor _ he was so twisted,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> laughs. `` Then <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> called <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> and without ever mentioning the ` <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>' word, said he wanted to do a series about a single woman in the big city,'' she recalls. What <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON> came up with was `` <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>,'' which premiered on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> during the summer of 1987. Despite cheers from the critics, it never lived up to the network's expectations. What <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> got was an unusual comedy in which <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> struggled to cope with her mother, ex-husband, sister, various boyfriends and life. Some of the time, she did n't succeed. The show, moved from time slot to time slot, eventually was cast off by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and picked up by Lifetime. And instead of being filmed in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, `` Molly Dodd'' is now done in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where its production team can take advantage of the city's theater people. `` The pool of actors here is much grittier, much more interesting,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> says. `` Now we have a little theatrical rep company.'' Most of the show's scripts are written by playwright <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Overmyer </PERSON>, author of `` On the Verge,'' and directed by <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON>, a veteran theater performer who will direct the play `` A Few Good Men'' on Broadway later this season. Everyone took a salary cut when the show moved to cable because the licensing fees are less. `` But it was worth it,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> says. `` What's your choice? Not to do it because you are going to make more money doing something you do n't like?'' The size of the audience on cable is smaller, too _ `` We were worried viewers would n't be able to find us'' _ but people still recognize <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> on the street. `` It's nice, but then <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> is kind of a benevolent personality. It's not like <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carne </PERSON>'s ` sock-it-to-me' girl on ` Laugh In.' They do n't want to see how tough I am. They basically think I'm their neighbor.'' And most do n't think of her as a theater actress. Audiences do n't realize that before there was `` The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd'' or movies like `` Continental Divide'' with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Belushi </PERSON> or TV miniseries like `` Kennedy'' and `` Captains and the Kings,'' there was the stage. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, has extensive and impressive credits, starting with her training at the National Theatre of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. She ended up working at the <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, and in regional theaters across <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including two seasons at the <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` I was an ingenue, so I could always get work because I looked the right way,'' she says. `` A couple years ago I was going in for an audition and I could see this director thinking, ` Oh, this is a television actress, I'm going to cross over,''' she says `` I wanted to take him by the throat and yell, ` Look at my credits.''' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was given six months off from `` Molly Dodd'' to do `` The Secret Rapture.'' If it runs long enough, she'll leave the play next February to resume production of the television series. `` It's very rare to have this much good material to do _ especially material that is written for you,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> says. `` So it's just bad sportsmanship to complain. Just keep your mouth shut and count your lucky stars because it will soon be over.''

 <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> says the worst day in his 40 years with <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> came shortly after he was named president in March 1980, when he realized the No. 2 automaker was in worse shape than he'd thought. `` It was certainly a sobering day,'' he said. `` It was probably the most sobering day.'' The company had just reported a profit of $ 1.17 billion for 1979, the second straight year that profits were down. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s financial slide was accelerating, hurt by rising gasoline prices and rising interest rates, which were making cars less affordable By the time <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>'s first year as <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s president ended, the company had reported a $ 1.54 billion loss. To the outside world, things looked pretty bad. But sequestered from public view in <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> design studios were the cars that would help resurrect the company and make it one of the world's most profitable corporations in less than a decade. First the sleek Thunderbird and later the jelly-bean-like Taurus and Sable models became the weapons <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> used to slam-dunk its way back into the brutally competitive auto business, threatening No. 1 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s dominance. `` What was so striking to me about the Taurus was that it put the stamp of certified acceptance and rightness on the efforts of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> in a fashion that I did not anticipate fully,'' <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said. `` To me, we had started the process long before. `` I thought of the'83 Thunderbird as really, if you will, the benchmark car that really declared that there was going to be a very different direction, specifically in design of automobiles.'' <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> was no stranger to watching cars develop from a sketch sheet to the assembly line. Through the 1950s and 1960s, he rose through the product planning division to become vice president for car planning and research in 1969. In the early 1970s, he was vice president and general manager of the company's truck operations, giving him broad product experience. Between then and the time he was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors on Sept. 8, 1977, <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> was executive vice president for diversified products, which linked the company with suppliers and subsidiaries, and was vice president for international operations. Some analysts have said his role overseeing foreign operations gave him a view of the international automobile industry that has spurred <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> to break out of the Big Three carmaking mold. The introductions of the Taurus and <LOCATION> Sable </LOCATION> _ on the day after Christmas 1985 proved to be the gift that has kept on giving for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. By then, the company was well into a painful cost-reduction program that scrapped the paring knife and instead used a cleaver to eliminate what <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> and his colleagues considered excessive and redundant. At the same time, gasoline prices and interest rates were falling. `` I think it was all of this coming together in that type of car that created almost a sensation that I did n't expect,'' <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said. Earlier that year, <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> became board chairman and chief executive officer. In 1985, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> made $ 2.52 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has been on a roll since the Taurus-Sable introduction, stealing sales and market share from <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, fighting off foreign competition easier than other domestic manufacturers and keeping a lid on manufacturing expansion through the use of overtime instead of expensive new factories. One of the big problems for automakers in the 1990s promises to be overcapacity _ too many assembly lines producing too many cars for a saturated market. It likely will affect <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> less than others. `` If the scenario is roughly what we think it will be _ slow growth, an industry down some, perhaps, from this year _ <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> should be in a pretty good position to deal with most of the problems by fluctuating overtime,'' <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said. It is that outlook of soft growth that has pushed <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> into other directions under <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>'s guidance. For example, the automaker has expressed interest in buying all or part of such well-known European automakers as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> to strengthen its worldwide operations. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> also has made major moves into financial services to cushion the blow of any auto-industry downturn. Last July, for instance, it announced the $ 3.35 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a major provider of consumer financing, from <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> is making no predictions about the level of car and truck sales in 1990 `` We want to see a little bit more of the fourth quarter -LRB- of 1989 -RRB- before we start quantifying next year,'' he said. `` We do think that it's likely to be off some from the 1989 calendar year, but not a dramatic drop.'' In fact, he added, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s sales should continue to grow, which would give it a larger share of a smaller market <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said much of the reason for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s comeback stems from a management meeting in 1984 when the company's leadership adopted `` Company Mission, Values and Guiding Principles'' _ a statement of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s goals. `` I'll always remember <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> II devoting his entire talk to the then new statement of MVGP at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said. `` As he left the podium, he said to me, ` <PERSON> Pete </PERSON>, I hope I gave your new statement of what we want to be a good send off.' `` That really was a certification that we really are going to change. At that point, we were very much in the process of change.'' Under <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>'s direction, the company became the most profitable automaker in history. In 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> made $ 3.29 billion, raised that to $ 4.63 billion in 1987 and set an industry record $ 5.3 billion in profit in 1988. Honors have been heaped on <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> for work in and out of the automobile industry. Yet his office has none of the numerous plaques he has received over the years. In fact, there is little indication, save a life-size bust of the Greek god Mercury by <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Fredericks </PERSON>, that it's the seat of management for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In the place of plaques, certificates and official proclamations are things near and dear to <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Jody </PERSON>. Rocks. Not just any rocks, but minerals collected from all over the world. A case contains raw and finished forms of dozens of minerals _ an emerald from Muzo, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, cinnabar from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hunan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> and imperial topaz from <ORGANIZATION> Minas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gerais </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. In a private meeting room as a centerpiece on a small table, there is an unusually large specimen of twinned quartz. `` My interest is what's beautiful and what's pretty,'' <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said. `` And then you go on to see if it's perfect.''

 <PERSON> Bunting </PERSON> poses another scenario: `` All right,'' he says. `` It's 102 degrees out, you're in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> and you've got 300 people around you now. What are you charging this guy with?'' A Hispanic cop, getting into the spirit, jumps up and confronts her classmate. `` What are you doing? That's my brother. He did n't do nothing.'' The laughter drowns out Bunting. <PERSON> Bunting </PERSON> once gave a lecture to a group of mystery book writers and was deluged with offers to co-author a book. Dr. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, a psychology professor, says he was once teaching a class about schizophrenics and their usual non-violent nature. A cop-student asked: `` Would you like me to show the class the two bullet holes I have in my buttocks from one of those non-violent schizophrenics?'' <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> says that is one of the great strengths of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>. `` We all learn to be tolerant and we learn from each other.'' Meanwhile, back in the ivory tower part of the school, freshmen are wrestling with an English literature survey course, basic mathematics, speech, government 101, much like students at any college. Half of their credits must be in traditional liberal arts courses, but even those have a criminal justice flavor. `` Sometimes, we wish their interests were broader,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracey </PERSON>, head of the anthropology department and an expert on international policing, particularly the criminal justice system in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` But, in another way, it makes it easier to teach here. In theory, all students have some interest in criminal justice.'' Forty percent of <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>'s students come from families that earn under $ 12,000 a year. They are older than most college students and most of them work. About 80 percent receive some sort of financial aid. The undergraduates are 36 percent black, 32 percent white, 28 percent Hispanic. Almost half are women. Due to finances, about a fourth graduate in four years. With work and aid, almost three-fourths stick out 10 to 14 semesters to graduate. Still, about 500 students get their baccalaureates each year. The staff includes <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> detective. She has worked as technical adviser for TV shows. There was a reported contract out on her when she helped bring down drug kingpin <PERSON> Nicky </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>. As head of the internship program and knowing the reality of policing, she advises students: Do n't take internships with private industry security men who are armed, never ride in a radio car, never visit a parolee, never walk with a cop to and from the precinct. There's Dr. <PERSON> Ansley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON>, an anthropology professor who specializes in crack-related violence and street gangs and maintains that crack is not as instantly addictive as it is being portrayed. `` The dealers are controlled users, or sometimes abstinent, and I recently met an 80-year-old grandmother, who has no previous history of alcohol or drug abuse, who is a controlled user,'' <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> says. `` Crack just came on us so fast, there was no time for a body of experiential users to teach others. Now people are coming up with strategies for recreational use of crack. They might mix a little with some marijuana, for instance.'' Is this a rather benign view of crack? `` Not benign,'' says <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON>, `` just a business-as-usual view of underground economies. `` The real danger is the destruction of families and crack does the footwork. The marijuana dealer lasted a long time. Eventually he bought a small bakery or maybe a boutique in the neighborhood. With crack, the money does n't stay here. `` The crack dealer does n't last long. He is either arrested, killed by the competition or he becomes a crack head himself. But when he has the money, he conspicuously consumes, buying fancy imported cars and jewelry. The money does n't go back into the community that generated it.'' Over at the Criminal Justice Center, there is <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, retired <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> detective. With the code name `` <PERSON> Mother </PERSON>,'' he was once the undercover owner of two houses of prostitution. As head of the bomb squad when he retired, he was known as `` Billy Bombs.'' Now working on his doctorate, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> says: `` If it were n't for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>, I would never have gotten my bachelor's and master's degrees Back then, it was the only place a cop could go.'' In the next office sits <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Louden </PERSON>, also working on his doctorate. <PERSON> Louden </PERSON> was the <ORGANIZATION> NYPD </ORGANIZATION>'s chief hostage negotiator. Psychology professor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahn </PERSON> likes to tell about the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> man in a public service administration course. The professor lectured that changes in top leadership should occur at least every 10 years. Loyal to long-tenured <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> man challenged that. So the professor assigned him to write a paper justifying his point of view. Working at his office, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> man did some research on the pros and cons of <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>'s long stewardship, pitching the carbons into the waste basket where another agent found them. The FBI-author agent was greeted the next morning by two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who announced he was under investigation. He explained to the department that this was not a plot. It was homework. An angry <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> was on the telephone immediately to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>: `` What are you going to do about that professor who is trying to undermine me?'' `` I'll tell him you called,'' was the reply of a school that will not suffer intimidation.

 The handsome, charismatic grand dragon of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> was destined for political control of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> until a young schoolteacher looked beneath his sheet. It had, in a sense, fatal consequences for both. It led to her kidnaping and rape; in her humiliation she took her own life. It sent him to prison amidst revelations of corruption and criminal activities behind the facade of a benevolent <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> that brought his empire crashing down. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> retells the story in the miniseries `` Cross of Fire.'' <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> stars as <PERSON> Madge </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberholtzer </PERSON>, a teacher working for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heard </PERSON> is <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON>, the Klansman, in this drama based upon a true story of events in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> in the 1920s. At that time, the <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> was a major political force in a number of states. `` Cross of Fire,'' which <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> will telecast in two parts on Sunday and Monday, also stars <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridges </ORGANIZATION> as the defense attorney and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> as the prosecutor. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendkos </PERSON> directed on location in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> from a screenplay by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crais </PERSON>. `` They meet at a party for state bigwigs,'' said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who played the role during time off from <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` thirtysomething.'' `` She sees it as an opportunity to promote her book program. She meets <PERSON> David </PERSON> and he tells her the Klan does good work and charity. He says the bad reports are merely being spread by outside factions. He's very charismatic and she goes for him.'' Her feelings cause some emotional conflict, yet it's the first love of her life. She tries to set aside her reservations about the Klan. `` He has his own private party with her,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. `` She goes to his house to talk about her book project. When she resists his aggression, he kidnaps her, beats her and rapes her. `` She was n't naive. She was very intelligent. She had been taken in by his charm. There's always the element that love is blind. She wanted to believe that he was good. She tries to kill herself when she realizes the situation she's in.'' Although she died as a result of taking poison, the jury was so enraged at his conduct that they sent him to prison for life for murder. Some of his political cronies also went to jail. No governor dared release him from prison until 1956, after he served 31 years. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> <PERSON> Steadman </PERSON> in the Emmy-winning `` thirtysomething.'' She recently co-starred with <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Belushi </PERSON> in the feature film `` K-9'' and co-stars with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> in the upcoming <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> movie `` My Brother's Wife.'' The latter is based on the play `` The Middle Ages.'' During an interview, she was in costume for a 1940s fantasy sequence for `` thirtysomething'': pants, shirt and tie, a bowler on her head. The studio streets and commissary were filled with extras in period clothing. `` I do n't know what's ahead for Hope,'' she said. `` We talked about her having a second baby. Hope will continue to work and have a career outside of the house. She's very loving and caring and friendly, but sometimes she can be a little too much of those things. `` She would make a wonderful best friend. I do n't want to be her, but I would certainly take her as a friend.'' In the show she's married to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Olin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> is Jewish and the interfaith marriage occasionally causes a few problems. Such as which faith to raise their son in and the celebration of Christmas. `` ` My Brother's Wife' is a romantic comedy and a nice change of pace,'' she said. `` I did it after I completed ` Cross of Fire.' It's about a girl who meets two brothers. One's a straight Republican growing up in his father's mold. The other pushes the limits, played by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, of course. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> plays the other brother. `` I marry the stuffy brother. Then it's about how I and the other brother keep crossing paths. I guess they have this love for each other. She stays faithful to her husband. It's about how people's lives change over the years.'' Her first movie was the 1985 TV movie `` Harry's <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>.'' It was a series pilot in which <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Soul </PERSON> was a businessman and she was a reporter. She moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> with her husband and newborn son just before the 1984 Summer Olympics. She had been doing modeling and commercials and studying acting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> is married to <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who stars in the upcoming <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> midseason series `` Equal Justice.'' He plays a bureau chief in the district attorney's office. She grew up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where her father was defensive football coach at <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. She was accepted at <ORGANIZATION> Barnard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, but opted to go into acting instead. She was born <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> but a younger sister could n't pronounce it and called her `` Melon,'' which was later shortened to <PERSON> Mel </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Reagan Trip Gives Rich Meaning to Word `Honorarium'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is beginning a week in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that gives rich, new meaning to the word `` honorarium.'' Make that very rich. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is said to be picking up a fee of $ 2 million, prompting complaints in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and an inquiry into the government costs for <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection during the trip. The trip, and the flap, came as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> completed action on a bill providing $ 1.8 million to pay the pensions, office and staff expenses of the four living former presidents. That does not include the cost of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection provided to former presidents and their wives. The total cost of that protection is expected to come to $ 12.5 million this year, for three of the former presidents. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> decided in 1985 to give up his <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> bodyguards and pay for his own protection. A spokesman said he now spends about $ 150,000 a year on it. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., wants a review of the benefits bestowed on the men who have served in the White House He called it federal largesse intended to avoid commercialization of the office. `` Perhaps there is an equitable middle ground between the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> situations regarding public funding of protective services for former presidents when they are traveling on profitmaking ventures,'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said. He has arranged to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials next week to talk about the cost of guarding former presidents on trips like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> suggested <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> voluntarily reimburse the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> costs on his trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` I doubt he will do so,'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` If some administrative accommodation can not be reached on this matter, I will introduce legislation to make sure the taxpayer does not get stuck with the bill when our former presidents are off actually increasing their personal fortunes.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanjorski </PERSON>, D-Pa., said it is embarrassing to have a former president picking up big fees from a foreign corporation, then, warming to his topic, called it an `` unmitigated atrocity'' for the government to pay security costs on such a trip `` I do think it is reasonable to ask what it is costing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayers to send a former president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> so that he may engage in conversations with Japanese corporations and gain $ 2 million in personal income for doing that,'' <PERSON> Kanjorski </PERSON> said Tuesday when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the bill including the appropriation for former presidents, who receive annual pensions of $ 99,500. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> completed action on Wednesday, without debate. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife were spending the weekend in an elegantly refurbished Japanese guest house after flying to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Friday on a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> 747 chartered by <ORGANIZATION> Fujisankei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The company is financing the trip at an estimated cost of $ 7 million, including the reported $ 2 million fee to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Neither the company's spokesmen nor <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s have confirmed the size of his payment `` I'm not familiar with those details,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is to meet with Japanese officials and to appear at a series of company-sponsored events, including two speeches followed by question-answer sessions. The Japanese government is co-host for a visit first discussed in 1983, and again in 1988, before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left office. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and a close friend of the Reagans, helped arrange the visit and was traveling with them. About 200 dependents of American military personnel stationed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> flew there for visits on the chartered jet. They are to return to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> with the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 28. The staff, office and expense appropriations provided to former presidents date back 21 years. Costs have been increasing, and there have been proposals to limit that spending during the past five years. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> controversy may give that movement a push. `` We owe our former presidents protection and respect, but do we owe them a guarantee to underwrite whatever future business ventures they may undertake for personal gain?'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> asked. Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, has proposed a bill to limit staff and expense payments to former presidents, and also to provide for annual reviews of their security needs beginning five years after they leave office. `` While they should be rewarded for their service to this country, it is not appropriate to treat them as royalty at taxpayer expense,'' <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> said when he introduced it last summer. The appropriation <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has just passed provides $ 559,500 for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, $ 387,800 for <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, $ 426,800 for <ORGANIZATION> Gerald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and $ 426,700 for <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s assistant said none of the money he gets has been used on his books `` or any other profit-making work.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> does not accept speech fees despite offers that total $ 720,000 a year.

 `` Lost Angels'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>. VHS-Beta, $ 89.98. Rated R. -RRB- <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> youth, <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> would have us believe, are interested only in sex, drugs, alcohol, fast cars, good times and having their own outtasight pads. They love to spend their parents' money, except they're too stupid to really know how to count change and bills, so they steal or hustle or use credit cards These same spoiled, empty and ignorant teens pop up like laminated paperdolls in <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s `` Lost Angels,'' a superficial tale about some seriously disturbed young people and their seriously disturbed parents. Unlike `` Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' and other teen-oriented movies in which irresponsibility and often crime are played for laughs, `` Lost Angels'' takes a hard line and tells us that trashing someone else's property, driving a car into a swimming pool or physically abusing another youngster for being a good student or a virgin just is n't very nice. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Doolan </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Horovitz </PERSON> -RRB- lives with his bloated mother and her bloated second husband in an affluent housing development. Mother snivels about how good stepdad is to take them in. Stepdad talks about discipline but crudely urinates in a punch bowl during a party. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> hangs out with a gang called D.A.B. -LRB- Dead at Birth -RRB-. They're middle-class white kids who have nothing better to do with their time such as read, develop a skill or hobby, get an after-school job or do volunteer work, pursue cultural activities or sports So they adapt Hispanic names and rumble with the 10th Street Gang, a group of Latin kids. When they're not fighting, hurling racial slurs or otherwise trying to prove the superiority of the white race, they break into the homes of vacationing families and destroy everything in sight. Why? No reason, opines one D.A.B. member, it's just something to do. These are kids whose parents have money, but do not have class, values or culture. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> is arrested and sent to juvenile hall after his girlfriend gets high and parks her mother's new car in the family pool. He's sent to <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acres </ORGANIZATION>, a center for troubled youth This is where the filmmakers slip into `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'' land. But the celebrated 1963 <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> movie was an intelligent, case history drama with a degree of authenticity. `` Lost Angels'' has none of those qualities. Even <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> as a tortured alcoholic and committed doctor can not save this video, which is not worth the rental.

 `` Pet Sematary'' -LRB- Paramount Home Video. Priced for Rental. Rated R -RRB- Victims in horror movies have one thing in common: They lack common sense and use bad judgment. In short, they're stupid. `` Pet Sematary,'' the film adaptation of <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s novel, offers a good look at the stupidity factor. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Creed </PERSON> moves his wife, <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON>, daughter, <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON>, and toddler son, <PERSON> Gage </PERSON>, into a house on one of the fastest trucker speed strips in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. The minute they arrive, the wife takes <PERSON> Gage </PERSON> out of his car seat, sets him on the lawn and turns her back on him. <PERSON> Gage </PERSON> wanders towards the highway to wave to a passing truck. A neighbor, <PERSON> Jud </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gwynne </PERSON> -RRB-, snatches the lad out of the jaws of steel just in time. Do the Creeds put up a fence? Do n't be silly. The stupidity factor escalates. During a family picnic, <PERSON> Creed </PERSON> allows <PERSON> Gage </PERSON> to fly a kite and hands him the ball of twine. The baby drops the twine and all watch as the kite runs away. Creed turns his back on the baby, who dashes after the kite and into a truck. But that's not the end of <PERSON> Gage </PERSON>, and only the beginning of the horror awaiting the Creeds. Because the movie's characters do so many misguided things, their behavior and the film's action becomes more predictable and less scary. Everything is neatly laid out in `` Pet Sematary,'' and that's one of the problems; you do n't feel the hairs twitching on your neck. And what's the point of a horror movie if it does n't scare you `` Pet Sematary,'' beautifully photographed by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, explores the human fear of death and dying, and the tempting notion of bringing back the dead. But as <PERSON> Jud </PERSON> says, `` sometimes dead is better.'' Behind the crudely constructed cemetery for pets, which had been made over several generations by children, is an ancient Indian burial ground. Only problem, the soil has `` gone sour'' and the place is evil. <PERSON> Creed </PERSON> finds out when <PERSON> Jud </PERSON> takes him there to bury <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON>'s cat, Church, who had also tap-danced with a truck. But <PERSON> Jud </PERSON> neglects to tell <PERSON> Creed </PERSON> that what returns is n't always the same as what was buried. Sweet and gentle Church returns as Pit Cat. So it is with a certain prescient horror that <PERSON> Creed </PERSON> takes his dead son to the same burial ground. What comes back would make Freddie and <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> proud. There's plenty of slicing and dicing in `` Pet Sematary,'' and some clever special effects by <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> to show spilled brains, severed heads, etc. There's also a campy turn near the end as <PERSON> Creed </PERSON> finally kills the returned <PERSON> Gage </PERSON>.

 Three of <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillen </PERSON>'s children have had hepatitis, one daughter has sores up and down her arms and legs and her husband suffers gastritis. She blames the lack of running water in her home. Many health workers agree that lack of water is the direct cause of the Guillens' illnesses. They also blame a lack of public policy in the last decade for failure to find a remedy for her problems and those of thousands of other `` colonia'' residents living along the U.S.-Mexico border. And they warn that the longer the colonias go without running water, the greater the threat to the health of the rest of the nation as people possibly carrying disease cross the border, many of them migrant workers who travel around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` What we've got is a Third World, part of which happens to be in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s El Paso office. Consider: _ <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s tuberculosis rate is a little less than twice the national average, and 80 percent are traceable to a foreign country _ Each day, 12 million gallons of raw sewage flow into the <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> Another 20 million and 22 million are dumped into the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, respectively, according to an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> report. _ Between 1980 and 1988, the population of <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, across the border from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, rose from 714,000 to 1.25 million; officials estimate anywhere from 83 million to 400 million border crossings each year _ Twenty-five to 50 percent of border residents are living in poverty Despite these grim statistics, health officials, physicians and some politicians have been unable to turn the attention of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to the border and change the living conditions of Mrs. <PERSON> Guillen </PERSON> and other residents. The Guillens have lived for 15 years in a trailer home in a subdivision east of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. They had owned a home in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, but sold it when they moved to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. When they returned they discovered they could buy a lot of land for less than it would cost them to rent a home. They were promised sewer and water hookups would arrive soon. `` It has been a long time, 15 years we have been waiting for water,'' she said. On the stove, a rusting metal bucket holds water for cooking, washing dishes and bathing. Sometimes the family can get water from neighbors a block away with running water, but when they run out at odd hours they must use a backyard pump. Mrs. <PERSON> Guillen </PERSON> fondly recalls when the family lived in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. `` When my kids were very small, they would get full of dirt and I was used to letting my kids play, letting them get dirty and then bathing them. But not here. ... At times I do n't even have water from the pump and the pipes get clogged up. ... We get very tense because there is not even water to fill the tub. You can imagine. With a big family and no water for the bathtub. What do we do? We have to put up with it.'' Sometimes her husband cleans the pipes to the backyard pump and ends up covered with sand, Mrs. <PERSON> Guillen </PERSON> said. `` We take a bath with sand. ... There are a lot of people who take a bath with sand.'' Last year, three of her children got hepatitis. `` Problems with water can cause people to have big infectious sores, that erupt inside your skin. ... Two of my daughters had that same infection years back.'' One daughter's foot was so infected it swelled. The girl spent a summer with an aunt in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> `` and believe it or not her -LRB- sores -RRB- got better, because she was taking a bath with city water.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Guillen </PERSON> speaks reverently of the city water. `` It is clean. Your body feels clean. But with the water she must use, `` I'm not sure if I smell good because that water smells bad.'' Health officials hope a recent conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the recent meeting between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotari </PERSON> will bring some remedy to border living conditions. `` I do n't know ultimately what will come of it, but there is greater awareness, more interest, more action. The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> are pushing the administration to respond,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> health commissioner. Health officials would most like to see a joint U.S.-Mexico commission formed and given consistent funding to coordinate the work of many independent groups trying to alleviate the border conditions. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> voters will be asked Nov. 7 to approve a $ 500 million water bond package, which includes $ 100 million that could be used for subsidized loans and grants to provide water and sewage systems to colonias. The bonds would be guranteed by local governments, water districts or water supply corporations. But even if the money is approved, Comptroller <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON> has said $ 100 million would not be enough to upgrade conditions in all the state's colonias. Others see a solution through more involvement by the `` maquiladora'' _ twin-plant _ industries. These foreign-owned manufacturing centers along the border flourish with cheap Mexican labor and have drawn millions to the border, overwhelming municipal infrastructures. About 90 percent of the 1,400 maquiladoras in operation are situated on the U.S.-Mexico border, with 500 plants along the <LOCATION> Texas-Mexico </LOCATION> border. <PERSON> Juarez </PERSON> alone has 249, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` Some of these maquila plants throw their wastes directly into the sewage disposal system,'' <ORGANIZATION> PAHO </ORGANIZATION> reported in a recent newsletter. `` Other maquilas sell tanks with toxic residues to questionable recycling companies. `` It has been found that these companies dispel these toxic tanks into the first dumping site found. The tank ends up sold to a third party who may use it to store water for their personal hygiene, and @ or to cook or drink.'' Meanwhile, Mrs. <PERSON> Guillen </PERSON> hopes to have running water by December. That's what she's been told.

<HEAD>Industrial Crops May Yield Homegrown Rubber, Newsprint and Lubricants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists believe a new generation of crops with strange names like guayule, kenaf and jojoba may provide homegrown rubber for tires, newsprint for daily papers and lubricants for machines. They also could provide thinners for paint, thickeners for ketchup, moisturizers for cosmetics _ and income for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers. `` This is the beginning of a whole new revolution in agriculture,'' said <PERSON> Himayat </PERSON> <PERSON> Naqvi </PERSON>, president of the Association for the Advancement of Industrial Crops. `` It will give farmers something different to grow, it will help our trade balance, reduce our dependence on foreign oil and improve our environment.'' Scientists, farmers and government officials met in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> earlier this month to discuss crops like <LOCATION> vernonia </LOCATION>, cuphea and lesquerella. Chemicals from such plants can be refined to replace compounds derived from imported oil or from plants raised only in other nations. However, there are few acres of these industrial crops in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the government spends relatively little to develop them, said <PERSON> Naqvi </PERSON>, a plant breeder at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>. The association _ the <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> meeting was its first _ hopes <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will appropriate funds for research so farmers will `` feel safe growing'' the crops. For example, rubber can be extracted from the wild-growing, southwestern shrub guayule and its quality is as good as the best foreign rubber. A pilot processing plant will be built in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Naqvi </PERSON>, but improvements must be made in guayule yields for commercial production to be economical. Another promising crop is jojoba, a desert-grown perennial that produces large brown beans containing a unique oil. It already is used by the cosmetics industry, but could be an excellent lubricant because it withstands temperature and friction. But researchers need to develop better ways to grow and harvest it and control pests, said <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Hyder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jojoba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, which has 1,300 acres of jojoba in a remote desert area of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. `` Jojoba is a high value crop that can be grown on marginal land with far less water than crops like citrus and cotton,'' she said. `` It would be ideal for a state like <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> where water is a prized commodity.'' Commercialization for some industrial crops could be 10 to 20 years away, but <PERSON> Naqvi </PERSON> said the first big success story likely will be kenaf. These tall, fibrous, annuals could be a raw material source for paper and cardboard. The nation's first kenaf milling plant is expected to open in 1991 in <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, to supply newsprint to the newspaper industry. The new crops will provide alternatives for farmers who have gotten into serious economic trouble by producing surpluses of low-value feed grains, <PERSON> Naqvi </PERSON> said. `` If one crop is not working, we should look for something new. It's not enough just to feel sorry for our farmers who are not making any money.'' `` We're a big wheat state and wheat has put a lot of farmers out of business,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, who thought kenaf could fit into the state's diverse agriculture. `` We do n't want to wait 20 or 30 years. We need a product that will convince farmers and investors that these things are going to happen.'' <ORGANIZATION> Grupo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ultra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chem </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is introducing guar, a plant that yields a gum with a wide range of uses that include thickening ketchup. Oil from another, <LOCATION> vernonia </LOCATION>, might be used as a paint thinner _ without unpleasant fumes. `` Environmentally, this is right,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffee </PERSON>, research and development manager for <ORGANIZATION> Grupo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ultra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chem </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're looking for a new, natural approach to chemical production.''

<TEXT>
 Forty years after nuclear wastes were first dumped into the soil of the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation, the government is starting to look at just what's brewing under the surface. The ambitious new Molecular Science Research Centeris a symbol of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s committment to cleaning up after production of nuclear weapons at 17 plants around the country, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Knotek </PERSON>, who left the <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> to become the center's manager. The total cost of the cleanup has been estimated at $ 90 billion to $ 150 billion. `` The country ca n't afford that,'' said <PERSON> Knotek </PERSON>, noting that one major mission will be to find technology to reduce those costs. `` We've got to find a permanent solution. One we can afford and everybody will be happy with.'' When it is completed, it will be the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facility dedicated to molecular science research, the study of molecules and how they combine to form structures. Such work is currently distributed across the country, and the only comparable facility is in <LOCATION> Okazaki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Knotek </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> MSRC </ORGANIZATION> takes molecular research out of a closed setting like a university and into the front line, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Colson </PERSON>, who was hired from <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to be an associate director. `` We're here on top of a major environmental problem You do n't find that at a university.'' The center is expected to focus on problems of cleaning up the Hanford site. Since 1943, <PERSON> Hanford </PERSON> has produced much of the plutonium for the nation's nuclear arsenal; it's the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s most polluted site with more than half of the nation's defense wastes Much of that waste in the past was dumped directly into the soil. What it has been doing underground is not known, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON>, who is using lasers to study the reactions of chemicals that exist underground. Wastes that could be relatively benign alone can combine with others, or with elements in the soil, to become very dangerous; on the other hand, the danger from some wastes could be reduced by molecular conversion occurring underground. The laser research is designed to give a sort of underground weather map of the Hanford site, he said. It will help scientists predict how the wastes are changing, in which direction they are traveling, and how fast. <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> is one of about 10 researchers and staff already working at the center, which is operating on a $ 6 million 1990 budget and has headquarters at the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> run by <PERSON> Battelle </PERSON>. When a $ 135 million building is completed by the mid-1990s, it will have 200 full-time staffers, plus 30 to 50 visiting scientists, and an annual budget of $ 40 million. That is a drop in the bucket compared to the $ 385 million annual budget and 6,300 jobs tied to the production of plutonium for weapons at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> in recent years. Plutonium production has already been sharply curtailed and is expected to be phased out completely by the mid-1990s. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state politicians, especially those opposed to nuclear production at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>, have repeatedly argued that waste cleanup represents the best economic future for the site and the adjacent Tri-Cities. The <ORGANIZATION> MSRC </ORGANIZATION> and a companion <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Excellence </ORGANIZATION>, which will field-test different clean-up proposals, are the cornerstone of a plan to turn Hanford into the nation's leading nuclear cleanup research center. But it is extremely unlikely the waste research can ever provide the level of jobs that defense production did, <PERSON> Knotek </PERSON> said. Hanford is a good choice for the <ORGANIZATION> MSRC </ORGANIZATION> because it is next to the bulk of the nation's defense wastes where `` we will never be able to forget it,'' and because of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s strong environmental interest, he said. Knotek considers environmental cleanup a more pressing goal than the space race set off in the 1950s by the Soviet Sputnik launch. Sputnik was an implied threat to national security, while nuclear waste is a real physical problem. That should lead to an increase in federal funding for environmental science research, with a corresponding increase in jobs for researchers, he said. `` Research follows needs. It's as simple as that.''

Whooping cranes are an endangered species `` The service has been concerned about having all of their eggs in one basket, literally,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Trauger </PERSON>, the center's deputy director. `` The service felt it was the prudent thing to do, to separate the breeding flocks, and there's enough breeders now to do that.'' The center started in 1987 to breed the birds, known for their elaborate courtship dance, under a joint program with Canadian wildlife officials. The foundation was selected as the home of the new flock after considering several groups around the nation. Although it has not bred whooping cranes, it has successfully bred 13 of the 14 other crane species. Scientists hope that by successfully breeding whooping cranes in captivity, they will be able to establish another flock in the wild. An attempt to do that failed in 1975 when a flock at the <ORGANIZATION> Grays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> failed to produce enough eggs to sustain the colony.

<HEAD>Imported Ticks Can Pose Threat to Florida Herds</HEAD>

 An African tick brought to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> by accident poses a threat to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s cattle, sheep, goat and white-tailed deer, say state veterinary scientists who are trying to develop a vaccine. The ticks can cause a skin condition or heartwater disease that can kill up to 90 percent of infected animals, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> scientists say. `` If the disease spreads to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, we probably would have to quarantine the whole state. That would be devastating,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Childs </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattlemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Bont ticks, which infest exotic animals such as rhinoceroses and ostriches. A shipment of rhinoceroses arriving in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> five years ago carried them, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> issued a warning in June after African ticks were found on shipments of imported ostriches sent to several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities. If nothing is done to control the tick in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, it's only a matter of time before birds or imported animals carry it to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Burridge </PERSON>, head of the university's <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tropical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and its Department of Infectious Diseases The ticks can carry a rickettsial bacteria that causes heartwater disease, which is no threat to humans but causes high fever and nervous system disorders in animals. Animals often suffer swelling of the lungs, called pulmonary edema, and hydropericardium, or water around the heart. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is one of the top 10 cattle-producing states, said <PERSON> Childs </PERSON>. A team in Zimbabwean has produced a laboratory technique to grow large quantities of the rickettsial bacteria in culture, but diagnostic field tests are thought to be some three years away, <PERSON> Burridge </PERSON> said. And a heartwater vaccine would not protect animals from the associated fatal skin ailment, acute bovine dermatophilosis, which causes sections of the animal's hide to slough off. Although rare, the skin disease can affect humans. `` It's a horrible disease and we found ... that, for some reason, it occurs only in the areas where there are tropical bont ticks,'' <PERSON> Burridge </PERSON> said. `` If these ticks should spread to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, we're in big trouble because the organism that causes the skin disease is in the soil here already, just waiting for this tick to arrive,'' he said.

 In times of famine, a watery broth with a few vegetables held off death. In mansion dining rooms, a perfectly clear consomme shows the epitome of elegance. For centuries, people have counted on soup. `` People like soup because it not only tastes good but they feel that they are doing something good for themselves,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, author of the cookbook `` Soup Meals.'' `` It gives you all the feelings of security that we seem to need more as time goes by.'' Although soups are made year-round, harvests seem to bring them more to mind. The vegetables available enable the home cook to try all sorts of combinations. `` Cabbage and broccoli are very strong. You have to be careful when you use them with other things. They combine well with potatoes, but they can overwhelm other things,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. `` You can otherwise combine anything that suits your fancy.'' Soups have several advantages. In most kitchens, an inventive cook can find ingredients for a serviceable soup. Soup can be made ahead. And most soups can be frozen. If using canned stock, taste the soup before adding salt. The flavor of canned stock can be substantially improved by letting it simmer for a half hour or so with chopped carrots, onions and celery before it is used. For cream soups, pureed vegetables or rice can substitute for cream. Here are some recipes from <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s `` Soup Meals'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Clarkson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Potter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 1989, $ 19.95 -RRB-:

 The recent stock market turmoil has provided a grim backdrop for the second anniversary today of Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones average plunged a record 508 points. After the Friday-the-13th selloff last week that drove the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> down 190 points, it looked as if stocks were heading for something similar to the crash of two years ago. But the market has settled down this week, gradually allaying those fears. In Wednesday's trading, the Dow Jones average of 30 big industrial stocks rose 4.92 to 2,643.65, bringing its net gain over the past three days to 74.39 points. However, if that steady showing came as a relief, it did not necessarily provide much reassurance for anyone who follows the ups and downs of stock prices. Indeed, the image of Wall Street as a sort of upscale gambling den once again has been reinforced in many minds by the latest gyrations. To individual investors, who have been withdrawing more money than they put into direct stock holdings for two decades now, stocks are widely seen as `` too risky'' and `` too volatile.'' While nobody disputes that risk and volatility are facts of life in stock investing, long-time students of the markets say those two perils are often viewed in a distorted light. Volatility _ the tendency of stock prices to rise and fall dramatically in short periods of time _ has drawn more and more attention in recent years with advances in technology and the concentration of large amounts of capital in the hands of professional traders and money managers. With instant communications and computers programmed to execute buy and sell orders, the market now can react within moments to changing news developments that might once have taken weeks to absorb. But the importance of short-term changes in stock prices diminishes drastically if one examines what has happened in the market in the post-World War II era. Since the late 1970s, stocks have suffered four separate `` October massacres.'' Yet this month also brings another, happier anniversary, notes <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fosback </PERSON>, editor of the investment advisory letter Market Logic. `` Fifteen years ago, amidst the turmoil of Watergate disclosures and the gloom of a deep recession, the current bull market was born,'' he states. From its low of 577.60 in late 1974 through its recent highs near 2,800, the Dow Jones industrial average nearly quintupled, and other, broader measures of stock price trends recorded even greater gains. Results like these were achieved during a time of economic growth, erratic though it may have been from year to year. They by no means preclude the possibility of a long-term decline in stock prices should the economy languish for an extended period. But they do buttress the case that the impact of short-term volatility can be substantially cushioned by the passage of time. When people set about choosing individual stocks to buy, they face a second hazard sometimes referred to as `` company risk.'' That is familiar to people, for example, who might have bought shares of a respected blue chip like <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Steel for an effective price of $ 68 in the 1960s, and seen the stock wither to about half that value today under its present name, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Even before yu factor in inflation, that's a lot of damage for a small investor to suffer. The standard strategy for dealing with company risk is to diversify _ spreading investment money over stocks of several companies in dissimilar businesses, or buying shares of two or three mutual funds. That way, a single big loser poses a much smaller risk of wiping you out.

The administration and the Mexican state oil company, <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>, agreed that an existing supply contract expiring Nov. 30 will not be renewed, said an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source who spoke on condition he not be identified. Additional Mexican oil will be purchased for three months beyond the contract's expiration in order to satisfy a minimum volume requirement, the source said Wednesday. The arrangement is to be announced next month, according to an internal <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> memorandum made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Starting in December, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will meet its stockpile needs by soliciting bids for short-term supply deals with domestic and foreign suppliers _ the usual practice before the Mexican contracts started in 1981. In August 1982, at the height of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s foreign debt crisis, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration agreed to pay <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> $ 1 billion in advance for oil to be put in the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. The decision to end contract purchases from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is due in part to a growing constraint on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s capability to produce enough high-quality Isthmus crude to meet both export and domestic demand, the source said. The reserve was started in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo and is designed to give the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> enough emergency supplies to weather any future disruption of oil imports. The oil, about 575 million barrels, is stored in underground salt domes in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. Nearly half has come from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and only 6 percent from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wells. On Tuesday the department gave <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> an interim report that suggested ways to cut costs of filling the reserve, including leasing oil from foreign producers and selling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government bonds to finance the reserve. An <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> delegation is to fly to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> early next month to discuss the leasing idea and other topics with <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, a department source said.

 Early indications were that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s strong economy would shake off the effects of the devastating earthquake in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said damage in his city and county alone might reach $ 2 billion. But in a sign of investor confidence in the state, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> municipal bond issues were down only slightly Wednesday and in line with the overall decline in the market, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Haslinger </PERSON>, a senior vice president with the investment house <ORGANIZATION> Clayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which evaluates the safety of bond issues and other financial instruments, said it expected the credit impact to be localized. And it said it did not expect to adjust its ratings of the financial obligations of major <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> financial institutions. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, the undersecretary of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and Housing, said Wednesday he stayed up all night assessing the situation, but that it was still too early to set a damage figure. However, he said, `` Overall the impact will be one the state will recover from very quickly. `` We have a large, strong economy, and while the personal tragedy for many families is great, the overall economic picture for the Bay Area and the rest of the state is unclouded by this,'' he said. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said he was optimistic about the insurance business. `` We do n't have huge areas of just massive devastation, block after block, fortunately,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. While damage appeared extremely heavy in such cities as <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON> said he tended to agree with <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> that most insurers would have no major problems. Meanwhile Wednesday, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-area </LOCATION> businesses began to return to normal. Most shuttered companies planned to reopen in the next day or two. Many of them continued operations from offices outside the <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. `` As long as you can manufacture, as long as you can ship and as long as sales people around the world are selling, we're OK,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, senior vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which closed its Cupertino complex Wednesday. The complex of about 20 buildings was still without power nearly 24 hours after the quake, but company officials were optimistic they could reopen today or Friday. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> closed one plant with 8,500 employees just south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, but kept open another plant in the city itself, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, communications manager. At <ORGANIZATION> Amdahl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> manufacturer of mainframe computers, the computer system crashed, then was brought back up _ albeit at one-third the usual speed _ in a backup mode late Tuesday night. <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, another big Sunnyvale-based high-tech company, said it called off the overnight shift Tuesday but normal operations resumed with the start of the day shift Wednesday.

<HEAD>Many Homeowners Not Insured; Analysts Say Disaster May Benefit Insurers</HEAD>

 Those who follow the insurance industry see opportunities for investors in the wake of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake. Analysts predicted insurers will be able to reverse three years of declining rates in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> by increasing pressure on state regulators to boost premiums as a result of the earthquake and the estimated $ 4 billion in damage from Hurricane Hugo in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. An increase in insurance rates could translate into greater profitability in the long term, which in turn would boost the value of stocks, the analysts said Wednesday. `` There's a perception that this could turn the cycle ... that this could be enough to firm pricing,'' said <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Insurance companies struggled Wednesday to assess the amount of claims they're likely to pay as a result of the quake. In addition to home damage, the insurance companies are likely to face claims for automobile damage, broken glass, theft and burglary, business interruption due to electrical outages, water damage and, possibly, workers compensation. Some estimated that damages will reach $ 1 billion or more. But industry observers said they do n't expect any company to be seriously hurt by claims arising from the quake. `` We do n't think any company is going to have problems paying claims,'' said <PERSON> Elisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegal </PERSON>, public affairs manager for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based trade group. Easing the burden on insurers is the fact that most homeowners in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area do n't have earthquake insurance on their houses. The <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> said that in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area, 25 to 30 percent of the homes have earthquake insurance. The organization estimated residential damage at $ 500 million in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, with $ 100 million to $ 150 million of that insured. Statewide in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, only 15 to 20 percent of all homeowners have earthquake insurance, which typically requires a 10 percent deductible and costs $ 200 to $ 400 a year for a $ 100,000 home, according to industry spokesmen. Insured homeowners without earthquake protection will have to pay for repairs to their houses themselves, unless their homes are ravaged by fire. Fire damage is covered under basic homeowner insurance polices, said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Strawn </PERSON>, director of catastrophe services at the <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Schaumburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` If there was fire damage, the fire is covered. That's quite specific,'' <PERSON> Strawn </PERSON> said. Earthquake insurance is an emotional and politically-charged issue in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where many of the nation's most damaging earthquakes have occurred. Under a 1985 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law, insurers are required to offer earthquake insurance to homebuyers, but homebuyers are not required to buy the coverage. Insurers are n't required to offer earthquake insurance to commercial property owners, but the percentage of business property with the coverage is higher than that of homeowners, industry spokesmen said. They estimated that at least 25 percent, and probably many more, business properties are insured. Because of its high costs, earthquake insurance has become a target of the controversial Proposition 103 approved by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters last year. The proposition calls for a 20 percent rollback in insurance rates. Insurers and state regulators are battling over the rates and how they're set.

<HEAD>Texas Instruments Unveils First Magazine Ad That Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There've been pop-up ads, scented ads, even a magazine spread that played Christmas music. But this week <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has taken it a step further with a magazine ad that `` talks'' to readers. `` I am the talking chip, one of many <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MegaChip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> that are changing the way the world lives, works and plays,'' says the voice generated by a miniscule computer chip that costs less than $ 2 to produce. `` This ad demonstrates a new tool for creative people to deliver powerful messages in an arresting way,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, who supervised the project for the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> McCann-Erickson </ORGANIZATION> advertising agency. `` Who can ignore a printed page in Business Week that talks to you?'' he said. `` The effect is truly startling.'' The ad will run in 140,000 copies of Business Week's Oct. 20 industrial-technology edition and 76,000 copies of its Nov. 20 international editions. The ad also features a tear-away section, allowing a look at the credit-card-sized, eighth-inch thick gadget that contains three batteries with enough juice for 650 repetitions; a microprocessor that performs 61 chores and generates the voice; and a one-inch speaker. The chip represents the latest advance in speech synthesis semiconductors, said TI's <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON>, product manager for semiconductor speech. `` For years, high-quality speech has been a luxury that manufactures added only to consumer products with price points of $ 50, $ 75, $ 100 or more,'' <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> said. `` Our goal has been to reduce the cost of speech technology to make it practical in more applications.'' TI hopes the advertisement will demonstrate not only marketing possibilities, but spark ideas for other uses of the silicon wafer. Reducing the chip cost to under $ 2 allows products using the technology to sell at retail for about $ 10, <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> said. One possible use for the chip is the creation of talking products for the visually handicapped, which would contain verbal warnings or statements about their use. Magazine advertisers in recent years gone to extraordinary lengths to make their messages stand out. <ORGANIZATION> TransAmerica </ORGANIZATION>, for instance, devised an ad that ran in <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 that featured a pop-up of a facsimile of its distinctive <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> tower. Dodge trucks had a similar pop-up ad for its midsize pickup truck in a 1987 issue of Sports Illustrated. Also in 1987, the importers of Absolut vodka introduced sound to mass-market magazine advertising by including a battery-powered microchip that played Christmas music when its ad in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION> magazine was opened. Absolut's most recent ad features a punch-out paper bottle of its vodka that produces a 3-D image when the reader looks through two eye holes in it. TI began using speech technology in 1974 and in 1978 introduced its popular Speak and Spell line of educational toys. In the meantime, all sorts of products have begun to talk: books, cars, alarm clocks, toys, learning aids and appliances. TI also uses its speech know-how in many of its military projects. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>' ad was developed with <ORGANIZATION> Intervisual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> McCann-Erickson </PERSON>.

<HEAD>AMR Says Trump Offer `Ill-Considered'; Trump Calls AMR `Smug'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has broken its silence imposed since <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> made his since-aborted $ 7.5 billion takeover offer, calling the bid for the parent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> `` ill-considered and reckless.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> billionaire retorted Wednesday that the board's statement was `` strident and pompously self-serving'' and accusing <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> management of `` smugness'' in it attitude toward stockholders After a meeting Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> board issued a statement saying, `` We are pleased that Mr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has withdrawn his uninvited proposal to negotiate a cash merger agreement with AMR. ... AMR has not been, and is not, for sale.'' The statement was the first of substance from the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth-based </LOCATION> company since it received <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s offer Oct. 4. `` AMR has been operating pursuant to a highly successful long-term plan designed to create growth and value,'' the statement said. `` We see absolutely no basis for departing from that strategy and believe that the imposition of a highly leveraged capital structure would have very unfavorable effects.'' The board took no other action stemming from <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s offer, said spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotard </PERSON>. Some industry analysts had speculated the board might erect stronger takeover defenses, such as taking advantage of lower stock prices to create an employee stock ownership plan that would place a big block of shares in presumably friendly hands, making a hostile takeover nearly impossible. `` AMR's reference to its successful long-term plan ... is particularly ironic on a day that <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> reported a significant decline in net income ... and has warned its shareholders of a disappointing fourth quarter to come,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` AMR's smugness about its marketplace perception ought perhaps to give way to a concern for its shareholders,'' he said. `` To date, <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> has yet to pay any dividend.'' AMR stock rose 75 cents to close at $ 74 a share Wednesday in heavy trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> withdrew his bid Monday because of the tumble in <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price during and after the market's Friday the 13th selloff The selloff was sparked by troubles in financing a $ 6.75 billion management-employee buyout of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> stock had hit $ 107 immediately after <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s offer, but fell to the mid - $ 70s in the market plunge <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said he would consider other options, including selling his <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> shares or making a lower offer. However, analysts doubt he can return with a bid below the $ 120 a share he already offered. Financing questions dogged <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s proposal and analysts questioned how he would raise enough money in the unsettled credit markets beyond the $ 1 billion in equity he promised to put up himself. AMR had focused on the debt in its initial, vague response to the flashy tycoon's proposal for the nation's largest airline and Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> repeated that concern Wednesday. `` Imposing extraordinary levels of debt on an airline, particularly without the active cooperation of both management and employees, will not serve the long-term interests of anyone,'' <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> said. `` The public will be disadvantaged if excessive financing reduces an airline's ability to seize new opportunities, to promptly replace old airplanes, to be responsive to environmental desires for quieter airplanes, to produce adequate passenger and freight facilities, to finance state-of-the-art maintenance and pilot training facilities ...,'' <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> said its profit in the three months ended Sept. 30 fell to $ 137 million, or $ 2.16 per share, from $ 150.3 million, or $ 2.50 a share, in the same period last year. Revenue rose to $ 2.73 billion from $ 2.33 billion last year. <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> blamed the results on a slight decrease in yield and a more than 11 percent increase in fuel prices from a year earlier, and said <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> expected those trends to continue in the fourth quarter. `` This unhappy outlook ... underscores the continuing volatility of airline earnings and the importance of an adequate capital base,'' he said. <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> told analysts last month that profits through next year would be squeezed by the gradual recovery of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> from a crippling strike, higher labor costs, expansion of service and purchase of new aircraft. <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> said the airline had 21.6 percent of the domestic market during the quarter. For the first nine months, <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings rose 15.5 percent to $ 415.9 million, or $ 6.59 per share, from $ 360.1 million, or $ 5.99 per share, a year earlier. Revenue in the nine-month period rose to $ 7.89 billion from $ 6.46 billion.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former top federal prosecutor says the crippling fines and forfeiture provisions of the federal racketeering law should be turned on those accused of fraud in the savings and loan scandals. And the man who helped craft the controversial Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act agrees. At a conference discussing the future of RICO, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> diGenova </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, said the law was `` perfect for what went on in the savings and loan industry.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has enacted a $ 50 billion bailout plan for the nation's faltering savings and loans, many of which failed because of fraud, mismanagement and the economic downturn in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> In April, the government seized a large <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> thrift, <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irvine </ORGANIZATION>, and filed a $ 1.1 billion civil lawsuit against its operators, charging fraud and racketeering. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON>, chief economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION>, attributed approximately one in 10 failures to fraud. `` It seems to me that knowing what we know about RICO, and knowing what we know about the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis, that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could not have enacted a better statute to deal with what went on in the savings and loan industry over the last few years,'' said <PERSON> diGenova </PERSON>, now in private practice. That notion was seconded by <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> professor who was one of the architects of the <ORGANIZATION> RICO </ORGANIZATION> statute nearly 20 years ago. `` It's not a single instance of fraud but it would be a pattern of frauds: multiple bad loans of one kind and another, insiders dealing with outsiders. That falls within the core meaning of RICO, mail fraud and wire fraud.'' Their remarks came at a conference, `` RICO, Rights and the Constitution,'' sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Cato </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based think tank. Passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1970 as part of the Organized Crime Control Act, <ORGANIZATION> RICO </ORGANIZATION> was designed to make it easier for prosecutors to go after mobsters by giving them a tool to attack seemingly legitimate businesses associated with organized crime. Prosecutors can take seemingly unrelated crimes or alleged crimes committed by several people over a 10-year-period, and if they can convince a jury that those charged were linked through a `` criminal enterprise,'' they can win a racketeering conviction. Those convicted are subject to maximum penalties of 20 years in prison, hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines and forfeiture of illegal profits into the millions, if the government can collect. In civil RICO cases, brought either by the government or private parties, defendants are liable to pay triple damages if found to have engaged in a `` racketeering enterprise.'' Though tremendously successful in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s attack on the Mafia, RICO has become increasingly controversial as prosecutors used it on crooked politicians and businessmen in cases that critics say might not have been brought under other laws But in reply to that argument, <PERSON> diGenova </PERSON> countered: `` No one seems to have a problem with applying RICO to the <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> -LRB- organized crime -RRB- family or the Genovese -LRB- organized crime -RRB- family or anyone of a number of families whose names end in vowels. The do have a problem, apparently, applying RICO to people whose names do n't end in vowels and run what are called legitimate businesses but who happen to engage in massive fraud.

 A devastating earthquake in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> failed to move the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil futures market despite reports of major pipeline shutdowns. Late Wednesday, inspectors examined gasoline pipelines in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for possible leaks or ruptures while major oil companies made contingency plans to avoid supply disruptions. Officials said the pipelines were closed as a precaution following Tuesday's earthquake. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, fell 19 cents to finish at $ 20.56 cents a barrel after a brief earthquake-related rally at the opening. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for November delivery closed at 54.58 cents a gallon, down 1.26 cents from Tuesday, and November heating oil dipped 0.45 cent to settle at 60.60 cents a gallon. Energy brokers said weekly inventory statistics that showed a 5.7-million-barrel rise in crude oil last week helped weaken the market once earthquake news was absorbed. Pipeline owners in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said hundreds of miles of underground gasoline pipes were closed Tuesday when the quake hit. No damage was detected as of late Wednesday and the pipelines were expected to resume normal operations, they said. `` We know of no line ruptures or seam leaks,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>, senior vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, which has 800 miles of pipeline stretching from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION> `` We will do some low-pressure testing and once we're satisfied that the lines are in good shape, we will start the system back up.'' The pipelines deliver gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, refineries to big terminals. Products are then trucked to service stations. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> both reported minor damage to refineries. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> said the quake jolted <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s 315,000 barrel-a-day <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> facility but the plant resumed normal operations early in the day <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said it slowed operations slightly at its 135,000-barrel-a-day <LOCATION> Benicia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, refinery. Spokesman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Beathard </PERSON> said the company did not know when normal refinery operations would resume. Several companies said they were making contingency plans to ensure delivery of products by truck in case pipelines remained closed. `` Theoretically, we could bring product up from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION> if necessary,'' said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Companies also said they were inspecting underground storage tanks at service stations and establishing alternate delivery routes to avoid damaged roadways <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> terminal sustained minor damage but would not disrupt deliveries. <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said between 12,000 and 15,000 barrels of gasoline leaked from three storage tanks at its <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> terminal but the spill was contained.

Dealers said the dollar was still under pressure following a larger-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit in August and relaxed monetary policy by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> following Friday's stock market slide The price index was expected to rise 0.4 percent after being unchanged in August, dealers said. `` We're seeing a very quiet, technical market this morning,'' said one trader in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. `` Nonetheless, there is still evidence of volatility. We do n't have a determined trend.'' A dealer at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said: `` The dollar has been strongly offered in recent days, so we are actually surprised that it is n't even lower. ... The market is waiting for another piece of bad news, and then it will go down quickly.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.55 yen to a closing 141.55 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted lower, at 141.25 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's prices, included: 1.84495 West German marks, down from 1.8525; 1.6193 Swiss francs, down from 1.6255; 6.26725 French francs, down from 6.2990; 2.08425 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0818; 1,359.50 Italian lire, down from 1,366.00; 1.17325 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1737 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $ 1.60075 to buy one pound, more expensive than $ 1.5880 late Wednesday. Bullion dealers said trading was quiet as gold showed a subdued reaction to the weaker dollar. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 368.40 a troy ounce, up from late Wednesday's $ 368.25. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 368.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 368.75, up from late Wednesday's $ 368.50 Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose 51 cents to close at a bid $ 368.89. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 5.12 a troy ounce, up from late Wednesday's $ 5.11.

 Stock prices rose for the third consecutive session today, continuing their comeback from Monday's plunge. Meanwhile, the dollar declined against the Japanese yen. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency closed at 141.55 yen, down 0.55 yen from Wednesday's 142.10 yen-close It opened at 140.97 yen and moved between 140.80 yen and 141.70 yen. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues gained 266.66 points, or 0.76 percent, closing at 35,374.22. It had gained 111.48 points Wednesday and 527.39 on Tuesday. `` The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market has completely recovered from its large drop Monday,'' said <PERSON> Shunichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishimura </PERSON>, a senior dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. The index fell 647.33 points on Monday, this year's largest one-day loss, following the big tumble in prices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Friday, when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell 190 points. The Nikkei index has shot up a total of 905.53 points since Monday.

Trading was fairly active, with first section volume estimated at 800 million shares, the same as Wednesday. Steel, construction and railway issues were among the gainers. In currency dealings, the dollar opened sharply lower following selling on overseas markets, said <PERSON> Yuji </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakao </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. After that, he said, market participants could not decide the dollar's direction. `` The dollar has become less attractive to investors,'' he said, citing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic developments including a wider trade deficit, Friday's stock price plunge and lower interest rates.

 Stock prices advanced in modest trading Thursday, boosted largely by technical factors linked to a squeeze among investors shopping for blue chip stocks. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was up 16.1 points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,186.2 at midday. Dealers said the market had not reacted substantially to a flurry of British economic indicators released just before midday. Some expressed disappointment over September's record bank loans of 10.2 billion pounds, or $ 16.3 billion, saying this could be a factor in pressuring <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to maintain high interest rates. The market was expected to continue firm at least ahead of Wall Street's opening. But dealers cautioned that the thin and largely directionless market would take its cue from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> once it opens. Volume was 222 million shares, a modest turnover in comparison to previous sessions this week.

 <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price appears to have stabilized, but dealmakers trying to salvage a proposed buyout of the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> may have trouble courting one prospective investor, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>' chief financial officer, said his company was `` in no way committed to a deal going through at all.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, also said his company might reduce its planned equity investment of $ 750 million if a new <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> buyout deal is put together. A buyout offer of $ 230 a share would be `` certainly not too low,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s stock closed at $ 191.75 Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, down a comparatively small $ 6.25 following a two-day drop of $ 81.62 at the beginning of the week. `` The worst of the sell-off appears to be over at this point,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON>, an airline industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, who predicted speculators would watch the market until concrete terms of a new bid are announced. <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday they were continuing to court Japanese lenders, who balked at the original deal, with a sweeter offer. A <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> has said the new offer was worth $ 250 a share, or $ 5.62 billion The group trying acquire the nation's second-largest air carrier said Friday it could not get banks to finance its $ 6.75 billion, $ 300-a-share offer. That announcement from the group _ made up of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilots, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> management and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> _ helped spark a stock market plunge and the biggest one-day decline in the Dow Jones industrial average since the crash of 1987. The widely-followed index tumbled 190 points Friday. A <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lampl </PERSON>, said he could not comment on how long it would take to reconstruct a revised formal proposal. Spokesmen for the pilots union could not be reached Wednesday. Billionaire investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he remained interested in acquiring <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, but not at the $ 300-a-share level he previously offered. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> started the buyout fight for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> when he submitted a bid in August. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, which represents nearly 25,000 of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s 70,000 workers, vehemently opposed the pilot-management group's original bid. It contended the plan would put the airline into too much debt, and that the 10 percent steady revenue-growth projections on which the deal was based were unrealistic. On Tuesday, the Machinists called for the resignation of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> and asked for a federal investigation into possible violations of securities laws by <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` It's very, very important, especially from the Japanese viewpoint, that there is some semblance of labor harmony,'' <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> said of the Machinist actions. But even with the Machinists' continued opposition, Japanese backers could agree to finance a less risky bid of under $ 250 a share, he said. Machinists spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Conley </PERSON> said the union was not looking for credit for quashing the original proposal, but was happy to accept it. `` Had we gone along with it I think it probably would have flown, but that would have been irresponsible on our part,'' <PERSON> Conley </PERSON> said. `` It was really an issue of job security,'' he said. `` When the deal starts going sour, they do n't go back to the banks to renegotiate the financing. The first thing they do is lop heads.''

 The stock market staged a broad advance today, extending its recovery from the `` Friday the 13th massacre'' with encouragement from better-than-expected inflation news. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 16.39 to 2,660.04 in the first half hour of trading. Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 3 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 802 up, 237 down and 407 unchanged.

After taking a 190.58-point tumble last Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrials recovered 73.39 points over this week's first three sessions. The average got an added lift today when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the consumer price index rose just 0.2 percent in September. The increase was about half of what had been expected, given a marked upswing in the producer price index of finished goods reported last week for September.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders, as expected, today approved a major, defensive restructuring planned by the British conglomerate, including the sale of all its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailing operations. BAT's plan is aimed at increasing shareholder value in an attempt to thwart a hostile, all-paper $ 21 billion bid from an investor group led by Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>. The purchase would be the world's second largest takeover behind the $ 25 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> completed earlier this year. BAT is the world's biggest tobacco company and has substantial operations in retailing _ such as the <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> chains in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ paper and financial services. BAT's shareholders cast their vote at a special shareholders meeting held in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. BAT Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said more than 99 percent of the votes favored the plan. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> previously said his bidding group <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> would vote in favor of the BAT plan, calling it `` a first step'' in the `` unbundling'' of the conglomerate which he has proposed. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, who wants to sell off all of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s non-tobacco interests, has said he intends to pursue a takeover of BAT. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION>'s offer of $ 13.96 worth of securities for each BAT share has been suspended while the bidders seek approval from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> state insurance commissioners to change the ownership of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. That could take months. Hoylake held between 2 percent and 3 percent of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s shares at the last announced count. BAT's shares were up the equivalent of 52 cents at $ 12.55 on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after the voting results were announced. The stock has been seesawing during the recent stock market turmoil and on concerns about what effect Wednesday's disastrous <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake might have on Farmers. Company spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Prideaux </PERSON> said Wednesday that the stock market's recent gyrations would not change BAT's restructuring plans, which he characterized as long-term. BAT intends to sell off its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailing interests and divest its paper companies and British retailing interests to existing BAT shareholders. It plans to retain its tobacco and financial services businesses. BAT also intends to buy back 10 percent of its stock and boost its dividend by 50 percent. These moves are intended to enhance BAT's share value. The company's critics have complained that BAT's share price has been depressed by the relative slow growth of its tobacco interests.

While <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T is not aiming to eliminate a specified number of jobs, spokesman <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said, `` It would not be unreasonable for 5,000 to 15,000 managers to take advantage of the plan.'' <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T will double to 34,000 the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments. It also offered a special sweetened pension plan for managers who choose to retire on Dec. 30. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T embarked on an aggressive cost-cutting program beginning in 1984, the year it lost its local operating companies in the breakup of the Bell System. Since then the company has cut its payroll from 373,000 to 298,000. This is the first program aimed only at managers. The largest single job cut in the company's history came in late 1986, when <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T eliminated 32,000 jobs. The company has relied on incentives when slashing employment, but <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> noted that this is the first `` pension sweetener'' in <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T history. `` We are in a topsy-turvy marketplace, and we need to have as many people at the elbows of our customers as possible and as few people in non-sales, behind-the-scenes jobs as possible,'' <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said. The retirement option will increase expenses in the fourth quarter, but the amount can not be determined until the number of participants is determined.

 The nation's stock markets have shrugged off the deadly <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake and traders even found it created buying opportunities in certain stocks. Construction contractors and computer disaster-recovery services were among the companies that saw their stock prices jacked up Wednesday by investors in search of quake-related profits. Even some insurance stocks rose after analysts said the quake could stimulate insurers to raise rates and improve the industry's profitability By today the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> quake was mostly forgotten on Wall Street as stocks rallied in response to a fresh piece of news: an unexpected slowdown of inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today that consumer prices rose a modest 0.2 percent in September. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 23.56 points at 2,667.21 at 11 a.m. EDT as advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a 3-to-1 margin on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. On Wednesday, the first session after the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> quake, the Dow Jones average ended the day up 4.92 to 2,643.65 in the calmest trading since last Friday's 190-point plunge. The only quake-related jitters came in the opening moments. Most companies with headquarters in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and the nearby <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> were unscathed by the market. Even the phone and utility companies suffered only small declines on Wall Street, as analysts concluded damage to them was less than feared. The Diablo Canyon nuclear power plants of <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> were reported to be unharmed. One big gainer from the quake was <ORGANIZATION> Kasler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a road and bridge builder based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, whose stock rose almost 30 percent. `` Obviously one has to assume that the amount of construction work that's going to be necessary out there is enormous. <ORGANIZATION> Kasler </ORGANIZATION> is one of those that should see a good increase in business,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He added, `` I hate to use the word ` good' in such a tragedy.'' The earthquake cut power to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where some traders continued to work by candlelight, but trading in stock options had to be suspended. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> late Wednesday approved a plan to shift trading in those options temporarily to exchanges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The biggest declines from the quake actually came overseas on the Australian and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> markets, which close before <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> opens for business. Traders there sold partly out of fear that the quake might sink the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stock markets. The bigger foreign markets reacted more calmly. Key indexes gained about 0.3 percent in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and 1.6 percent in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where trading overlaps with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading day.

<TEXT>
 Consumer prices in September rose an unexpectedly modest 0.2 percent, with most prices virtually unchanged except for a sharp rise in clothing costs, the government said today. Energy prices, which had climbed sharply at the wholesale level, raising the expectation of an increase on the retail level, fell for the fourth consecutive month in September, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Jittery stock and bond markets rallied on the news, taking the favorable inflation number as a sign the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has leeway to nudge interest rates lower. At noon EDT, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average was up 31.35 points to 2,675.00. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, chief economic adviser to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, called the data `` good economic news.'' He added: `` We're delighted to be able to say that, while we're always on guard to make sure that inflation remains under control, the concern earlier in the year that inflation was getting out of control appears to have been unfounded.'' Also, the report triggered an announcement that the nation's 38.9 million Social Security recipients will get a 4.7 percent benefit increase in January to offset the effects of inflation over the past year The cost-of-living increase is determined by comparing the Consumer Price Index in the July-September quarter with the same period of last year. The average recipient will see his or her benefits increased by $ 25 a month to $ 566. At the same time, the cap on Social Security payroll taxes will rise. Workers will have to pay the tax on their first $ 50,400 in wages, up from $ 48,000. Meanwhile, in a separate report, the department said Americans' average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, rose 0.3 percent in September following a 0.7 percent decline in August Average weekly earnings in September were $ 338.67, up 3.5 percent from a year earlier. But, when inflation is taken into account, real weekly earnings were down. Consumer prices rose at a high annual rate of 6.7 percent for the first five months of the year, driven up by rising gasoline prices. However, the index has risen only 0.2 percent or remained flat in each of the last four months, bringing the annual rate down to 4.4 percent for the first three quarters, the same as the rate for all of 1988 and 1987. `` This shows clearly that inflation is under control. ... Under these circumstances, there is no question that interest rates will fall,'' said economist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacReynolds </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. But, economist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said the September report overstates the decline in inflation and warned of higher energy prices ahead. `` There has been an abatment, but it has n't been to the degree this number would suggest. We're likely to have some less attractive numbers in the fourth quarter,'' he said. Gasoline prices, down 2.2 percent in September, have declined 9.3 percent in the past four months after increasing 21.2 percent in the first five months of the year. Fuel oil prices fell 0.2 percent last month after declining 0.9 percent in August. However, analysts do n't expect the trend to persist because crude oil prices have been rising. Food prices, which were surging earlier in the year, rose a moderate 0.2 percent last month, in part because of a 1.1 percent decline for fruits and vegetables. Food and beverage prices, which shot up at a 9.3 percent annual rate through May, from June to September climbed at only a 1.7 percent rate. Also down last month were coffee, 2.7 percent, and fats and oils and non-alcoholic beverages. However, the index for dairy products jumped 1.4 percent, the largest monthly increase since May 1980. Clothing prices, after falling in the three previous months, rose 1.7 percent in September. Apparel for women and girls, reflecting the introduction of new fall and winter fashions, were up 3.6 percent. The various changes left the overall Consumer Price Index at 125.0 in September, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods and services costing $ 100 in the 1982-84 base period would have cost $ 125 last month. The Social Security benefit increase is based on a narrower index that reflects costs for urban wage earners and clerical workers. That index was 123.6. In advance of the report, most economists were expecting an inflation figure approximately double the 0.2 percent reported in September. The more modest rise may provide room for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to reduce interest rates. The central bank has been fighting inflation by trying to slow the economy with higher interest rates. In response to the stock market gyrations, the central bank this week has allowed the interest rate for overnight loans between banks to decline about one-quarter percentage point to 8.75 percent. With today's inflation number, most analysts now believe the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will allow the rate to fall further, or at least refrain from pushing it back up once market turmoil has subsided. In another report emphasizing the economy's softness, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said new state unemployment claims for the week ending Oct. 7 increased 62,000 from the previous week to 396,000.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday announced a 19 percent gain in third-quarter earnings and announced incentives that could lead 5,000 to 15,000 managers to take early retirement. Meanwhile, Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 6.5 percent quarterly profit increase and <ORGANIZATION> Denver-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its profit fell 8.9 percent. While <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> said it is not aiming to eliminate a specified number of jobs, spokesman <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said, `` It would not be unreasonable for 5,000 to 15,000 managers to take advantage of the plan.'' Analysts praised <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's cost-cutting step, saying the company has too many managers in light of its sluggish sales of computers and network equipment. `` They're doing exactly what I think they need to do,'' said <PERSON> Lap </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> analyst. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T will double to 34,000 the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments. It is also offering a special sweetened pension plan for managers who choose to retire on Dec. 30. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T embarked on an aggressive cost-cutting program beginning in 1984, the year it lost its local operating companies in the breakup of the Bell System. Since then the company has cut its payroll from 373,000 to 298,000. This is the first program aimed only at managers. The largest single job cut in the company's history came in late 1986, when <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T eliminated 32,000 jobs. The company has relied on incentives when slashing employment, but <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> noted that this is the first `` pension sweetener'' in <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T history. `` We are in a topsy-turvy marketplace, and we need to have as many people at the elbows of our customers as possible and as few people in non-sales, behind-the-scenes jobs as possible,'' <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said. The retirement option will increase expenses in the fourth quarter, but the amount can not be determined until the number of participants is determined. The company said the higher expenses would be offset by other items, including a gain from a share exchange that ends its direct investment in Ing. <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. SpA <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T reported profits rose 19 percent to $ 699 million, or 65 cents a share in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $ 587 million, or 55 cents a share a year ago. Revenue increased 1 percent to $ 8.9 billion from $ 8.81 billion in the third quarter a year ago. For the nine-month period, profit totaled $ 1.99 billion, or $ 1.85 a share, up 19 percent from $ 1.67 billion, or $ 1.56 a share, a year ago. Revenue increased 3 percent to $ 26.81 billion, from $ 26.00 billion in the year-ago period. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said that while the company is pleased with the results, `` we are keenly aware that we face stiff competition in all our markets.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T will `` continue to be aggressive in the marketing of our products and services, and aggressive as well in continuing to drive costs out of every part of our business.'' <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, two of the companies carved out of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T in the 1984 breakup, reported differing results. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> attributed its gains partly to strong growth in telephone usage, while <ORGANIZATION> U </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> said its profit dip was the result of special factors that masked `` modest earnings growth.'' <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> said its profit rose to $ 363.2 million, or $ 1.82 a share, from $ 341 million, or $ 1.02 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $ 2.91 billion from $ 2.76 billion. For the first nine months, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> said profit rose to $ 1.07 billion, or $ 5.43 a share, from $ 1.01 billion, or $ 5.12 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $ 8.56 billion from $ 7.69 billion. <ORGANIZATION> U </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> said profit fell to $ 258.1 million, or $ 1.39 a share, from $ 283.2 million, or $ 1.55 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to $ 2.32 billion from $ 2.43 billion. `` Nevertheless, we're not satisfied with these results. The major negative factor is the cumulative impact of regulatory activity over the past two years on our telephone operations,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON>, U S West's chairman and chief executive. For the year to date, <ORGANIZATION> U </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> said earnings fell to $ 766.3 million, or $ 4.17 a share, from $ 860 million, or $ 4.68 a share, a year earlier.

 Toy company <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday said better profit margins and improved performances by its <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Playskool </ORGANIZATION> units helped third-quarter earnings rise 73 percent. The company reported earnings of $ 31.3 million, or 53 cents per share, compared with $ 18.08 million, or 31 cents a share, in 1988's third quarter Revenue rose 9.4 percent to $ 403 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $ 368.4 million a year earlier. `` As anticipated, our third quarter gross profit margin improved from that of the second quarter,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive. Along with better revenue by <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Playskool </ORGANIZATION>, which concentrates on toys for infants and young children, international operations showed improvement, despite being hurt by a strong dollar, <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON> said. Analysts had said the <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> unit's board games could take a beating from video games. <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> recently bought many of the products formerly manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, including Cabbage Patch dolls, Scrabble and Parcheesi.

<HEAD>Caterpillar Earnings Plunge 43 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s third-quarter earnings tumbled 43 percent because of a sales slump that has forced the company to place about 325 employees on indefinite layoff, the firm said Thursday. Plants in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mossville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mapleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> would be affected, but <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>, a major manufacturer of earth-moving equipment, did not announce how many workers at each plant would be idled. Caterpillar also said a plant in <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> would shut down operations involving about 175 workers for a total of four weeks in November and December. The layoffs are necessary `` to keep production in line with demand,'' the company said in a statement. The York plant employs 2,200 people, while in the area of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> affected by layoffs, there are 10,500 production workers, said company spokesman R.E. <PERSON> Stober </PERSON>. Caterpillar blamed its sales decline in part on higher interest rates, which led to reduced construction activity and discouraged purchases of replacement equipment, particularly in the housing sector. <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 108 million, or $ 1.07 per share, for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared to $ 190 million, or $ 1.87 per share, for the same period a year ago. Revenue fell 5 percent to $ 2.64 billion from $ 2.79 billion as equipment sales declined 6 percent to $ 2.58 billion from $ 2.74 billion. The company said its earnings also reflected an $ 11 million provision for bad debts on Latin American receivables. For the first nine months, <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 390 million, or $ 3.85 per share, down 14 percent from $ 453 million, or $ 4.46 per share, a year ago. Revenue for the first three quarters rose 8 percent to $ 8.36 billion from $ 7.77 billion.

 <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its third-quarter profit nearly doubled because of a large gain on the restructuring of its energy operations. Grace, whose main business is specialty chemicals but which also has interests in manufacturing and health care services, said it earned $ 97.9 million, or $ 1.15 a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, up 93.7 percent from $ 50.5 million, or 60 cents a share, a year earlier. Third-quarter revenue rose 7 percent to $ 1.49 billion from $ 1.39 billion a year earlier. The latest results included a pretax gain of $ 114.4 million resulting from the energy operations restructuring. That included the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an initial public offering in <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and an adjustment in the carrying value of natural resource assts. The latest results were also depressed by higher interest expenses and an accrual for stock appreciation rights. In its specialty chemicals business, <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> said reported operating income after taxes of $ 59 million for the quarter, slightly ahead of 1988 results. Operating income for the quarter rose 22 percent to $ 9.2 million in natural resoruces, fell 14 percent to $ 7.6 million in health care and dropped 29.6 percent in specialty businesses to $ 8.8 million due to absence of a $ 4.6 million gain a year earlier. For the first nine months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 171.4 million, or $ 2.01 a share, up 8.4 percent from $ 158.1 million, or $ 1.87 a share, a year earlier.

<HEAD>Shareholders Vote For BAT Restructuring</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> shareholders overwhelmingly approved a major restructuring Thursday that includes the sale of the conglomerate's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailing businesses and is aimed at thwarting a $ 21 billion hostile takeover. Among shares voting for the restructuring, in which BAT hopes to bolster its stock value by concentrating on its tobacco and financial interests, were those controlled by the takeover group led by Anglo-French financier Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>. BAT also plans to buy back up to 10 percent of its outstanding stock, or 153 million shares. Shortly after the midday vote at a special shareholders meeting announced it had bought 2.5 million shares at the equivalent of $ 12.48 a share from the brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wedd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. BAT's shares rose the equivalent of 43 cents to $ 12.52 a share Thursday on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The Goldsmith group, <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, and its associates controlled between 2 percent and 3 percent of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s shares at the last announced count A spokesman for <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, who was not identified, said by telephone, `` We voted for it, as we said we would.'' The restructuring was favored by 99 percent of the shareholder votes cast, said BAT Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON>. BAT plans to retain its tobacco and financial services businesses and sell its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailing interests, which include <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> and Marshall Field stores. It also plans to spin off its paper companies and British retailing interests to existing BAT shareholders and to boost its dividend by 50 percent. BAT said it would keep acquiring shares under its buyback plan, subject to price, availability and market conditions, up to the close of business on Friday. After then, BAT may not buy more shares until it has released its third-quarter results on Nov. 22. `` We will proceed as speedily as possible and in light of market conditions,'' <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> told shareholders. There was concern that the recent stock market turmoil following the Friday the 13th plunge on Wall Street and the large number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailing properties on the block might make it difficult for BAT to sell pieces at a good price and might delay the restructuring. `` We are determined to get a good price for them,'' <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said. `` We are not in any hurry to sell them.'' <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said BAT already had intended to change its strategy of diversifying slowly away from tobacco, and <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s bid prompted a `` significant acceleration.'' <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> wants to sell off all BAT's non-tobacco interests and says it will continue pursuing its bid despite the restructuring. BAT's critics have complained the relative slow growth of the tobacco businesses has depressed the market value of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s shares. But <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said tobacco offers steady earnings and good cash flow, while financial services offer faster growth. These businesses represent 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s forecast pre-tax profit for 1989. There was no sign of <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> at the shareholders meeting. The Anglo-French financier previously said <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> would vote for the restructuring, calling it a first step in his hoped-for `` unbundling'' of the conglomerate. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION>'s bid of $ 13.96 worth of securities for each BAT share has been suspended while it seeks approval from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> state insurance commissioners to change the ownership of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said he did n't expect Farmers' profit to be hurt by Tuesday's disastrous <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that higher costs in its aerospace and auto products businesses contributed to a 5.5 percent drop in the conglomerate's third-quarter earnings <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 59.5 million, or 66 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with 1988 third-quarter results of $ 62.8 million, or 72 cents per share. Revenue increased to $ 1.73 billion from $ 1.72 billion a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION>'s aerospace business was especially hard hit by cost increases in its fixed-price contracts to develop the V22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has canceled that program, but <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> is attempting to persuade <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to restore funding, he said. Overall aerospace segment revenue fell nearly 10 percent to $ 756 million, and earnings in that division were down almost 17 percent to $ 65.6 million. <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION>'s commercial products segment, which includes its automotive businesses, posted a $ 41 million increase in revenue to $ 434 million but earnings decreased from $ 33 million to $ 27 million. <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> said he was unable to pinpoint one reason for the softer margins in that segment. `` It's just a question of the costs were higher than we thought they would be,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION>'s financial services sector saw earnings increase 25 percent to $ 69 million because of strength in consumer finance and insurance businesses, <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> said. For the first nine months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 182.1 million, or $ 2.17 a share, compared with $ 170.4 million, or $ 2.27 a share, a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> had more shares outstanding a year ago.

 <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 34 percent rise in third-quarter earnings Thursday on the strength of its basic money-lending business, while across the continent the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> reported a $ 125.1 million loss related to an increased reserve for bad loans. Analysts said <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION>'s results reflected a remarkable turnaround at the nation's second-biggest banking company behind <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>. Only a few years ago <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> was wallowing in heavy losses. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> results underscored growing economic problems in once-thriving <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, which has put pressure on many banks that have lent money aggressively in that region. San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 254 million or $ 1.16 a share in the three months ended Sept. 30, vs. $ 190 million or 97 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter. The bank had an average of 201.49 million shares outstanding in the 1989 third-quarter vs. 178.91 million a year earlier. Combined net interest income and non-interest income totaled $ 1.47 billion, a 19.5 percent increase over $ 1.23 billion a year earlier. `` The quarter's results reflect continued strong performance in the fundamental areas of our business, particularly growth in consumer and residential mortgage loans,'' said <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> Chairman A.W. <PERSON> Clausen </PERSON>. `` Net credit losses were low during the quarter, capital and reserve levels increased, and expenses continued to be effectively controlled.'' For the nine months, <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 833 million or $ 4.07 a share, an 81 percent increase over the $ 461 million or $ 2.40 a share earned a year earlier. The bank had an average of 194.56 million shares outstanding in the first three quarters of 1989 vs. 172.19 million a year earlier. Combined net interest income and non-interest income for the nine months totaled $ 4.36 billion, an 18.2 percent increase over $ 3.69 billion a year earlier. At the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's 14th-largest banking concern, the third-quarter loss totaled $ 125.1 million or a per-share loss of $ 1.82, compared with earnings of $ 79.2 million or $ 1.14 a share a year earlier. The bank's average shares outstanding in the quarter totaled 78.68 million vs. 66.34 million. Combined net interest income and non-interest income for the third quarter totaled $ 430.6 million, a 5.4 percent decrease over the $ 455.3 million a year earlier. <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepanian </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said the results reflected the bank's previously announced $ 370 million addition to its reserve for possibly bad loans, due largely to a weakening real estate market. For the nine months, the bank earned $ 61.8 million or 73 cents a share, a 74 percent decline over the $ 239.6 million or $ 3.47 a share earned a year earlier. Average shares outstanding totaled 70.21 million vs. 65.92 million. Combined net interest income and non-interest income for the nine months totaled $ 1.39 billion vs. $ 1.35 billion, a 2.9 percent gain.

 Signs of a large Soviet purchase of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn pulled corn futures prices up sharply Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, and the other grain markets rallied in kind. `` It looks like <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> bought another 2 million -LRB- metric tons -RRB- of corn overnight and I believe it's true,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s floor operations at the exchange. He cited heavy buying of futures by grain exporters, which frequently signals a large foreign purchase. Rumors of Soviet buying of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybeans and soybean meal gave those markets an additional boost and wheat futures gained on a spillover of the bullish enthusiasm. Snow accumulations of up to six inches were expected overnight in the eastern Corn Belt, which would bring harvesting activity to a halt. But <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON> said forecasts for mild weekend temperatures and drier-than-normal conditions in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> next week minimized chances of significant harvest delays. At the close, wheat futures were -LCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 4.07 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 5 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.44 a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 1 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 1.46 a bushel; soybeans were 7 cents to 9 cents higher with November at $ 5.66 -RCB- a bushel.

<DATELINE>OLD GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> today reported its earnings increased 13 percent in the third quarter despite a 2 percent drop in revenue. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 166.4 million, or $ 1.71 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $ 146.8 million, or $ 1.53 per share, in the third quarter of 1988. Revenue declined to $ 3.06 billion from $ 3.13 billion. The company attributed the drop to the sale of its <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> insurance operation in March and to the impact of a stronger <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, which makes the company's products more expensive abroad. American Brands Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> said the company's core businesses, tobacco, distilled spirits and life insurance, all performed well during the quarter, with improvements in operating income The company said operating income was higher from its office products, hardware and home improvement operations, although revenue and operating income were lower for specialty business, including golf products and housewares. For the first nine months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 458.8 million, or $ 4.76 per share, up from $ 452 million, or $ 4.50 per share, in the same period a year ago.

 Computer systems are providing an electronic lifeline between isolated earthquake victims in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and anxious relatives back home. <ORGANIZATION> CompuServe </ORGANIZATION>, a Columbus-based computer information company with 550,000 individual and 1,800 corporate customers worldwide, put an `` earthquake forum'' on line about 5 p.m. EDT Wednesday, said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, manager of editorial services. By 11 a.m. Thursday, more than 430 messages _ many seeking information about relatives and friends living in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ had been filed. `` This is sort of like what ham radio operators do, only it's on a computer,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. `` It's setting a lot of the information coming out of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> straight in an accurate and timely manner _ often more quickly than the news media can.'' Another computer information services company, Prodigy, had such a system operating less than four hours after the earthquake hit, said communications manager <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ek </PERSON>. The company, based in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, launched its service in October 1988 and has subscribers in more than 100,000 households across the country. As of Thursday afternoon, 1,530 messages had been entered, he said. Among the other computer bulletin board services that went into action after the quake was The Well, which is based in <LOCATION> Sausalito </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and has about two-thirds of its 3,000 subscribers in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. Many of the messages sent through <ORGANIZATION> CompuServe </ORGANIZATION> have sought information about things such as road closings, but others were more personal. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> man trying to find a couple in <LOCATION> Burlingame </LOCATION> turned to the computer network for help. About an hour later, he received word that they not only survived the earthquake but had become grandparents. He also learned that the mother of one of his friends had been widowed the day before the earthquake hit. Computer samaritans across the country offered to act as messengers for those who could n't reach loved ones by phone. An Oakland-area woman reported `` for anybody worrying about their daughter'' at <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, the students were shaken but otherwise fine. One man from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> sought help in finding friends vacationing in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, but their whereabouts were not known. Word also came from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> that a woman sustained no damage to her house, but her bird bath was tipped over. The <ORGANIZATION> CompuServe </ORGANIZATION> system is available only to members, who pay $ 12.50 an hour to access the electronic billboard through their personal computers. <PERSON> Ek </PERSON> said the messages filed on the Prodigy service have been similar. But the company took the service, for which subscribers pay $ 9.95 a month, a step further. The company put a local psychologist on line Wednesday night `` to help these people deal with the trauma. We had one person who know some of the people involved in the Nimitz highway situation who was pretty distraught,'' he said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he is not surprised at the offers of help from stranger to stranger. `` This is not uncharacteristic of the on-line computer community,'' he said. `` We're a tightly knit, caring group of people. We like to show the human side of personal computing.''

 Stock prices chalked up a broad gain today, extending their recovery from the `` Friday the 13th massacre'' with encouragement from better-than-expected inflation news. After taking a 190.58-point tumble last Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrials recovered 73.39 points over this week's first three sessions. The average got an added lift today when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the consumer price index rose just 0.2 percent in September. The increase was about half of what had been expected, given a marked upswing in the producer price index of finished goods reported last week for September. Interest rates fell in the credit markets in response to the news. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction from interest rates, rose about $ 5 for each $ 1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 7.98 percent-8 .05 percent range

 With damage in the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake being estimated as high at $ 1 billion or more, insurance officials say only five other natural disasters have had higher dollar price tags. Because of inflation, the dollar cost of natural disasters from earlier times ca n't be directly compared to the dollar cost of the Bay Quake. The <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that while the final cost of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> region quake will not be known for some time, it will likely top $ 1 billion. Only five other disasters in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have had price tags in excess of that amount, the association reported. Those are Hurricane Hugo, with the cleanup still under way but costs expected to reach $ 3.98 billion; <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agnes </ORGANIZATION>, 1972, $ 3 billion; <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camille </ORGANIZATION>, 1969, $ 1.42 billion; <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Betsy </ORGANIZATION>, 1965, $ 1.4 billion, and the eruption of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helens </LOCATION>, 1980, $ 1.1 billion. The next most costly earthquake, the insurance agents reported, was the 1971 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> quake, where losses were estimated at $ 553 million. The great <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> quake of 1906 caused an estimated $ 524 million in damage, according to the agents group. In today's dollars that would be $ 5 billion to $ 5.8 billion, the group said That is a huge sum considering that <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> was a far smaller city in 1906.

 Assets of the nation's 473 money market mutual funds surged by $ 6.07 billion in the latest week to a record $ 356.10 billion, reflecting an investor exodus from stocks into safer investments following the Oct. 13 Wall Street plunge, the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. It was the biggest rise in fund assets since the week of another large decline in stock prices, Jan. 13, 1988, when assets rose by $ 7.62 billion. The latest rise broke the record total set the previous week, when fund assets totaled $ 350.03 billion. The institute originally reported that figure as $ 349.37 billion but revised it upward. <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON>, chief economist and senior vice president of the Washington-based mutual fund trade group, attributed the latest rise to investors who sought safe havens for their money after the stock market dropped sharply Oct. 13, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 190 points. The biggest weekly rise in funds assets _ $ 9.64 billion in the week ended Oct. 21, 1987 _ came during the stock market collapse, when the Dow average fell a record 508 points in a single session. The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 235 general purpose funds rose $ 2.53 billion to $ 116.56 billion, assets of 96 broker-dealer funds increased $ 1.30 billion to $ 154.05 billion, and assets of 142 institutional funds rose $ 2.23 billion to $ 85.49 billion. The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in the week ended Tuesday to 8.21 percent from 8.26 percent the previous week, said <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s Money Fund Report, a trade journal based in <LOCATION> Holliston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The 30-day average yield fell to 8.26 percent from 8.27 percent, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s said. The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 38 days, unchanged from the previous week. The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to 6.41 percent as of Wednesday from 6.42 percent a week earlier. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW accounts, fell to 5.10 percent from 5.11 percent. Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.22 percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.28 the previous week. Yields were 8.26 percent on 1-year CDs, down from 8.33 percent; 8.18 percent on 2 -LCB- - year CDs, down from 8.24 percent; and 8.16 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.22 percent

The new venture is an effort to answer growing demand for high-quality, coated sheet steel, primarily for domestic and Japanese automakers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and other sheet steel consumers, such as makers of appliances and office furniture. The companies hope to reach a definitive agreement by year's end on a 50-50 equity partnership. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Kobe </PERSON> plan to jointly design and build a state-of-the-art plant somewhere in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to produce 600,000 tons per year. Construction could begin next spring and production could begin two years later. The steel will be coated by dipping it in molten zinc, a process once limited to culverts, water pails, garbage cans and other low-grade uses. Hot-dip galvanizing has become increasingly sophisticated and now can compete with sheets coated by electrolysis, or electrogalvanizing, said <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal engineers have stepped up an investigation of four <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> models following complaints of malfunctioning cruise controls, the government said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said its investigation of speed controls in the 1986 and 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tempo </ORGANIZATION> and Mustang and the Mercury Topaz and Capri was being upgraded from a preliminary evaluation to an engineering analysis. The change means engineers will study the potentially defective parts as opposed to just paperwork analysis. The investigations help the agency decide whether to seek recalls. Fifty-five customers have complained that the cruise controls do not disengage properly, forcing drivers to hit the brakes to slow the cars, agency spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. The problem has been blamed for two accidents and three injuries. In <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said the company was investigating the purported defect but had reached no conclusions. `` It's always our policy to cooperate fully with <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> in their investigations, and we will do so in this case,'' she said. An estimated 562,000 of the 1986-87 Tempos, <ORGANIZATION> Mustangs </ORGANIZATION>, Topazes and Capris are on the road, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. The agency also said it was launching several new investigations and calling off some probes for lack of evidence the public was endangered. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> also upgraded to an engineering analysis its probe of 1985 Toyota vans and cargo vans, of which 104,100 are on the road. There have been five complaints alleging eight accidents caused by steering gear failure and resulting loss of control over the vehicles. An engineering analysis of hydraulic fuel leaks in the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 500 was halted despite 663 complaints of hydraulic fuel leaks causing loss of power steering and brakes. Engineers determined the problem is not a safety hazard because the cars can be controlled with manual brakes and steering, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. An estimated 90,000 are on the road. The agency opened preliminary evaluations of: _ Reports that on hard turns, the front wheels of 1987, 1988 and 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LeBarons </ORGANIZATION> rub on something under the car, causing tire wear An estimated 600,000 are on the road. _ Four complaints of locking wheels and steering systems in 180,000 Chevrolet Berettas from 1988, causing two accidents and one injury _ Fractured rear axle shafts in 1.2 million Chevrolet Camaros and <ORGANIZATION> Pontiac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firebirds </ORGANIZATION> from the 1982 through 1988 model years Six accidents and three injuries have been reported. _ Alleged transmission oil leaks in the 1988-89 Ford Probe and <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> MX6, which are built in the same facilities and have similar designs Two Probe fires have been reported. _ Fires under dashboards of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Voyager Caravans from 1984-1989 Ten fires have been reported; 1.5 million vehicles are on the road. _ Brake failure in the 1986-88 <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bonneville </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LeSabre </ORGANIZATION> and Oldsmobile 88 There have been 35 complaints alleging six accidents and three injuries. An estimated 1.2 million of the cars are in use. Preliminary evaluations also were begun on two child-restraint seat models. There have been complaints of children pulling off and putting in their mouths metallic labels of the Fisher Price model 9100 made in 1988 and foam rubber from Century Products models 4365DT and 4366BH made in 1989. The agency closed the books on three preliminary evaluations, finding no defect trends. Those included investigations of axle seal failures in 643,800 General Motors Safari and Astro minivans from 1985-88; breaking stabilizer bars in 567,000 Toyota Tercels from 1982-88; and wearing parking brake cable sheaths on the <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlo </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Oldsmobile </ORGANIZATION> 88 and <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> Grand Prix from 1985-88.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Prices Finish Mostly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oil futures prices ended mostly higher Thursday, boosted in part by strength in the heating oil market. Energy prices were unaffected for the second day by the devastating <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> earthquake. Most gasoline pipelines closed after the quake hit on Tuesday were reopened by late Wednesday and refineries were reported operating at or near normal. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the November contract for domestic heating oil rose 0.29 cent to finish at 60.89 cents a gallon, after dipping 0.45 cent in the previous session. `` I like the way heating oil came back today,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It could be partly because there is a bigger shortage in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> than we realize.'' Colder weather in many parts of the country also helped prices, traders said. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for November delivery closed 0.07 cent higher at 54.65 cents a gallon after a 1.26 cent decline on Wednesday. Prices of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate crude were mostly higher with the exception of the November contract, which closed down 14 cents at $ 20.42 a barrel. The contract for December delivery settled 17 cents higher at $ 20.42 and January finished at $ 20.18, up 22 cents. Projections of higher fourth-quarter demand by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>' technical committee had no immediate impact on the market, traders said. The <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> committee projected that worldwide demand for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil would increase by 600,000 barrels a day to 23.1 million barrels in the final quarter of 1989 from the estimated 22.5 million barrels that the cartel is now producing.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> posted a 39 percent drop in third-quarter profit due partly to lower refining earnings and an $ 80 million charge for environmental programs, the company said Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Schlumberger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, reported its third-quarter profit rose nearly 2 percent as oilfield earnings offset a decrease in interest income.

Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> said its third-quarter earnings tumbled to $ 336 million, or 65 cents a share, from $ 552 million, or $ 1.07 a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue climbed 12 percent to $ 6.6 billion, from $ 5.9 billion a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION>'s nine-month earnings declined 24 percent to $ 1.3 billion, or $ 2.50 a share, from $ 1.7 billion, or $ 3.28 a share, in the same 1988 period. The oil company's revenue, meanwhile, climbed 12 percent to $ 19.9 billion from $ 17.7 billion in 1988. For the three-month period ended Sept. 30, New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Schlumberger </ORGANIZATION> said its net income totaled $ 114.2 million, or 48 cents a share, compared with $ 112.2 million, or 42 cents a share, in the same 1988 quarter. Revenue totaled $ 1.12 billion, down 6 percent from $ 1.18 billion a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> said an $ 80 million charge to `` increase provisions for future costs of refining and marketing environmental programs'' helped reduce third-quarter results. Also contributing to the third-quarter decline were lower production earnings overseas _ $ 12 million compared with $ 95 million in the 1988 third period _ and lower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refining, marketing and transportation income _ $ 134 million vs. $ 319 million a year ago. In addition, higher interest income and operating costs offset the favorable effects of higher crude oil prices and increased natural gas and crude oil production, <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Schlumberger </ORGANIZATION>'s income in the first nine months fell 9.5 percent to $ 323.4 million, or $ 1.36 a share, from $ 357.2 million, or $ 1.32 a share, in the comparable 1988 period. Revenue declined 5 percent to $ 3.48 billion from $ 3.68 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Schlumberger </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Euan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> said the company experienced growth in its oilfield services unit in the third period despite a 9 percent decline in the average number of active rigs worldwide. That helped offset a decrease in interest income stemming from a $ 1.2 billion stock buyback in 1988. The nine-month figures include a gain of $ 13 million, or 5 cents a share, from the sale of a defense systems unit and a $ 22 million extraordinary gain from an award by the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal. The award stemmed from a claim filed by <ORGANIZATION> Schlumberger </ORGANIZATION> over oilfield equipment left in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> a decade earlier when many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies evacuated the country due to political turmoil and the rescinding of oil exploration agreements. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Ashland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, said its fourth-quarter charges include $ 38 million from a previously announced $ 325 million settlement with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a $ 15 million charge from the planned sale of <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary and a $ 25 million charge stemming from costs to correct performance problems at its Riley Consolidated subsidiary. The out-of-court settlement with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> involved claims for oil that had not been paid for a decade ago when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> rescinded exploration agreements with <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> as well as other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil companies. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> said it plans to announce its results next week. In last year's fourth quarter, the company had net income of $ 66 million, or $ 1.19 a share, on revenue of $ 2.2 billion. For the 1988 fiscal year, it had net income of $ 224 million, or $ 4.01, a share, on revenue of $ 8.2 billion.

 The dollar finished mixed against major foreign currencies Thursday at the end of an uneventful session. Gold prices eased in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after posting scattered gains and losses overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold for current delivery settled at $ 367.10 a troy ounce, down $ 1.60 from Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> quoted a troy ounce of gold at $ 366.50 at 4 p.m. EDT, $ 2.20 lower than Wednesday's late bid. Currency dealers in financial centers around the world temporarily sold dollars when news broke that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consumer Price Index went up a modest 0.2 percent in September. But the unexpectedly small inflation rate, released at the start of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business day, had little lasting impact on currency trading. Speculation about the chances for lower interest rates circulated in the markets and tended to temper any urge to buy dollars, dealers said. The low inflation reading could give the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> greater leeway to ease monetary tightness, leading to lower interest rates. `` There was no real direction in the market,'' said <PERSON> Siobhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackey </PERSON>, an assistant on the foreign exchange desk of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Julius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` There was n't that wild of a reaction to the inflation news.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to 141.55 yen from 142.10 yen at Wednesday's close. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it fell further to 141.25 yen. But at the end of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s day the dollar was quoted at 142 yen, stronger than Wednesday's late level of 141.40 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.5940 from $ 1.5880 late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a pound fetched $ 1.5975 vs. $ 1.5922 on Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> compared with Wednesday's quotes included: 1.8500 West German marks, up from 1.8485; 1.6205 Swiss francs, down from 1.6243; 6.27895 French francs, down from 6.2810; 1.17405 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17335; and 1,360.95 Italian lire, down from 1,362.00 Late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late rates on Wednesday, included: 1.8525 West German marks, unchanged; 1.6225 Swiss francs, down from 1.6255; 6.2875 French francs, down from 6.2990; 2.0820 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0818; 1,358.50 Italian lire, down from 1,366.00; and 1.1741 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1737.

<HEAD>Soviet Purchase Boosts Corn Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Signs of a large Soviet purchase of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn pulled corn futures prices up sharply Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and it was n't just idle speculation. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> confirmed after the close that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had bought 1.2 million metric tons of corn. On other commodity markets, copper futures rallied while precious metals retreated; stock-index futures soared; energy futures advanced and livestock and meat futures were mixed. Corn settled 2 cents to 5 -RCB- cents higher with the contract for December delivery at $ 2.44 a bushel. Wheat futures finished -LCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 4.07 -RCB- a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 1 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 1.46 a bushel; soybeans were 7 cents to 9 cents higher with November at $ 5.66 -RCB- a bushel. Heavy buying of corn futures by grain exporters, freqently a signal of a large foreign purchase, fueled speculation that the Soviets had been in the market overnight. The purchase had been rumored to be as large as 2 million metric tons. Persistent rumors of Soviet interest in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean meal and soybean oil continued on Thursday, giving the soybean complex a boost, and wheat futures gained as the enthusiasm spread from the corn and soybean pits to the wheat arena. Export sales of corn and soybeans typically increase in mid-autumn, when newly harvested crops increase the supply and bring prices down. `` A general rule of thumb in these markets is that after the harvest is past the halfway point you'll see a rally, and we're past the halfway point now,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> The harvest has suffered a setback this week due to cold, stormy weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, and a storm was expected to drop up to six inches of snow in the eastern Corn Belt overnight. But forecasts for mild weekend temperatures and drier-than-normal conditions next week minimized chances of significant harvest delays. `` If anyone bought today on weather, they bought for the wrong reason,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s floor operations at the Board of Trade Copper futures rallied modestly on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after slipping on Thursday below $ 1.27 a pound in a move that some analysts had interpreted as a signal the market was weakening significantly. Precious metals prices declined following the government's report of a lower-than-expected 0.2 percent rise in consumer prices last month Copper settled 1.3 cents to 2.3 cents higher with December at $ 1.2795 a pound; gold finished $ 1.80 lower across the board with December at $ 370.60 a troy ounce; silver was 2.5 cents to 2.8 cents lower with December at $ 5.133 a troy ounce. Stock-index futures advanced strongly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as jitters linked to last Friday's collapse continued to fade. The contract for December delivery of stocks tracked by the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 4.95 points higher at 349.60. The contract is valued at $ 500 a point. Most energy futures prices rallied on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, boosted by strength in the heating oil market. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 14 cents lower to 22 cents higher with November at $ 20.42 a barrel; heating oil was .01 cent lower to .36 cent higher with November at 60.89 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .05 cent to .10 cent higher with November at 54.65 cents a gallon. Livestock and meat trading was cautious on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> ahead of Friday's quarterly <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> cattle-on-feed report and Monday's monthly <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> cold-storage report Live cattle were .22 cent lower to .05 cent higher with October at 74.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .25 cent lower with October at 83 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower to .03 cent higher with October at 48.75 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .13 cent to .55 cent higher with February at 51.97 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Colgate-Palmolive Profit Climbs 28 Percent In Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its third-quarter profit rose 27.5 percent, aided by more efficient manufacturing operations and strong sales growth. For the three-month period ended Sept. 30, the consumer products company reported net income of $ 76.7 million, or $ 1.06 a share, up from $ 60.2 million, or 88 cents a share, in the same 1988 quarter. Revenue increased 6 percent to $ 1.26 billion from $ 1.19 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, markets its products under such brand names as <ORGANIZATION> Ajax </ORGANIZATION>, Fab and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION>, in addition to <ORGANIZATION> Colgate </ORGANIZATION> and Palmolive. Net income in the first nine months rose 14 percent to $ 217.5 million, or $ 3.09 a share, from $ 191.1 million, or $ 2.79 a share, in the comparable period last year. Sales grew by 7 percent to $ 3.75 billion from $ 3.52 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> said the company `` generated the highest return on sales in almost half a century, well in excess of our 5 percent target level'' in the latest quarter. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> said that in addition to strong domestic sales, all major geographic regions showed strong profit growth, particularly <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> despite the adverse effects of the stronger dollar. Net earnings also benefited from reduced net interest expense after the divestment of one of its units and the expansion of its employee stock ownership program. Volume increases, manufacturing efficiencies, and strategic price increases also helped boost pre-tax earnings by 32 percent, the company said.

<TEXT>
 Consumer prices rose an unexpectedly modest 0.2 percent in September, the government said Thursday, soothing frazzled financial markets. Investors took the report as an indication the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has room to lower interest rates, and the stock market rallied. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 39.55 points to 2,683.20. Inflation, which had been rising at a 6.7 percent annual rate from January through May, has abated to a 4.4 percent rate for the first nine months of the year. The inflation rate so far this year is the same as in both 1988 and 1987 and well under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's 1989 inflation projection of 5 percent. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, chief economic adviser at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, called the report `` good economic news.'' `` We're delighted to be able to say that, while we're always on guard to make sure that inflation remains under control, the concern earlier in the year that inflation was getting out of control appears to have been unfounded,'' he said. The seasonally adjusted increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Consumer Price Index follows no gain at all in August and similarly modest 0.2 percent rises in July and June Although private economists said inflation was likely to pick up in the fourth quarter, jittery stock and bond markets rallied on Thursday's news, interpreting it as a sign the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> likely will nudge interest rates lower. Because of the stock market turmoil set off by the Friday the 13th nosedive, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has eased a key interest rate from about 9 percent to 8.75 percent. Analysts predicted another quarter-point decline soon in the federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans. `` Under these circumstances, there is no question that interest rates will fall,'' said economist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacReynolds </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. In an effort to contain inflation, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been using high interest rates to slow the economy. Although wholesale-price inflation shot up 0.9 percent in September, other statistics for the month portray a sluggish economy with weakening manufacturing employment, industrial production and housing construction. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said new state unemployment claims for the week ending Oct. 7 grew 62,000 in a week's time to 396,000 That report amounted to a further indication of the economy's softness. _ The department said Americans' average real weekly earnings of $ 338.67 in September were up 3.5 percent from a year earlier _ not enough to keep up with inflation Adjusted for inflation, earnings rose 0.3 percent last month following a 0.7 percent decline in August. The nation's 38.9 million Social Security recipients watched Thursday's consumer-price report with particular interest because it affected the benefit increase they're due to receive in January. Benefits will climb 4.7 percent, the biggest boost in 7 -LCB- years, to offset the effects of inflation over the last year. The average monthly payment will climb $ 25 to $ 566. At the same time, the cap on Social Security payroll taxes will rise. Workers will have to pay the tax on their first $ 50,400 in wages, up from $ 48,000. Analysts were suprised by the September inflation data. They had been expecting higher crude oil costs to ripple through to gasoline pumps, pushing up prices overall by about 0.4 percent. But energy prices declined for the fourth consecutive month. Gasoline, down 2.2 percent in September, has fallen 9.3 percent in the last four months after increasing 21.2 percent in the first five months of the year. Fuel oil prices dropped 0.2 percent last month after declining 0.9 percent in August. Economist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said higher energy prices likely will show up when October's report is released. `` There has been an abatement of inflation, but it has n't been to the degree that this -LRB- 0.2 percent -RRB- number would suggest,'' he said. `` We're likely to have some less attractive numbers in the fourth quarter.' Food prices, which had shot up at a 9.3 percent annual rate through May, climbed at a rate of just 1.7 percent from June through September. They rose a moderate 0.2 percent last month, in part because of a 1.1 percent decline for fruits and vegetables. Coffee prices fell 2.7 percent last month. However, the index for dairy products jumped 1.4 percent, the largest monthly increase since May 1980. Clothing prices, after falling in the three preceding months, rose 1.7 percent in September, with another increase expected for October. Prices for apparel for women and girls, reflecting the introduction of new fall and winter fashions, were up 3.6 percent. Economist <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said the September report was favorably influenced by several price drops unlikely to be repeated. The cost of new cars fell 0.4 percent, the fifth drop in a row and the longest such string since the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> began tracking those prices in 1953, he said. Auto dealers `` are giving the ... things away,'' he said. `` There's a point where you just ca n't do more and I think they've reached that point. Tuition and school fees fell 0.4 percent, seasonally adjusted, while hotel and motel costs dropped 4.5 percent. The various changes left the overall Consumer Price Index at 125.0 in September, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods and services costing $ 100 in the 1982-84 base period would have cost $ 125 last month.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area earthquake revived a debate over whether 16-year-old federal seismic standards for nuclear power plants are tough enough. Tuesday's quake caused no damage to the five active nuclear reactors in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The three that were operating at the time are still running normally, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The five reactors are in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>: two at <LOCATION> Diablo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, 12 miles southwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>, and three at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Onofre </LOCATION>, five miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemente </LOCATION>. One reactor at each site was shut down for normal refueling when the quake hit. Under the 1973 standards set by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, each nuclear power plant must be built to quake-resistance specifications that differ according to local seismic conditions. The standards for Diablo Canyon are the stiffest in the country, <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said. The risk of nuclear plant accidents from earthquakes was a major point of contention between the industry and environmentalists during the 1960s and early 1970s, when site planning was done for most of the 110 plants now operating in this country. The chief danger is that a quake would cause a crack in the piping that carries cooling water to the reactor core. A rapid loss of coolant could cause the fuel rods in the core to melt, possibly allowing radioactive material to escape into the atmosphere. Although the seismic issue has faded in recent years, the environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, founded by consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, said Wednesday the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> quake underscored a need to reexamine the nuclear construction standards. `` Federal regulators should at least view -LRB- the -RRB- earthquake as a final warning that seismic standards and testing for all nuclear reactors as well as evacuation planning needs to be substantially upgraded before the next quake hits,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Bossong </PERSON>, director of Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project. <PERSON> Bossong </PERSON> said at least two nuclear plants are `` perilously close to known fault lines.'' He cited Diablo Canyon, which is near the <LOCATION> Hosgri </LOCATION> fault, and Millstone, near the point at which the <LOCATION> Honey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Char </LOCATION> fault lines intersect in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bossong </PERSON> also noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged that its three active nuclear reactors at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> weapons complex in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caroline </LOCATION>, which make materials for nuclear warheads, need to undergo seismic upgrades. Some specialists, however, say the seismic standards for commercial nuclear reactors are adequate. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, an environmental engineer with the consulting firm <ORGANIZATION> Roy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the standards are `` pretty conservative,'' although he acknowledges there is `` a lot of uncertainty'' in attempting to predict how structures such as nuclear plants would respond to the worst possible quake.

<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended Oct. 9, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,170.6 billion from $ 3,165.8 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 4,013.4 billion from $ 4,005.2 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 786.0 billion from $ 789.3 billion.

 The chief of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> credits <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with significant economic achievements and says the Japanese should now take the lead in eliminating trade barriers. `` It is particularly important for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to take further steps to improve market access for imported goods,'' said <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> Managing Director <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>. Specifically, the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> chief called for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to loosen quota and tariff restrictions on agricultural products, echoing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands aimed at reducing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s high trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>, former governor of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> and now head of the 152-nation <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, addressed the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Wednesday night and the text of his speech was released here Thursday. `` I believe that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is in a position to take unilateral steps to reduce trade barriers, and thus to assume a leadership role in promoting multilateral trade liberalization'' in the current global trade talks at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, he said. In addition to easing Japanese restrictions on foreign farm products, <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> called for reforms in land management and the distribution system. He said he supported <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s recent efforts to tighten credit in order to avert inflation but added there is also `` an urgent need for a more determined effort to remove structural impediments to growth.'' He said that while <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has made significant progress in boosting domestic demand in other areas the reforms have been limited. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are already holding bimonthly structural talks at which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are pressing for changes in Japanese distribution and land-use systems that they maintain are anticompetitive, discriminate against imports and penalize consumers. <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> said he agreed with the advice <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is giving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in their structural talks _ to reduce deficit spending and increase savings and investment. Conditions are favorable today for `` the major deficit countries'' to make needed changes, he said, naming only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Action to strengthen the public finances in many of these countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, would raise national savings, make room for an improvement in net export and reduce pressure on prices and interest rates,'' he said. <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japans </LOCATION>'s national savings rate never fell below 30 percent of gross national product during the 1980s. In 1988, when its surpluses were declining, it hit a peak of 33 percent, `` a remarkable performance, by any standards ... given the overall shortage of world savings in recent years.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personal savings rate, after taxable income, fell to 3.2 percent in 1987 and rose to 4.2 percent in 1988, while the comparable Japanese rate was 16.5 percent in 1987, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury figures.

 Stock prices rose broadly Thursday, marking the second anniversary of the Black Monday crash with a rally sparked by better-than-expected inflation news and extending the recovery from the market's latest slide. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which plunged 190.58 points last Friday, finished up 39.55 points at 2,683.20. The rise gave the widely followed market indicator a gain of 112.94 points during this week's first four sessions. Broader market indicators also rose, with seven issues advancing for every two that dropped on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The upsurge came on the second anniversary of the Oct. 19, 1987 Black Monday crash that saw the Dow industrials nosedive 508 points to 1,738.74. The market got a lift when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported the consumer price index rose just 0.2 percent in September. The increase was about half of what had been expected, given a sharp rise in the producer price index of finished goods reported last week for September. Interest rates fell in the credit markets in response to the news, which raised speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might have more leeway to push rates lower, making mortgages and other loans more affordable. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction from interest rates, rose about $ 7.50 for each $ 1,000 in face value, with the yield on the bellwether 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond falling to about 7.95 percent from 8.03 percent late Wednesday.

 Better-than-expected inflation news helped send stock prices broadly higher Thursday, extending the market's recovery from last week's `` Friday the 13th massacre'' and marking the second anniversary of its 1987 crash in style The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 39.55 points to 2,683.20.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In one of the federal government's largest real estate deals, regulators said Thursday they will sell a $ 428 million portfolio of property acquired through the bailout of insolvent thrifts in five states. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, announced the plan during a speech to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> real estate and financial executives. Of the 150 properties, 82 are in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the rest are in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. He said regulators hoped to sell the real estate in one package but would sell it in pieces if necessary. The properties, which include residential, commercial, industrial, retail and vacant land, are part of the $ 2.7 billion in assets being managed by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which is being dissolved under legislation rescuing the savings and loan industry. In addition, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> had received considerable interest in the <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> organization, which is being sold separately through sealed bids due Oct. 31. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the agency created to supervise the thrift bailout, will take over an additional 300 insolvent S & amp; Ls this year, giving it control of more than 600 institutions and more than $ 350 billion in deposits. Separately, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said the $ 50 billion <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> provided to rescue the thrift industry may be enough if losses continue to decline at the current rapid rate. In the past, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> has indicated <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may have to appropriate more money. Overall, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> eventually will have to return $ 65 billion to $ 70 billion of repossessed real estate into private hands. `` I do n't think it will be sold in the five years that the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> is mandated to sell it. It's going to be a factor in the market over the next decade,'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> told reporters after his speech. He said it would be at least a year before regulators begin selling most of the properties.

 In 1971, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> gathered a group of people on an Italian hillside near <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and taught the world to sing.
