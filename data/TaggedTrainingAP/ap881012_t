 A state-by-state poll of nearly 10,000 likely voters Wednesday rated <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as solidly ahead in the race for the presidency, saying he held a huge lead in the contest for electoral votes. Although polls of the nation as a whole indicate a close race between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> survey of the standings in each state _ where the election actually is decided _ put <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> firmly ahead. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led solidly in 21 states with a total of 220 electoral votes _ just 50 short of the total needed to win. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was firmly ahead in three states and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, for 30 electoral votes. With the election nearly a month off, voter sentiments can change. But the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-Post </ORGANIZATION> poll, the only public survey of its size this year, was the first recent poll to indicate a significant advantage for either candidate. `` It's interesting and encouraging,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't know what the other fellow has But look, we've just got a game plan. Stay with it. And if polls are encouraging it makes me feel good, but I also remember when they were n't.'' The poll was conducted from Sept. 21 through Monday among 9,778 likely voters in the 50 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Its margins of error varied by state from five points to 10 points. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and the Post also conducted a standard national survey that put the race at 51 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to 45 percent to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll Wednesday had nearly the same result: 50-45. Such national polls measure popular sentiment across the nation as a whole. But in the election each state gives its electoral votes to the winner in that state, so the state-by-state standings are more relevant to the outcome. Such polls are rarely done because conducting polls in each state requires a far larger sample than surveying the nation as a whole. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, from 100 to 500 voters were interviewed in each state. The Post noted that there are many potential sources of error in the poll, including the length of time it took to conduct the survey. The states that <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> put firmly in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s column included <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where recent state polls have given him a 10-point lead; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, where he led by eight points in a state poll last week; and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where he led in a state poll a month ago by just four points. Also, the states that it said leaned toward <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> included <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where most other recent polls have shown a slight <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lead; and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where most recent polls have found a tie. These are the states that <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said firmly favored <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. It said these were leaning for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> rated these states a tossup: <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Firmly favoring <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> it said, were <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Leaning for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. The CBS-Times poll, meanwhile, found increasing doubt about the qualifications of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, to serve as president, and it indicated the concern was keeping the race a close one in terms of the popular contest nationally. By a 2-1 margin, probable voters in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll doubted <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications for the presidency, his worst rating in that survey. He was seen as qualified by only 30 percent, while twice as many _ 63 percent _ said they would worry about him serving as president. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s presence appeared to help <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: Asked if they could vote only for president, without considering the running mate, support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dipped from 45 percent to 41 percent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support remained at 50 percent Another poll Wednesday, by <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, put the popular contest at 50-48. It also said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> may be helped a bit by concern over <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>; asked to chose between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> only, without their running mates mentioned, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dipped from 48 to 46 percent support. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> remained at 50 percent. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> polled 1,355 likely voters Oct. 6 through Monday. Its poll had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. The smaller, national ABC-Post poll was done Oct. 5 through Tuesday among 1,187 likely voters nationwide; The CBS-Times poll was done Oct. 8 through Monday among 1,009 probable voters. Both had four-point margins of error.

 A hotel owner criticized for throwing <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> birthday parties for his employees said Wednesday he plans to donate his collection of Nazi material to a planned Holocaust museum in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>, 58, who owns the Imperial Palace hotel and casino, said he began discussions Wednesday with officials of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Holocaust Memorial Council toward donating the Nazi items. `` We have offered it. They have expressed interest in having it,'' <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>, who earlier painted over a <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> wall mural and scrapped plans to display the Nazi items at his car museum, said he hoped the planned donation to the Holocaust museum would end the flap over his activities. `` As I said earlier, I now feel I have done what can be done,'' <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> said, reading from a statement. `` I have apologized for what can not be undone.'' <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> said he hoped to donate the various Nazi artifacts to a Holocaust museum that is being planned by the council in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But he said he would keep the various cars he has bought that are related to the Nazi regime. In a letter to the Jewish Federation of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> said he would sell the collection of Nazi-era cars, motorcycles, posters and other items and turn the room into a warehouse. `` I have not been successful to date in convincing you that my apology for my insensitivity to Jewish concerns was heartfelt and sincere,'' <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> wrote. `` In retrospect, I realize that what was missing in my apology was an acknowledgement of the specific hurt and pain felt by the Jewish community over this issue,'' he said. <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>, a former goaltender on the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION>'s hockey team, announced plans earlier this year to set up a $ 5 million endowment to benefit the university's hockey program. The school's Winter Sports Center was subsequently renamed <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>. Officials said the university does n't plan to reject <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>'s money and wo n't change the name of the hockey venue But school President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said school officials would watch the controversy for any new developments, and `` we're keeping our options open.'' <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Thief </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, has apologized for the two <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> parties, which he held in 1986 and earlier this year. `` In retrospect, they were not only stupid but insensitive, but at the time they were merely excuses for parties,'' <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> said, adding that he threw parties often for his employees. <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>'s collection included a portrait of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, signed `` To <PERSON> Ralphie </PERSON> from Adolf 1938,'' and a bumper sticker inscribed `` Hitler Was Right.'' <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> has said the portrait was sent to him by a <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> broker as a joke after he purchased a number of German vehicles. <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> did not authorize the bumper stickers and found them offensive, he said.

 Neither <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> came in contact with the voters on Wednesday, huddling instead with their handlers to go over lines for Thursday's second and final presidential debate of the campaign. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, buoyed by an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll giving him a huge lead in electoral votes nationwide, staged a brief made-for-television event before disappearing into his debate preparation meetings. He invited <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> in for breakfast in a subtle continuation of his effort to make crime control a central theme of his candidacy. The vice president told reporters he intended to show the country `` what my heartbeat is'' during his face-to-face clash with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and said he would continue depicting his rival as a liberal. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also attended the National League playoff game between the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> after wrapping up his debate preparation for the day. He shared a box with his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, Dodger owner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Malley </PERSON>, and campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Democrat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had baseball on his mind as well as he interrupted his debate homework to play catch with an aide while photographers recorded the scene. Referring to the first presidential debate and the one last week between running mates, he said, `` We're ahead 2-0; we're going to make it a clean sweep.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will need a clean sweep to overcome the kind of lead that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has in the newest poll, which surveyed 10,000 likely voters from Sept. 21 through Monday. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led solidly in 21 states with a total of 220 electoral votes _ just 50 short of the total needed to win. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was firmly ahead in only three states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> with 30 electoral votes. With the election nearly a month off, voter sentiments can change. But the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-Post </ORGANIZATION> poll, the only public survey of its size this year, was the first recent poll to indicate a significant advantage for either candidate. The poll's margins of error varied by state from five points to 10 points. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said from 100 to 500 voters were interviewed in each state. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> described his debate repertoire in baseball lingo, as well, saying he would use a `` fastball, curve, slider _ maybe a knuckler'' during his 90 minutes on stage. Workers in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> erected a debate-night set _ wooden lecterns, red carpet and telegenic blue background _ that was trucked in from <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, where it was used in last week's vice presidential debate. The debate begins at 9 p.m. EDT on the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> campus in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> goes into the 90-minute encounter with a modest lead in the public opinion polls, although <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appears to have cut into the Republican advantage since last week's vice presidential debate. Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the subject of anonymous criticism from senior <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advisers since that debate, said as he set out on his daily campaign rounds that if he finds out who was talking, `` I think there will be staff changes.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> uttered a seeming declaration of independence after saying his campaign appearances had been so tightly scripted by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advisers that he was told when he could wave as he got off his campaign plane. `` That's all been thrown away,'' he said. `` I am my own handler, and if you have any questions, ask me.'' He said he would take advice from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aides `` under consideration.'' Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had a ready retort for that idea. `` That may be his pitch, but I'll bet it's thrown <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a real curve ball,'' he said of his vice presidential rival. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator campaigned through <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, where he said the Republicans `` refuse to stand up for the American economy.'' With election day still more than three weeks away, there was fresh evidence that presidential politics is eternal. One Democratic official already was speculating that the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, the lead-off contest in the last several campaigns, might be moved back in the election calendar if the Democrats lose the White House this year. `` I think that the cry would be very loud for a different look at the nominating system,'' said Democratic Vice Chair <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON>, a former Iowan now living in <LOCATION> Washingon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s breakfast with Republican supporter <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> came as the vice president worked hard to make crime a key issue. In speeches throughout the country, he has sharply criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record on crime, citing a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison program under which a murderer escaped while on furlough and attacked a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> couple. Some Democratic strategists say the issue is particularly effective against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the nation's largest state. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he believes he is in a stronger position politically than before the first residential debate on Sept. 25 and added that his goal for Thursday night is to have the voters understand `` what my heartbeat is, what I really care about.'' As for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, the losing 1984 Democratic presidential candidate, said the 1988 nominee should loosen up in front of the television cameras. <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, that he knows <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a `` very warm nice person'' but that that side of his personality has n't come across on television. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had his No. 1 surrogate campaigner at work, with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> traveling in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. In a speech to high school students in <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Darby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> touted the economic expansion since the recession early in his term of office and said, `` In the last eight years we've worked to return <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s values to all areas of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> government.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and its food service, plant operations and library workers reached a contract agreement on Wednesday just hours before a midnight strike dedline. After two days of negotiations, the <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> school agreed to pay full health insurance premiums for members of Local 134 of the <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> union. `` We feel that we have a great victory here,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> McAninch </PERSON>, the union's business agent. `` The important thing is we got 100 percent Blue Cross coverage for the life of the agreement. A three-year contract for the 250 plant and food workers provided a 5.5 percent pay increase in the first year and a 5 percent increase in the remaining two years. The 90 library workers received a two-year contract that gave them a 5.5 percent increase in the first year and a 5 percent raise in the second. The contract was ratified by a show of hands by the plant and food workers and by a 50-21 vote from the library workers, <PERSON> McAninch </PERSON> said. The workers earlier this month authorized a strike for midnight Wednesday, when the contract covering plant and food workers expires. The contract for the library workers expired on Aug. 19. `` Both sides gave substantially in the interest of harmony to get the matter resolved,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichley </PERSON>, a university spokesman. `` In the long run it may not be the best solution for both sides, but at least it averted a strike.'' On Tuesday, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> officials offered a higher wage increase, but said they would pay only half the insurance premiums for the first year and 60 percent of following increases. <PERSON> McAninch </PERSON> said the principle of cost shifting was as important as the numbers. `` They knew that we were serious about striking and that we felt very strongly about the issues,'' she said. `` We had a lot of support from <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students.''

 This Central African nation kept a long official silence on AIDS, but now is attacking the epidemic openly and plans to test 10,000 people in its first survey of the deadly disease. `` We know that it is a difficult problem, but we are trying to do what we can do,'' said Dr. <PERSON> N'Galy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosenge </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>'s national AIDS committee Reporters visiting <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION> in the past had to seek information from Western health officials or private organizations involved in fighting AIDS. N'Galy, whose business card shows a skull in the middle of a heart beneath the French abbreviation for AIDS, now admits them to his office without demanding government authorization and even takes telephone queries from journalists in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, for which no cure has been found, is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring. Although homosexuals have been the main victims in developed countries, the disease has spread among heterosexuals in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. This may be because of the unchecked spread of other sexually transmitted diseases, which speed the transmission of AIDS; because of contaminated syringes and blood supplies, and because there are comparatively few homosexuals on the continent. <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Netter </PERSON> said by telephone from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency's <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> headquarters that <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries have quickened their AIDS programs in the past 18 months. `` It's an acknowledgment that this is a problem and ... it's no longer seen as some sort of a stigma,'' he said. `` I think people have gotten over that.'' African nations were reporting five to 10 cases 18 months ago but now the total is about 19,000, he said. <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> recently held an international AIDS conference, and <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION> did the same in June. <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and several other countries have begun aggressive education campaigns that use comic books, popular music, television and theater. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s daily newspaper for blacks, The Sowetan, began a column on AIDS this week, which warns that promiscuity facilitates transmission of the disease. A WHO statement Friday said reported AIDS cases worldwide rose 7 percent to 119,818 in September, with updated figures from <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> accounting for most of the increase. <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> listed 2,586 cases, more than four times the number in its last report Oct. 31, 1987; <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> reported 3,055 cases, nearly twice the total of Oct. 17, 1988, and <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> reported 2,732 cases, up one-third from a March 31, 1988, report that also showed a big increase. <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> has reported only 335 cases. <PERSON> N'Galy </PERSON> said his government knows the figure is many times that, but `` we just did n't do a very good job. ... We ca n't verify it yet.'' <PERSON> N'Galy </PERSON> said he was preparing a new total figure. The government has been sensitive because of press reports describing <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> as the birthplace of AIDS and because of the reaction to reports of a survey that found 6 percent to 8 percent of the staff of a <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION> hospital to be sero-positive. `` It was regarded as a national catastrophe,'' <PERSON> Ngaly </PERSON> said. Officials in <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> say their openess about AIDS has resulted wrongly in that East African country being labeled an AIDS epicenter. Dr. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Okware </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>'s AIDS control program, said the number of cases doubles every six months. N'Galy said <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> is preparing its first general AIDS survey in cooperation with WHO, and about 10,000 people will be tested. He said it probably will find a sero-positive rate somewhere between the 6 percent to 8 percent at the hospital and the 3 percent to 4 percent found in tests at a <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION> factory. The survey's purpose is `` to evaluate the success of our AIDS education program,'' <PERSON> N'Galy </PERSON> said. `` The most important thing is to check the rate of AIDS infection. We are confident that people understand the need for change, but it is a long-term effort. Perhaps we will be able to save some lives.'' <PERSON> Netter </PERSON> said the survey `` probably will come up with a lot of cases,'' but added: `` The most significant thing is that there is a program in place to find out what the extent of the problem is and how to go about doing something about it.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, said condom sales have gone from virtually zero to 100,000 monthly in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION> and surveys indicate most residents know as much about AIDS as people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Reports indicate the disease may not be spreading to rural areas, and `` in many villages the sero-positive rate remains zero,'' according to N'Galy. Tests in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION> of pregnant women and blood donors also suggest the general incidence of AIDS infection is not rising, but the infection rate among prostitutes has grown from 27 percent to 40 percent.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> suspended the <ORGANIZATION> Sigma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epsilon </ORGANIZATION> fraternity Tuesday after an `` extended period of disruptive behavior'' that included a member being charged with raping a sorority pledge. And in <LOCATION> Orono </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> withdrew recognition of a sorority after a hazing inciden in which pledges allegedly were branded with a heated metal stamp. The earliest the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> fraternity will be eligible to return to campus is Jan. 1, said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON>, university vice chancellor for student affairs. Last month, the university banned all on-campus fraternity-sorority parties when a freshman Chi Omega Sorority pledge said she was raped after attending a mixer held by the fraternity and the sorority. That party was held off-campus because the fraternity was already on social probation because of a rush infraction and was prohibited from having on-campus parties. <PERSON> Stover </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Metairie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, was freed late last month on $ 50,000 bond after being arrested on rape charges, said <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. The woman told officers that she left the party and was driven to a field, then beaten and raped, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. University officials said the rape charge was not the only reason for the suspension of the fraternity, but it was a contributing factor. The unversity began an investigation into the fraternity's activities after the incident. The suspension means removal of all fraternity members from the campus chapter and the placing of the chapter in the hands of an alumni committee, <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON> said. The identities of the victims in the Sept. 25 incident in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, said to have occurred in a <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION> cemetery, were not disclosed. Officials said a preliminary investigation found that two pledges had suffered burns. An associate dean, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>, said the burns had been characterized as minor. Hazing is prohibited by both state law and school policy, university officials said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has reaffirmed that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> will remain its own master on defense issues, saying <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s `` mission was not to assure the protection of any other West European country.'' That task, he said Tuesday, belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said, however, that a French president could realize <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s vital interests were affected by events beyond its borders and, for example, come to the aid of its neighbor <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in an emergency. Other points <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> made in a major policy speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>: _ <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s new mobile short-range Hades nuclear missiles should not become theater or battlefield weapons, but serve as a final warning to an enemy that a nuclear confrontation was starting _ <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> would continue to modernize its mainly submarine-based nuclear deterrent, but would also update a missile complex in southern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> retains the capability of building a neutron bomb at any moment _ <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> will not join any negotiations on reducing strategic nuclear weapons until deep cuts were made in the arsenals of both superpowers _ <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> opposes deployment of weapons in space as envisaged in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Administration's Strategic Defense Initiative _ <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> will keep its chemical weapons capability until an international ban on their manufacture and use is negotiated <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said the main objective of French defense policy was to `` maintain our identity, our independence,'' which is why `` we have our own strategy of nuclear deterrence.'' He said <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was committed to achieving nuclear disarmament and hailed the U.S.-Soviet accord to ban intermediate-range nuclear weapons as one of the major events since the end of World War II. He said <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> will remain a reliable member of the Western alliance without `` abandoning its autonomy of decision'' with regard to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s integrated military command structure. Gen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaullle </PERSON> took <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> out of this structure in 1966. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said in the event of war, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> `` will be present from the first minute with all its forces, including nuclear ones, provided that this was within the framework of the alliance.'' He remarked that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s common defensive capabilities could be strengthened in 1993 after the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> established a single market. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> warned any attack against <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s land-based missiles would mean `` we were at war and the unleashing of our strategic weapons would be instantaneous.'' The president said with regard to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s short-range nuclear weapons, such as the Pluton or Hades missiles, that these weapons would be used only against military targets. The Hades, to be deployed in eastern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> by 1992, has a range of about 280 miles, barely enough to reach targets in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or other <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries. Newspaper reports last month, denied by <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> aides, said <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was considering delaying or canceling the Hades program.

<HEAD>Labor Fights For Crucial Sephardi Vote In Likud Strongholds</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RAMLE, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cheering children greeted Moroccan-born <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, the No. 2 man in the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, during a campaign stop in this town where two-thirds of the residents are Jews of North African origin. When <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, head of the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, campaigned in <LOCATION> Ramle </LOCATION>'s open-air market last week, he was jostled and booed. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> supporters shouted `` traitor'' and `` <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> go home.'' The contrasting receptions underscore <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s continuing difficulties in winning the support of the Sephardim, Jews of Middle Eastern and North African origin. They make up 55 percent of the 2.1 million Israeli voters and will be crucial in determining the outcome of the Nov. 1 elections. In 1984, 70 percent of the Sephardim voted for the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, and this time, `` there is still a strong element of identification with the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>,'' said a pollster for the Labor-affiliated Decima polling company, speaking on condition of anonymity. However, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> pollsters said they expected a dip of about 5 percent in Sephardic support for <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, providing an opening for Labor to campaign aggressively among Sephardic voters. A key target group are young, financially successful Sephardim born in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> who make up about half of the 5 percent of the voters wavering between Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> Decima </LOCATION> pollster. They might determine the election because polls show Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> running neck-to-neck. Sephardic voting power first became evident in 1977 when Labor was ousted from the government after 29 years because Sephardim voted for the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> in massive numbers. The Sephardic identification with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> has its roots in the 1950s and 1960s when Labor, at the time dominated by Western-born Ashkenazim, often was arrogant toward the North African newcomers. Today, most Sephardim still feel greater affinity toward Likud than Labor, but after 11 years of the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> government, some supporters are becoming more critical. `` I will vote for the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> again, but it's not what it used to be in the times of -LRB- former <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> Prime Minister Menahem -RRB- Begin,'' said <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, 36, a taxi driver in <LOCATION> Ramle </LOCATION> where 70 percent of the votes traditionally go to <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. `` Labor was in the government for 30 years, and became corrupt. Now the same thing is happening to the Likud,'' he added. `` Likud can no longer say ` the Sephardim belong to us,''' said his colleague, <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarfati </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> voter who is now leaning toward Labor. Political analyst <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Elazar </PERSON> warned that the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> might be overestimating its hold on Sephardic voters. `` The Likud is convinced they have the Sephardim in their back pocket. I do n't think they do,'' said <PERSON> Elazar </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>, a think tank. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> had been better at governing and had not been associated with inflation and the war in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, their position with the Sephardim would have been unassailable,'' he added. Labor officials say they are making inroads, mainly because <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> candidates for the 120-member <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> includes 16 Sephardim. In addition, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, currently the foreign minister, is making many campaign appearances in predominantly Sephardic areas. But <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, who as deputy prime minister is the highest-ranking Sephardi in the Cabinet, played down the importance of the ethnic vote. `` Forty years have passed. Time has come to do away with the labels of Sephardim and Ashkenazim and to relate to people as <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> citizens,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. During a tour of <LOCATION> Ramle </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> was greeted by more than 100 school children, many of them chanting the party's slogan: `` Only Likud Can.'' <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Odelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Karmon </PERSON> denied Labor claims that Sephardic support for the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> was weakening, but said <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> leaders are not targeting thos voters in particular. `` Labor has to do that because of the past, but we have nothing to apologize for,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 CBS' saga about <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> finished among last week's top 15 prime-time TV shows and nearly matched the rating of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s version broadcast the previous week. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Liberace'' had a rating of 16.8 and ranked seventh. It was the `` official'' version, sanctioned by the flamboyant entertainer's estate. Perhaps viewers tuned in for CBS' `` Liberace: Behind the Music,'' hoping for a more sensationalized account of his life. The CBS movie had a rating of 16.6 and ranked 14th, according to the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won a week it had expected to lose because of major league baseball championship playoffs on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> A rainout of Friday's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> game 3 lowered <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s score in the Nielsens and gave <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> the unexpected victory For the week that ended Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had a 15.0 rating, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 13.4 and CBS 12.4. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> added two new shows to the top 10, its premiere of `` Empty Nest,'' nestled behind the hit `` Golden Girls'' on Saturday, and a preview of `` Dear John'' in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> Thursday hit lineup. The season premiere of `` The Cosby Show'' was No. 1, though it had a considerably lower rating and share than its premiere last season _ 24.2 and a 40 share, compared with 31.5 and 51 last year. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for research projects, attributed the `` Cosby'' number to competition from baseball, but said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had expected the show's ratings to slide in this, its fifth season. The rest of last week's top 10 were: `` A Different World,'' `` Golden Girls,'' `` Empty Nest'' and `` Dear <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' all <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>,'' a CBS Tuesday movie; and tied at eighth: `` ALF,'' `` Tonight Show 26th Anniversary'' and `` The <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> Family'' on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, plus CBS' `` 60 Minutes'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Monday Night Football.'' In news, the `` CBS Evening News'' won the week with a 10.2 rating and 20 share, though <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' managed a close second, 9.9 and 21, despite baseball pre-emptions. `` NBC Nightly News'' had a 9.6 and 20 share. A rating point equals 904,000 homes with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s Olympics coverage sputtered to a close with the `` Summer Olympics Review'' ranked 47th with an 8.7 rating and 14 share, just above the 10 lowest-rated shows of the week: `` Incredible Sunday,'' `` American League Championship Pre-game 3,'' `` National League Championship Pre-game 3,'' `` Full House,'' `` Bugs Bunny Specials,'' `` Cavanaughs,'' `` Perfect Strangers,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'' and `` Live! <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> Presents.''

 A prosecution witness at the divorce-fixing trial of former Miss America <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> conceded Tuesday that both sides in her boyfriend's divorce case did favors for the presiding judge's daughter. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, 64, the former city cultural affairs commissioner, is accused of giving a city job to the daughter of former state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Hortense </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, 75, in exchange for the judge's favorable rulings in the divorce of Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s lover, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` Andy'' <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>, 43. The defense succeeded in getting Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s former law clerk, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON>, to admit during cross examination that a lawyer for <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s wife once helped secure an apartment for Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s daughter, although he did not remember exactly when In earlier testimony, <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> made numerous phone calls to the judge's chambers while Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> was deciding whether to cut <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s alimony payments to his estranged wife. According to <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> apparently did not tell lawyers in the <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> divorce trial about the <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> phone calls when she offered to excuse herself from the case after a newspaper article revealed that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> had hired the judge's daughter, <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> is accused of giving a $ 19,000-a-year city job to <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, who was then 34, shortly after <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> became cultural affairs commissioner in 1983 in order to get the judge to reduce <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s temporary support payments. Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> also did not tell the lawyers that Mrs. <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Felder </PERSON>, helped <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> obtain an apartment, <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON> testified under questioning by the judge's defense attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Felder </PERSON> is not accused of any wrongdoing. In cross examining <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON>, the defense sought to explain or defuse his apparently damaging testimony that Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> deviated from her usual routine in handling the <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> case. On Sept. 14, 1983, Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> cut <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s weekly temporary alimony and child support payments from $ 1,850 to $ 680 a week. Her ruling came just a few weeks after <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> got a job as Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s assistant.

<HEAD>Power Company Seeks To Offset Pollution By Helping Grow Trees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In a gesture cheered by environmentalists, the operator of a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> power plant has agreed to chip in on a tree-growing project it says will indirectly offset its boilers' addition to the `` greenhouse'' warming of the Earth The company, <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday it will give $ 2 million to an international effort to plant 52 million trees on 385 square miles in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. The trees should absorb enough carbon dioxide to offset the 1.4 million tons that the company's 180-megawatt coal-fired plant in <LOCATION> Uncasville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, will generate each year during its 40-year life, according to the company's calculations. The <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, Va.-based company said that as an environmental rule of thumb, two square miles of forest are needed for every megawatt of coal-fired plant capacity. Environmentalists hailed the company's move, saying it helped illustrate the international nature of the greenhouse effect, a warming of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> that scientists say appears to have begun due to increasing carbon dioxide and other chemicals released into the air. Carbon dioxide is formed by fossil fuel combust ion. The warming could mean an average temperature increase of 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit by the middle of the next century, an increase in sea levels of a foot or more and widespread weather changes that could mean more frequent droughts in the center of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, scientists say. Worldwide, some 20 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year are released into the atmosphere. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Speth </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> that helped organize the <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> project, called the Applied Energy action `` one of the most far-sighted and socially responsible decisions that any company has ever made.'' Requiring plant operators to offset their emissions in some similar manner `` might be proposed someday'' in legislation, he said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON>, atmospheric physicist with the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said a colleague, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudek </PERSON>, had recently proposed payments from utilities to plant trees on land taken out of agricultural production in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Other environmentalists were quick to praise the Applied Energy decision. `` I like it,'' said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which is planning a tree-planting campaign of its own. `` It recognizes we're in one world, when you've got a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> company going to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> to plant trees.'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Sant </PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, said he hoped the project would prove `` a useful mitigation strategy'' for all new coal-fired electric generation capacity. `` We do n't yet know that this is going to work perfectly,'' but if it does `` we're looking to follow the same strategy at our other plants,'' <PERSON> Sant </PERSON> said. Applied Energy is one of the new independent producers selling power under contract to utilities, escaping tight state regulation for generally looser federal supervision. The company operates three plants totaling 360 megawatts and has contracts to build 1,600 megawatts of generating capacity. When the <LOCATION> Uncasville </LOCATION> plant is completed, it will sell power to <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Applied Energy's cash for the <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> project will be matched by cash or services totaling $ 2 million from CARE, $ 1.2 million from the government of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, $ 3.6 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> and $ 7.5 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. CARE, an international development organization based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, will handle the company's contribution.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is expressing strong support for the efforts of former <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> to achieve national reconciliation in his homeland and says `` effective safeguards'' must be imposed to prevent a return to power by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, who was meeting today with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, said Tuesday after a visit with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> he agrees that leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> `` must go into exile, if possible,'' as part of a post-settlement coalition government. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> are believed to have killed between 1 million and 2 million Cambodians during their 3 -LCB- years in power during the late 1970s. They are one of three rebel groups fighting the Vietnamese-backed government now in power in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is providing $ 5 million in non-lethal assistance to the two anti-communist rebel groups and is consulting with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the possibility of an increase. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> that he `` supported -LRB- <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s -RRB- efforts to establish a reconciliation government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' `` He said our policy rests on two elements, a complete Vietnamese withdrawal and no return to power of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which has been a major backer of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, recognizes that `` discredited'' leaders of that group, such as <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, can not be permitted to play a role in a future Cambodian government. But she said the administration could not confirm a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> report that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has offered political asylum to individual <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> leaders. There have been intensified diplomatic efforts to shape events in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has begun a drawdown of its troops in that country, setting a 1990 deadline for a complete withdrawal. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, who was ousted as head of state in 1970 and heads a rebel faction active in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, met with Undersecretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> after his visit to the White House. Aligning himself with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> told reporters it is `` necessary to give the world some guarantee about the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in the future.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the discussion with <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> focused on ways to achieve a negotiated settlement that includes the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and effective safeguards against a <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> return to power. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is said to be the strongest of the three factions and a major international effort is under way to ensure that group does not play a dominant role in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s future political evolution. Particularly active in this effort have been the six members of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>. One of the measures being discussed to limit the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> role is the establishment of an international peacekeeping force. Other measures under discussion include the disarming of all Cambodian factions and removing leading <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> figures from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> gave a strong endorsement of <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, calling him a `` leading symbol of Cambodian nationalism for the past 40 years.'' `` We believe that his role is central to a satisfactory settlement in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and we welcome the opportunity of his visit to express our strong support for him,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 Ancient alchemists, who strived to convert base metals into gold, have been outdone. A modern-day chemist is changing sewer gas into diamonds. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and his colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> wo n't likely be going into the fancy jewelry business, he admits. But they have found a way to produce some tiny industrial-type diamond crystals using one of the most widely available raw materials, the methane from sewer gas. In this case, gas from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plains </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, which is adjacent to the research laboratory. In addition, other chemists working at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> have grown diamond crystals using an oxygen-acetylene torch, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think we'll be able to grow gemstone size and quality diamonds in the near future,'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> cautioned. But the tiny diamonds made in his process _ using chemical vapors to deposit crystals on a surface _ could have a variety of industrial applications from abrasives to protective coatings, computer insulators and a host of other uses, he said. What <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and the other <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> scientists are doing is developing methods of getting carbon to form diamond crystals. Their process requires heating chemical vapors at normal air pressure or less and then getting carbon from the vapor to crystalize on a surface at temperatures of about 900 degrees Celsius -LRB- 1,440 degrees Fahrenheit -RRB-. Current industrial processes for making diamonds require much higher heat and pressure. Graphite _ the soft black material used in pencil leads _ is the normally stable form of carbon at room temperature, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> explained. But by heating carbon-containing gases like sewer gas or acetylene the harder form of carbon can be made to grow on a surface. And if enough crystals form they combine into a thin diamond film, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> added. Why use sewer gas? `` Sewer gas was just a case of having a convenient, inexpensive source of methane,'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. Methane, a combination of carbon and hydrogen, is a primary constituent of sewer gas. It is generally burned as waste. Researchers in other countries have performed some similar experiments, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said, adding that such sources of carbon as vodka also have been used. It will be years before the diamond-making system could be developed on an industrial scale, he said, but when that happens plenty of raw material will be available. And if burning of the waste gas is halted that also would reduce pollution and release of carbon dioxide, a product of the burning which scientsts fear will add to the so-called greenhouse warming of the Earth.

<HEAD>Meetings This Week on US-Soviet Grain Pact</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Another meeting is scheduled for this week in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to see if a new long-term U.S.-Soviet grain agreement can be worked out. The meeting was announced Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as `` tentatively scheduled'' for Thursday and Friday, but no other details were provided in the brief statement by <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON>, deputy trade representative, who leads <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators. The previous 5-year agreement expired on Sept. 30, despite months of negotiations and informal talks by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet officials. One possibility has been a simple extension of the old pact for a year while negotiators work out details of a new arrangement. Negotiators have been pressured by some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm interests to insist on larger minimum levels of annual grain purchases by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, the Soviets have been buying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain in large quantities without a new agreement, including an additional 250,000 metric tons announced Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The sale brought total corn sold to the Soviets and delivered in the 1988-89 corn marketing year that began on Sept. 1 to more than 4.3 million tons. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 250,000 tons of corn would be about 9.85 million bushels. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.73 per bushel at the farm level, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimates, meaning that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $ 27 million. According to the old agreement, the annual purchases were supposed to include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The Soviets had the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent. Prior to the round of sales announced since Sept. 1, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had purchased 9.05 million tons of wheat and 5.17 million tons of corn for delivery in the fifth year and final year of the agreement, plus 830,000 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

 Last weekend's meat loaf might still taste good tonight with the addition of a substance from the shells of crabs and lobsters, according to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> scientists. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vercelloti </PERSON>, a chemist at the department's <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, said the substance, called chitin, inhibits a warmed-over flavor in uncured meat, poultry or fish that is cooked, stored and reheated. The additives have shown in laboratory tests to inhibit the off-taste for up to five days when mixed with hamburger, he said. <PERSON> Vercellotti </PERSON>, in a report issued Tuesday by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said TV dinners, microwave foods and leftovers are prime candidates for off-tastes Meats cured with nitrite, such as bacon, ham and lunch meats do n't have such problems, he said. The warmed-over flavor also is described by the food industry as `` cardboardy'' or `` painty.'' The off-taste is caused when fat in the uncured meat breaks down as it is reheated. <PERSON> Vercellotti </PERSON> and a fellow chemist, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>, are seeking a patent on additives made from chitin, which he described as `` a surplus material from the shellfish industry.'' Chitin is most commonly found in the shells of lobsters, crabs and other shellfish. The warmed-over flavor occurs when oxygen in the atmosphere breaks down fats in the meat, the report said. Large amounts of iron present in meat speed up the oxidation. But the chitin additives bind the iron so it can not speed up the oxidation, thus slowing down the development of the warmed-over flavor. Chitin additives would have to be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> before being available to consumers. `` Basically they are a type of soluble dietary fiber that we think will be safe to use in foods,'' <PERSON> Vercellotti </PERSON> said. `` We've only tested chitin additives on beef, but we think they will work on other meats, poultry and fish as well. The laboratory studies show that the additives `` have no other effect on meat flavor,'' he said. `` We're only talking about adding a few parts per million to the meat.'' <PERSON> Vercellotti </PERSON> said the compounds can be mixed into the meat, rolled on to the meat surface or sprayed on as a liquid.

<HEAD>Labor Costs In Europe Now Higher Than In US</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The labor-cost advantage that West European factory owners held over their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> counterparts as recently as two years ago is shrinking, according to a government report. A <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> report Tuesday said labor costs measured in dollar terms were higher in eight West European countries in 1987 than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The average hourly cost in this country was $ 13.44 last year. In <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> it was $ 17.39, in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> $ 17.14; in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> $ 16.87; in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> $ 15.46; in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> $ 15.12; in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> $ 15.02; in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> $ 14.56 and in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> $ 13.52. For the first time since 1980, the West European average was higher than that of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In 1986, the only <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries that paid more for their labor than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The lower cost of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> labor was due in large part to the drop in the value of the dollar compared with most other currencies. The labor costs as measured by the bureau included employer-paid taxes such as social security payments, as well as spending on private benefit plans and the actual money that employees find in their pay envelopes. Since labor costs often determine where a manufacturer will produce goods and what the price will be, lower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> labor costs help make American goods cheaper and more attractive on world markets. The bureau survey measured labor costs in 26 countries around the globe. The average for those countries was 76 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pay rate. That was 10 percentage points higher than in 1986 and 6 points above the previous peak in 1980 when the dollar was at a low point. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> accounted for a good deal of the overall rise in labor costs. In 1975 its labor cost was $ 3.05 an hour, less than half the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rate. In 1986 it was $ 9.47. In 1987 it was $ 11.14, well above <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s $ 8.96, close to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s $ 11.97 and 83 percent of the cost in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been losing some of its own manufacturing to the `` tigers,'' the rapidly industrializing countries of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, where costs are still low though they have been rising even faster than in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. South Korean factories still had to spend only $ 1.79 an hour last year, but that was a big jump from 35 cents in 1975. Labor costs in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are lower. In <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> they were only $ 1.49 an hour, a drop from the $ 1.60 of 1986. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> they were $ 1.57, less than half the $ 3.71 rate of 1981, when the Mexican peso was worth a lot more than it is today.

<HEAD>Lawyers: North Didn't Know Lying to Congress Was a Crime</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Defense lawyers say <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> can not be prosecuted for lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because the former presidential aide was never warned that making misleading statements about covert operations was a crime. Citing false statements by government officials about other covert operations, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense lawyers contended Tuesday that Iran-Contra prosecutors were bringing novel charges against their client. The defense said that until <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s indictment March 16 with three other Iran-Contra defendants, `` no executive branch official had ever been prosecuted based on unsworn statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' North did not receive a `` fair warning that an executive branch official or a member of his staff would be guilty of a crime if the truth were misstated in an unsworn communication to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' the defense said. The defense filed a series of motions to dismiss various charges that <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide, misled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committees in 1985 and 1986 by denying involvement in efforts to arm the Contras or raise money for the rebels fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government The defense noted that none of the statements made by <PERSON> North </PERSON> were under oath, including remarks he made during an `` informal off-the-record discussion'' with members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 in the White House Situation Room. The other statements were written responses to queries made by various <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committees about reports of covert assistance to the Nicaraguan rebels. An indictment returned last March charges <PERSON> North </PERSON>, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> with conspiring to defraud the government by diverting U.S.-Iran arms sale profits to the Contras. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has ordered separate trials for each defendant. North is set to be tried first, but no date has been set for the trial. North's lawyers noted there was no prosecution of Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Dulles </PERSON> for falsely assuring lawmakers in 1958 that the government was not intervening in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> even though the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> was supporting rebels fighting President <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON>. Likewise, the defense said, there were no prosecutions arising from false statements by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> after a U-2 spy plane was shot down over the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1960, the defense noted. There may be disagreement `` as to whether or to what extent it is proper for government officials to misstate or conceal the truth where a truthful statement would jeopardize intelligence gathering or covert operations or otherwise compromise national security,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers said. `` Until this case, however, there was no notion that such a false or misleading statement could be criminal simply because the statement was made directly or indirectly to a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' the defense said. `` The executive branch communicates with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a continual basis about countless matters relating to the business of government,'' the defense said. North's lawyers said the provision under which he was charged only applied to statements made in connection with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' administrative functions and `` could not have been intended to reach such communications. If it were applicable, `` it would allow prosecution of executive branch officials for misrepresenting their intentions or concealing material facts,'' defense lawyers said.

 A demonstration that temporarily closed <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> headquarters underscores the desperation of AIDS sufferers hoping for a chemical cure that so far has escaped researchers around the world. The action Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters building in nearby <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, also highlighted a fundamental problem facing the agency charged by law with overseeing the safety and effectiveness of its drugs. In essence, the hundreds of demonstrators _ including more than 100 arrested for blocking entrances to the building _ are asking the agency to recommend experimental AIDS treatments as soon as it determines they are no more dangerous than AIDS itself. The agency says that to do that would eliminate a major reason for its existence: to apply a scientific sorting process that tries to cull quackery from treatments proven safe and effective. The key word is proven. AIDS patients feel they do n't have time to wait for proof. `` I would rather take my chances with the side effects of an experimental drug,'' said <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Russo </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> writer who says he was diagnosed with AIDS in 1985. `` The side effect of AIDS is death.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Russo </PERSON> complained that officials in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration are using the highly vocal call for easier approval of AIDS drugs to bolster its general theme of less government regulation _ in this case of pharmaceutical companies. <PERSON> Russo </PERSON> said he and his fellow demonstrators do not want the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to stop testing drugs. They want the agency to test them faster. Ironically, that argument was heard loudest from pharmaceutical companies until the issue of AIDS drugs attained such a high profile. But such an argument coming from an individual suffering from an incurable illness casts the issue onto a moral and ethical plane _ and, on Tuesday, into the streets. There is an inherent ethical judgment in almost all FDA decisions on new drugs: whether the beneficial effect warrants potentially harmful side effects. But the issue is seldom drawn sharply enough to provoke protests by the people most directly affected _ the patients. With no easy answers in sight, the private <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> publishes an AIDS experimental treatment directory that is updated quarterly. The latest edition, issued just over three weeks ago, lists 97 drugs and agents being investigated as possible treatments for AIDS and AIDS-related illnesses with the names and addresses of the researchers conducting trials on each. The 128-page book _ free to AIDS patients _ starts with the `` strong recommendation'' that any person considering experimental treatment `` obtain the guidance of a personal physician in making any and all decisions in this area.'' In a note to those infected with HIV _ the AIDS-causing virus _ the booklet recommends reading established medical journals that report on AIDS research. `` But do not be fooled into thinking you can be your own doctor after reading a selection of articles,'' it cautions. The booklet's last advice says that while `` there is no such thing as the Official Guide to Coping with Serious Illness ... there is something very real that is known as ` the will to live.' It can not be found in a test-tube or under a microscope. Every person must discover it for himself. If you have it or can find it, it can make a difference.'' <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Russo </PERSON> has been living with AIDS for more than three years, longer than most who contract the disease. He is determined to live. And when all else is said and done, whether their position is right or wrong, that is why <PERSON> Russo </PERSON> and hundreds of fellow demonstrators shut the doors of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> for a few hours on a chilly October day.

 Negotiators are trying to reach a compromise on sharply differing tax bills passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, one containing a `` taxpayers' bill of rights'' and the other offering relief for 20 million owners of mutual funds. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, which was approved Tuesday night on an 87-1 vote, would cut selected taxes by an estimated $ 3 billion over three years and, to avoid worsening the deficit, boost other taxes by the same amount. The House bill, passed 380-25 on Aug. 4, has a $ 7.5 billion price tag. Far more provisions are identical in both bills. Both would correct hundreds of technical errors in the 1986 tax overhaul; extend several expiring tax benefits; relieve farmers from paying the federal diesel tax on fuel for off-road use, and raise some taxes to pay for the benefits. The tax bill and a comprehensive plan for fighting drug abuse are the only major pieces of legislation standing in the way of adjournment of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, as early as this weekend. `` All of us realize the more revenue we have in this bill, the less likely the president is to sign it,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> tax measure Thus, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will try to hold down the cost and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators will be pushing for senators to accept some new provisions. Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, cast the only vote against the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill. A principal architect of the 1986 tax changes, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> has argued against undue tampering with the new system, saying it should not be riddled with special-interest provisions. Not voting on the 87-1 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote that passed the tax bill were: Sens. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>,; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash.; <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, R-Neb; <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind.; <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills would extend several expiring tax benefits, with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opting for a shorter extension in order to reduce the cost. These include a credit for business research, an exclusion for workers' employer-financed educational assistance, and a tax break for low-income first-time home buyers. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, but not the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, would set up a `` bill of rights'' for taxpayers who are the subject of collection or other enforcement efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. The agency would have to inform taxpayers fully of their rights at the time an action is launched and would be barred from promoting employees on the basis of how much they collect. The 10-day notice required before the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> could seize property for overdue taxes would be extended to 30 days. The House bill includes a permanent change for owners of mutual-fund shares, allowing them to deduct as a miscellaneous expense certain costs of operating the funds. These expenses could be written off fully despite a 1986 change that permits miscellaneous deductions only to the extent they exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income. Other Senate provisions would:

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is opting to ship deadly plutonium for its nuclear reactors by sea rather than by air, prompting complaints from some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should have been consulted. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese officials disclosed the shipping plans on Tuesday, touching off the dispute. Two Democratic lawmakers said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was tricked out of its right to a reasonable period to review changes in the new 30-year U.S.-Japan nuclear cooperation agreement. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> denied the assertion, saying the new pact, which went into effect last July, allowed certain changes with 15 days' notice to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The change provides for a temporary alternative of sea shipment until crash-proof air shipment casks are developed. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> told reporters that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was notified formally on Sept. 20. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been purchasing spent uranium atomic fuel from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and sending it to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for refining into plutonium before it reaches <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seeks to retain control over usage because plutonium is highly radioactive and usable not only for fueling power reactors but also for nuclear weapons. In authorizing ocean shipments to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the latest arrangement requires that armed escorts be provided against potential terrorist seizure. It defines the escort `` as a coast guard or maritime safety vessel or any other ship on government service that is authorized and fully capable of protecting the transport ship and cargo and deterring acts of sabotage,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stratford </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of state for nuclear energy and technology. He said the Japanese were told they could request <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> escorts but that they would be supplied only if consistent with overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security priorities. The Japanese then `` indicated they were considering providing the escort themselves,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held a 49-43 lead over <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in a national survey of registered voters conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which also found equal numbers of respondents calling themselves Republicans and Democrats. The organization polled 1,007 registered voters Friday through Sunday. Because of a four-point margin of error, the two presidential candidates were statistically tied. Other national polls also have found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> retaining a small numerical lead, indicating that he is slightly ahead. Most other recent polls have been conducted among registered voters who are judged as likely to turn out. Gallup, applying a relatively loose gauge of likely voters, found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading by 52-41 in that group of 748. Gallup stressed the closer result in its analysis of the survey, released Tuesday, saying it believed it was too soon to gauge likelihood of voting. That bigger <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lead could stem from his greater support among better educated voters, who generally are more likely to vote. He was backed by 58 percent of college-educated respondents, compared with 37 percent of those who have not finished high school. Also, the Gallup poll found about as many respondents calling themselves Republicans as Democrats, a result matched in some but not all other polls. In past years, the Democrats have held a clear edge. As in other polls, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, was seen as having decisively beaten his Republican counterpart, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, in their debate last week. Just less than half rated <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as qualified to serve as president if necessary, but that was up from about a third before the debate. Seventy-six percent called <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> qualified, up from 68 percent. Gallup sought to ascertain the effect of doubts about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> by isolating the respondents who saw no difference between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> but did see a difference between <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. They made up 9 percent of the total, were mostly Democratic and went for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by a 2-1 margin.

 When <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> picked up an AR-15 assault rifle at a police practice range in eastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and brought the weapon to his shoulder, he was aiming all the same for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> votes. The Democratic vice presidential candidate's three shots Tuesday hit just below the silhouette target's heart. Democrats in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> are hoping that on Nov. 8 he can hit an electoral bull's eye. After weeks of taking a drubbing, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s strong showing against <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in their debate has sparked new optimism and a new offensive by the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrats. `` It was viewed as a slam dunk in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and there's obviously a lot of regional pride,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s chief of staff. `` The mentality of the political guys down in the state has changed dramatically over the past week.'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s top campaign aide, seems to spend as much time in touch with the senator's <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> organization as he does with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> campaign's <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> headquarters. After all, winning <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' 29 electoral votes _ third largest prize in the nation _ was the main reason <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was picked for the ballot by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. And he's turned what was expected to be a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> blowout into a horserace. But so far the polls show he's not winning it. Published surveys put the Democrats behind by five to 12 points. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON>, director of the Dukakis-Bentsen <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> campaign, says the Democrats' post-debate polling showed the gap near the small end of that range, while Republicans privately say their data still show a double-digit lead for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and strong anti-Dukakis sentiment. `` We feel good,'' says <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Basher </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> campaign. Not only are the polls in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s favor, he says, but the Republicans have a strong organization in the state that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also calls home. The task for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> clearly is to convince Texans that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be good for their economy and trustworthy on gut issues such as crime and gun control _ issues the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has used to clobber the Democrats. After he picked up that rifle at the police academy in <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> spoke on how the Democrats were tough on crime, despite <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> claims to the contrary. The image of the vice presidential candidate so armed delivered the other message: If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is some kind of anti-gun nut, as the the Republicans make him out to be, would he have a man on the ticket like <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> who owns many firearms and uses them with expert flair? The campaign is complementing its symbolism with an aggressive new advertising campaign in the state. `` We've just begun to launch our attack, when <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> voters are paying attention,'' said <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON>, a non-Texan who refuses to accept criticism from state Democrats, including <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, that the campaign did n't respond quickly enough to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> onslaught. `` We're a patient campaign,'' <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON> said this week. `` This is Monday, Oct. 10, not Monday, Nov. 7,'' he said this week. On the heels of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s debate, Democrats in the past week have launched a new television and radio blitz. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for a prison furlough program and favoring gun control, the ads say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has supported the same things. A direct mail campaign lampoons <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visits to flag factories. It features flags of other nations that are doing well under a Republican administration _ such as drug-exporting countries, the Iranians who traded hostages for arms, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, with its trade dominance of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has maintained his home state popularity despite being tied to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who is more liberal than most <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> politicians. Trying to rub some of that approval off on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> flew to Lone Star, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the day after his <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> debate for a joint rally with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and he'll be there this week to watch on television as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> debates <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. And he'll be back.

 <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> is a 2-year-old with a new pair of shoes. Nothing unusual about that, except that <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> is a goose. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>, owned by <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> of <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, was born without feet and has legs that end in stumps just below the ankle. `` He had to balance himself like a child on stilts,'' <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said. Until recently, <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>'s legs were n't big enough to support shoes. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> bought leather shoes _ size 0 _ for <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>. Now, the goose can walk, run and swim. `` Those shoes gave him a whole new lease on life,'' <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said. `` Now he can outswim the other geese.'' <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said the idea for shoes came easily, but that keeping the shoes on a goose was another matter. He modified the shoes, putting foam rubber in the end for comfort and to keep them from turning around. He also had to glue the bows to the shoe because <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> kept untying the laces. Small holes in the bottom of each shoe allows water to drain so the leather wo n't freeze in winter. `` He just loves'em,'' <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said. `` He does n't try to kick them off any more.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Seeking Last-Minute Compromise On Iraq Sanctions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is seeking a last-minute compromise as it tries a final time to agree on a package of sanctions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for its alleged use of poison gas against Kurds. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators are considering a Senate-passed tax bill which includes the anti-Iraq provision. The bill is one of the final items on the congressional agenda before the legislators adjourn for the year. The sanctions package was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, 87-0, as an amendment Tuesday evening, shortly before the entire bill was passed, 87-1. It was third time in two months the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has voted on the issue, following reports that the Iraqi army used chemical arms in late August to put down Kurdish rebels. `` The world can not stand by in the face of repeated use of poison gas by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn. The measure, less sweeping than the sanctions package adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> a month ago, is similar to a plan already approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The bill would ban the export to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> munitions and some high technology items, and require <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to oppose loans to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> by international financial institutions such as the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would have to levy more sanctions by Dec. 31 unless <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> provides verifiable assurances that it wo n't against use chemical weapons Those potential sanctions include denial of export-import credits and downgrading diplomatic relations. But the bill would n't restrict grain exports or halt <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> attempts to get monetary credits to buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural products. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., reflecting the worries of farm state legislators, said, `` The concern is that this not lead to an embargo on agricultural exports to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. But Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., complained that the measure unfairly penalized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers `` They're probably laughing at us in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> right now,'' <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said, declaring that the bill would not cut off the export to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of the equipment and chemicals needed to produce such chemical weapons as mustard gas and nerve gas.

<TEXT>
 A 12-year-old boy is the 11th Israeli to contact polio since an outbreak began last month, and health officials said an inadequate sewer system was contributing to the spread of the disease. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> last week ordered a nationwide vaccination campaign after the polio virus was found in sewage in at least a dozen <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> cities. On Tuesday, the third day of the campaign, the government began vaccinating about 1 million school children against the paralyzing disease. Since September, there have been 11 confirmed cases of the disease and six suspected cases. But Health Ministry officials insisted the outbreak has not become an epidemic. `` We would n't be vaccinating the whole population if we did n't think the whole population could be at risk But this absolutely is not an epidemic,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Slater </PERSON>, chief epidemologist for the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. He said the latest case, the first confirmed since Sept. 12, was reported in the town of <LOCATION> Hadera </LOCATION>, about 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. The outbreak began in <LOCATION> Hadera </LOCATION> and most of the cases have been reported there. Doctors believe the boy contracted the disease from an infected person, not from contaminated sewage, <PERSON> Slater </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Morag </PERSON>, chairman of the ministry's committee on infectious diseases, said sewage has contributed to the spread of the virus in some parts of the country. The former head of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s sewage system, <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Meir </PERSON>, told Israeli radio that the nation's sewer system must be improved as soon as possible. `` We have to tell the truth, purification centers are not creating sterile surroundings,'' <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> said on the radio. `` But I'm against scaring the public and saying, like I heard a child say: ` When I drink water I drink polio.' In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, authorities closed two beaches amid fears that overflowing sewage could contaminate the water with the virus. A spokesman said no trace of the polio virus had been found in the water but city officials decided to close the beaches as a precaution. At vaccination centers across the country, school children received drops of the Sabin vaccine on their tongue. In some areas, nurses went to schools and administered the vaccines in classrooms. Ministry officials expect to finish vaccinating school children today and are now preparing doses of the vaccine for adults. More than 3 million people under the age of 40 will be vaccinated in the next three weeks at a cost of about $ 2.5 million.

 <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> has canceled plans to use chemical spraying against marijuana and coca plants because of a peasant protest, Justice Minister Guillermo Plazas Acid said. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dangerous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drugs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> had planned to spray 1,760 acres of marijuana and coca plants with the herbicide glyphosphate in southwest <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. About 2,000 peasants marched on the town of <LOCATION> Corinto </LOCATION>, took over the town and kidnapped a newspaper reporter and two television reporters last Saturday. The reporters, all Colombians, were released after a government commission arrived in <LOCATION> Corinto </LOCATION>, 190 miles southwest of the capital of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, to talk with the peasants. `` The plants will be destroyed by hand, without using chemical products,'' the justice minister said at a news conference Tuesday. The minister said in a response to a reporter's question that Colombian drug traffickers apparently had organized the peasant protest. A spokesman for the peasants said that the peasants grow marijuana and coca because drug traffickers loan them money for planting and buy the crops for cash. Government agencies will not loan money to peasants, the spokesman, <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, said in an interview published Tuesday by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s leading newspaper, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tiempo </LOCATION>, of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has used glyphosphate against marijuana plants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> concluded his final foreign trip of the year with an appeal to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to reject a secular future and look to its common religious heritage to guide it into the 21st century. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who completes a decade as pope this week, devoted the four-day trip in northeastern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to spreading his vision of a unified <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and shoring up the wilting <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on the continent where it first flowered. The pope got a sharp reminder of the divisions still plaguing European countries as he gave a speech Tuesday to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, his main address of the trip. Shortly after he began speaking to the packed chamber, a militant <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Protestant leader, the Rev. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, leapt to his feet and shouted, `` I renounce you! I renounce you as the anti-Christ!'' The pope paused and <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, an elected parliamentarian, was dragged from the hall. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> has led opposition to the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement which gave the government of Catholic-dominated <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> a say in the running of mostly Protestant <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. In addition to addressing the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which plays a consultative role to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> addressed the 21-member <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, all located in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> near the West German border. The pontiff focused on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s future at a time of heated debate on the subject. The planned integration of the 12 Common Market countries' economies in 1992 has given rise to discussion of a closer political union. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> drew criticism last month when she declared that a U.S.-style European unit would weaken individual cultures. The pope's statements sharply contrasted with <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s position `` A common political structure ... far from endangering the identity of the people of the Community, will be better suited to guarantee more fairly the rights ... of all regions,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> built on a theme of a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> extending `` from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the Urals,'' in which political institutions are subordinate to a common culture based on such `` Christian'' values as freedom of speech and conscience. He paid particular attention to what he viewed as a secular assault on the continent's `` Christian'' identity. `` It is my duty to stress vigorously that if the religious and Christian substratum of this continent should someday be marginalized in its role of inspiring ethics and in its social efficacy, it is not only all of the heritage of the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> past that would be denied but a future worthy of European man,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. In visits to the cities of <LOCATION> Metz </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Mulhouse </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> urged special attention to unemployment, the breakdown of the family and other problems that have followed <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s development into a wealthy, high-tech region. He expressed distress at the dwindling practice of Catholicism in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, especially <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where most people are Roman Catholics but less than 20 percent regularly attend Mass. The pope drew large crowds in services at stadiums and cathedrals, but few people seemed to line his routes through <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> and the misty countryside nearby. More than 10,000 police guarded the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s routes in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, many wearing dapper gray <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON> suits. With this trip, his last of the year, the 68-year-old pontiff has logged 40,000 miles this year and delivered 136 speeches in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s new premier, is a moderate with a managerial background and is expected to stand for cautious economic reform <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> will succeed <PERSON> Lubomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Strougal </PERSON>, who was widely regarded as <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s chief advocate of far-reaching changes in the sluggish economy but whose plans were watered down by party conservatives. At 62, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, a graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, is considered too old to honor recent official promises to rejuvenate the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government hierarchy. His main drawback is that for 18 years as deputy premier he worked in the political shadow of Premier <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Korcak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Strougal </PERSON>, who stepped down Monday. In his younger years, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> had no chance to develop charisma and establish himself as an obvious choice for more senior positions in the government. He replaced <PERSON> Korcak </PERSON> in a reshuffle in March 1987 when he was also promoted to the party's ruling Politburo. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> has long been known as a good orator who would pinpoint shortcomings in public, but some critics say that he has lost some of the impetus as a reform advocate. His main advantage appears to be that in the eyes of many Czechs he is not associated with the oppression that occurred during the so-called `` crisis years'' of 1968-69 when then-party chief <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> and his associates were purged in the wake of the Soviet-led invasion. At that time he was still at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, while heading the industrial department of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. According to Western analysts, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, who earlier had a reputation of a reformer, appears to have adopted a more cautious line but continues to criticize poor economic performance. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> wants modernization of industry by raising the technical standard of plants and equipment. In a speech to a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> session last December, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said, `` If we do not modernize the traditional engineering and non-engineering industries, the inherited technical creativity will gradually evaporate and that would cost us very dearly.'' He also complained about requesting from the Czech industry higher export performance without providing adequate funding for technical innovation and higher qualification of personnel. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> was born Sept. 10, 1926 to a miner's family in <LOCATION> Frenstat </LOCATION> pod Radhostem in north <LOCATION> Moravia </LOCATION>. In the 1945-55 period he worked in a rubber processing company, ending as a deputy director. He subsequently was employed by his hometown's electric company, where he became director in 1960. In 1960-62 he held local government jobs and in the 1963-69 period he headed <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> departments in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. He became a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in June 1966.

<HEAD>Finance Minister Among Those Who Bought Unlisted Stocks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Finance Minister was among leading political figures who bought unlisted stocks in a series of questionable equitities purchases, the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Communist Party has alleged. Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> was among those who purchased shares of a real estate firm before they were offered publicly, and later sold them for a huge profit, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Vice Chariman <PERSON> Koichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueda </PERSON> said at a news conference Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said it obtained documents allegedly showing the purchases by <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> and senior private secretaries of other leading politicians including Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and former Premier <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>. Political secretaries in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are similar to Western politicians' chiefs of staff and are politicians' closest aides. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> and other political leaders have acknowledged their aides were involved in the purchases but have said they did not know about them at the time. The Communist Party's allegations were the first against <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> bought 10,000 shares of the real estate firm <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for the equivalent of $ 195,000 in September 1986, a month before the shares were listed publicly. <PERSON> Ueda </PERSON> said <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> made a profit of at least $ 130,000 since he bought the shares at $ 19.50 each and they rose to more than $ 32.50 each when listed. In Western equities markets such transactions constitute insider trading, or trading on privileged information, and are illegal. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> only has vague regulations concerning use of confidential information in transactions, and companies are free to offer shares to whomever they wish at any price. The government has moved to tighten Japanese laws against insider trading but the action is not retroactive. <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>'s secretary, <PERSON> Nobuyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakatsu </PERSON>, said by telephone that no comment from <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> would be available. But <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> told Japanese reporters at a hastily called news conference that he allowed former secretary <PERSON> Tsuneo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hattori </PERSON> to use his name, `` but as I repeated again and again, I myself am not involved in any dealings. I am, rather, a victim.'' Asked if the shares were bought under his or <PERSON> Hattori </PERSON>'s name, <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> said he did not know. <PERSON> Hattori </PERSON> resigned last week, saying he wanted to make way for younger people. One of the documents obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, widely reproduced in newspapers and on television, shows the names of nine reputed share purchasers, including <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> and the aides to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>. Do <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a stock trading firm, acquired 80,000 shares of Recruit-Cosmos and turned them over to the nine for $ 19.50 a share a month before the shares went on sale, according to the document. Another Communist Party official who would not be identified said the party received the documents anonymously but determined they were genuine. The charges against <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> apparently had little effect on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION>, which a dealer said was slowed more by the sharp fall of the dollar against the yen. The so-called Recruit scandal unfolded in July as a bribery case in <LOCATION> Kawasaki </LOCATION>, a city south of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, but spread to encompass some of the country's most powerful politicians or their aides as well as senior journalists and at least one professor. Experts say the practice of selling stocks at low prices to politicians has been common, with companies making political contributions in this way.

 <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has rejected a possible January visit by <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> to inaugurate a Latin American cultural center. It would have been the first since the two countries reestablished diplomatic relations in 1986 after a 22 year break.

<TEXT>
 Once again, there's talk of high stakes as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> get ready for their second and last debate of the 1988 presidential campaign. Maybe this will be the breakthrough debate, the occasion when one or the other will so impress voters with his eloquence or ineptitude that the election will be decided then and there. More likely it will be an October rerun of their September debate. A few new lines have appeared in the campaign weeks following that debate. Look for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to hold up a $ 20 bill and deride <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for a $ 1,000-a-year tax deferred savings account Thursday night `` Twenty bucks,'' he tells roaring partisan audiences. `` Twenty bucks.'' That, he says, is the annual tax savings Americans would realize from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan. Crime has been a major stump theme for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in recent days, with renewed attacks on the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison furlough program. What might voters remember of their first confrontation, the debate that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> likes to refer to as `` some of the best 90 minutes of this whole campaign''? They might recall <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stirring defense of his running mate, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` He took a tremendous pounding,'' said the vice president `` and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would do `` very, very well. And he has my full confidence and he'll have the confidence of people in their 30s and 40s.'' The Republican nominee predicted his running mate would do `` very well when we get into the debates.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has since had his debate with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator came across as overly programmed and the polls showed that he fell short of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s expectations. Will <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rise to the defense of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> again? That should be one moment to watch for on Thursday night. That first presidential debate also was the night that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gave a passionless response to a question about his lack of passion, about the characterization that he is `` the smartest clerk in the world.'' `` I care deeply about people,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He said it again and again. `` I am somebody who believes deeply ... I care very deeply ... These are things I believe in very, very deeply.'' He conceded that `` I may be a little calmer than some about it.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did show a passion for certain words. He used `` lead,'' `` leader,'' and `` leadership'' 18 times during the debate. He also was partial toward `` values'' and `` strength.'' When the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was asked about his lack of foreign policy experience, he gave this reply: `` The question is values, the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided. I'm ready to provide that leadership. I want to be the commander-in-chief of this country. I think it takes fresh leadership now and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need. ... I do n't think it's just experience that makes a difference It's strength. It's values. Twelve times, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> referred to `` values.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was n't far behind, using the word 11 times _ six times in his first response. `` Liberal'' and `` liberals'' were <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> favorites; he used one or the other eight times. He also used several other terms which mean the same thing, like `` ACLU,'' `` freeze people,'' a reference to supporters of a nuclear freeze and such geographic symbols of liberalism as `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>'' and with something of a sneer, `` <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'' and `` Bostonians.''

Communications Minister <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Viera </PERSON> said in July that <PERSON> Aguinada </PERSON> had held a high, but unspecified post in the guerrilla hierarchy. <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> officials denied it, saying <PERSON> Aguinada </PERSON>'s work was on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the political organization allied with the rebel combatants. <PERSON> Aguinada </PERSON> told about 200 supporters at the airport: `` I greet you again in this country of ours, for which thousands have offered their blood and their lives in the struggle for liberation.'' About 65,000 people have been killed in the war, most of them civilians. A military communique said Tuesday that troops raided a guerrilla camp in northeastern <LOCATION> Cabanas </LOCATION> province, killing two rebels and wounding five. The army also said a soldier was wounded in one of numerous harassment attacks Monday on army positions in different parts of the country. Rebels also destroyed six utility poles in their continuing campaign to sabotage electrical installations, the statement said. The guerrillas on Tuesday celebrated the eighth anniversary of the founding of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the organization of five guerrilla armies fighting to overthrow the government. `` We have carried the war to the cities and the rearguard of the enemy,'' the rebels said on their clandestine Radio Venceremos. `` Our objective is to construct a new and sovereign country, where the campesino can be the owner of the land he works, where men have equality,'' Cmdr. <PERSON> Ferman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cienfuegos </PERSON> said in the broadcast.

<HEAD>Killing Of Australian Yachtsman Sparks Diplomatic Row</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The shooting death of an Australian yachtsman by <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> police has caused a major diplomatic row between the two countries, with Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> rejecting <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> explanations. The <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> government called the Aug. 14 killing of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blenkinsop </PERSON> an accident, but <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> on Tuesday demanded a full inquiry into the `` dastardly event. `` We are not going to have a situation where Australian nationals can be pushed around, in this case killed, and just sit quietly back,'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said. `` We will pursue this matter to see that it is properly investigated.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Indonesian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION> said police boarded the couple's yacht and <PERSON> Blenkinsop </PERSON> and his pregnant British-born fiancee, <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Mist </PERSON>, were shot accidentally during a struggle. The embassy said the yachtsman drowned after falling overboard. Ms. Mist says <PERSON> Blenkinsop </PERSON> was shot twice and thrown overboard. Her baby was not injured. `` Certainly the late Mr. <PERSON> Blenkinsop </PERSON>'s fiancee has a quite different story and I must say that I'm not prepared to accept at face value some story on the part of <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> authorities about an accident,'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Blenkinsop </PERSON>'s parents said they spent $ 6,400 to search for their son's body. Frustrated at the lack of information, they finally wrote to <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thaufick </PERSON> <PERSON> Salim </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Indonesian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Blenkinsop </PERSON> and his fiancee entered <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> waters during a voyage from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> two months ago, to seek shelter from rough weather and refuel. They landed on the island of <LOCATION> Serui </LOCATION> where their yacht was boarded by police, who asked them to sail to the island of <LOCATION> Biak </LOCATION> for immigration clearance and to collect supplies. `` Someone unfortunately told Mr. <PERSON> Blenkinsop </PERSON> they were going to be arrested on <LOCATION> Biak </LOCATION> and he tried to sail in another direction,'' <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> said. `` After ignoring a warning from one of the police, Mr. <PERSON> Blenkinsop </PERSON> rushed at the police officer. `` His gun exploded and hit Mr. <PERSON> Blenkinsop </PERSON> in the arm. It exploded again and hit Ms. Mist,'' <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> authorities said they could not complete their investigation because they did not have testimony from Ms. Mist. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said later that <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> authorities arrested a policeman and a civilian officer involved in the incident. He said the shootings were appalling and despicable. `` It was a dastardly event,'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said. He told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> he will continue to press for an impartial and proper inquiry and put further pressure on <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> by promising to take up cases of Australians jailed in that country. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said 11 Australians are in <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> jails, mainly in <LOCATION> Bali </LOCATION>, on drug offenses.

<HEAD>Scientists Crack Fierce Math Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mathematicians working with hundreds of computers on three continents have successfully split a record-long 100-digit number into two prime factors, according to a report published today. The final numerical sequence required for the solution flashed into a laboratory in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, at 2:03 a.m. PDT Tuesday, marking a development that will probably force cryptographers to rethink how some codes used by governments and banks are applied in the future, said The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The 100-digit number was chosen by an elaborate mathematical screening process to afford the maximum possible difficulty, the Times said. The two factors found are 41 digits and 60 digits, respectively. A number's factors are smaller numbers that when multiplied by each other produce the larger number. A prime number is one that is evenly divisible only by one or by itself. The project was organized by <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manasse </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Arjen </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenstra </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. They were helped by 12 users of about 400 computers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> who donated computer time when not needed for their regular work. Factoring the 100-digit number took less than a month. In theory, one expert said, a supercomputer like the Cray, operating continuously, could have solved the problem in about a week. But supercomputers cost thousands of dollars an hour to run, and operating the range of simpler computers for short periods when they were idle kept the cost down to virtually nothing, the Times said. There has been rapid progress in the factoring field this year, with the same group establishing a record with a 96-digit number just three weeks ago. According to <PERSON> Lenstra </PERSON>, the record has been broken about once a year this decade. <PERSON> Manasse </PERSON> predicted a 106-digit number will have been factored by the end of the winter. Here is the problem they solved:

<HEAD>Dukakis Finally Responding to Bush's Negative Campaign</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS publishable editor's note at end on writer</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After enduring weeks of attack on hot-button issues such as crime and the flag, the slow-to-anger Democratic presidential nominee responded with the emotion his backers longed for this campaign. But not before <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' own mother did first. `` Can anyone get as low as this?'' 85-year-old <PERSON> Euterpe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked after recounting what she regarded as personal attacks by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Republicans. `` I am telling these truths because my son refuses to,'' she said. Appearing together in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> last weekend, both Dukakises demonstrated dismay at a Republican campaign focusing on a handful of issues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been blamed for trivializing the 1988 presidential campaign. He has devoted weeks to attacking the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> over his veto of a bill requiring the Pledge of Allegiance in schools; over a program allowing weekend furloughs for inmates, including convicted murders; for membership in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>; and for moving slowly on pollution in his own back yard. And he has had help, too. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s reference to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as an `` invalid,'' was quickly retracted _ but the fact that he uttered it thrust onto front pages the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> rumors that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had hidden past mental trouble. The rumors were false, by all evidence. But the episode coincided with the beginning of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s slide in the polls. Republican Sen. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> asserted that an old photo existed of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s wife burning an American flag in protest over the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> denies it. No photo ever emerged. But subtle damage may have been done. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has begun responding with his own negative assaults. On television commercials and in speeches, he belittles <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>; he accuses <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of plotting a `` raid'' on Social Security; and he depicts <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as lacking judgment. All of this is part of what frequently is lamented as the negative nature of the 1988 presidential race. Minor issues, or outright distortions, are screamed while hardly a whisper is heard about the national debt piling up by the billions, relations with the Soviets, the AIDS plague, or the hostages still in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` It is true _ it's a very negative campaign, and I say most of the blame lies with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, political observer at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative think tank. `` I say his campaign is probably the most disgraceful in modern American history,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> adds. `` It is also working. It is both disgraceful and effective.'' The only real surprise, though, is that this type of campaign comes as much of a surprise to anyone. For one thing, look what happened to the two candidates who did talk about the deficit. Democrat <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> four years earlier, found voters did n't want to hear it And the negative campaign is hardly a 1988 phenomenon. `` It is more negative at an earlier stage than any presidential campaign I've seen,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> consultant who has been advising <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on his debates. `` But it follows the pattern of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and gubernatorial races ... The 1980s have seen a real escalation in the use of negative advertising.'' In fact, Democrats have become accustomed over the past eight years to facing intensely negative campaigns centered on one or two or three emotional issues in statewide races. NCPAC, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, ran a series of campaigns in which they targeted <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> incumbents with intensive negative television commercials on a few emotional issues. In 1984, Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> ran negative TV ads about his opponent for more than a year. Democrats have learned to deal with such campaigns by responding forcefully. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s running mate, vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, faced a <ORGANIZATION> NCPAC </ORGANIZATION> campaign in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in 1982, when he was seeking re-election. He fired back and won easily. On his campaign plane last weekend, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> expressed relief that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at last had begun to respond with their own tough ads. `` Where have they been?'' he said, holding out his arms in an expression of frustration at the delay. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign should have responded immediately when, after the Democratic convention in July, the Republicans began attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s record and even his patriotism. Some say <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his advisers are to blame for failing to forsee the attacks, failing to recognize the visceral impact some were having, and failing to respond before the damage was done. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, after all, has never before run against a serious, conservative Republican campaign. `` One reason why he frittered away 17 points was because he did n't respond and did n't go hard negative himself,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>. `` You have to fight fire with fire. You ca n't sit there and take it. And you ca n't just occasionally respond and be defensive. You have to give your response immediately, in tough terms, and then go on the attack yourself. That's modern politics in a nutshell.'' <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON> says the negative campaign should n't be a surprise when viewed in a historical context, too. In 1964, for instance, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> was depicted as representing the threat of nuclear war _ a pretty negative notion. The reason campaigns have grown increasingly negative is that such attacks work. The issues the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign selected seemed to resonate with voters as symbols of something larger and unsettling. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aim was to raise doubts about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and depict him as a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> liberal. He apparently has succeeded. In early August, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has some of the highest negatives ever recorded in the history of American politics.'' He was referring to unfavorable ratings in polls. Two months later, it is <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> who has the high negatives. Polls show his unfavorable rating now tops 40 percent, exceeding that of both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.

 He sang `` Happy Birthday,'' doffed his suitcoat in favor of a football jacket and, to the astonishment of aides, kissed the two cheerleaders who presented the gift. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was delivering what advisers hope he can deliver again Thursday night in his final debate with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ a genuine show of emotion, something <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rarely allows himself on the campaign trail. The Democratic presidential nominee arrived here late Tuesday night and was staying in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area until the showdown with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` One of the nice things about debates is that they get people out from behind the balloons and out of the flag factory and it gets them to address the issues,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a crowd of about 350 people at the airport here. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor had no public events scheduled today but was holding meetings with about 20 aides and advisers on the debate. The confrontation could prove crucial to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' attempts to overcome <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who holds a slight lead in most polls but is believed to have a larger edge in <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> votes. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides, speaking to reporters on the flight from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said they believed voters were still not familiar with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and that one of his major debate challenges would be to convince voters he cares more about their concerns than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Those aides were thrilled by what they saw in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held an airport rally while his plane was refueled Tuesday night. About 800 people who braved 45-degree temperatures to attend the late-night rally appeared happy with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' performance as well. He had just finished greeting the state and local officials on hand when he introduced <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> coordinator for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and the son of the 1984 Democratic nominee, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the crowd <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> celebrates his 31st birthday today. Then came the unexpected: <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led the crowd in singing `` Happy Birthday,'' with even <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> looking on in apparent surprise. An upbeat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delivered his standard stump speech to the crowd and told them `` victory is out there'' if they work hard for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> victory. He also took his staple swipe at <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> mentioned his choice, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, and referred to him as `` the best qualified person for the job.'' `` I wonder if the Republicans can say the same?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, sporting a broad grin, asked rhetorically. At the end of the rally, two cheerleaders from <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 1 ranked team in <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> Division II football, presented <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with a bright yellow <ORGANIZATION> Bisons </ORGANIZATION> jacket, which he quickly donned before thanking the cheerleaders with a kiss on the cheek. He sported the jacket on the flight from <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> as well. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' pre-debate coaching has been rich with suggestions that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> make an emotional connection with voters. `` I think it's very important that the American people know his values, know what he cares about,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, the campaign's vice chairman, said during the flight West. `` The question is: Where are you going to lead us?'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coehlo </PERSON>, who traveled with the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> entourage, said many voters would consider <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a `` blind date'' because they do not know enough about him. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people do n't want to elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Coehlo </PERSON> said. `` They think he's OK but they do n't want to elect him. They want another option and just need to get to know <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to have it.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides also make no secret of the fact that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will be a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> debate target. `` It's obvious that a lot of people are frightened,'' <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> said. `` This is a guy who is a heartbeat away from the presidency. ... It scares people.'' At the same time, though, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will try to frame the Quayle selection in the larger context of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment and also try to contrast the proposals on health care, college opportunity, housing, trade and education in recent weeks with what the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp terms as a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign of `` symbols and slogans'' that lacks substance. `` They do n't like where the dialogue is going and they want to get it back on, who knows what, the Pledge of Allegiance,'' <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> said. `` This is not a ping pong match of one liners.''

<HEAD>Iraq and Iran Exchange Soldiers' Bodies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> exchanged soldiers' remains for the first time since their cease-fire took effect seven weeks ago, a senior <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said. But an Iraqi government-run newspaper said there was no progress in U.N.-mediated talks toward a permanent peace settlement. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Assistant Secretary-General <PERSON> Marrack </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> told a news conference in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital that each side on Tuesday handed over the bodies of eight soldiers killed during the eight-year war. He said the exchange took place in the war front's southern sector, but gave no further details. <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>, visiting <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for talks on consolidating the cease-fire, said the exchange was `` a sad and moving event but it showed that through the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> there can be cooperation between the two sides.'' <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> was scheduled to leave today for <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for talks with Iranian officials and a visit to the Iranian side of the front. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping troops are posted along the Iraq-Iran border to monitor the cease-fire that went into effect Aug. 20. Peace talks started Aug. 25 but are bogged down over <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s demand for free navigation in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and clearing the <PERSON> Shaat </PERSON> al-Arab waterway. <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> said the cease-fire was holding although both sides reported minor violations and `` two or three'' soldiers were killed. He gave no details of how the deaths occurred. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official also said some soldiers had been taken prisoner since the cease-fire.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> may be willing to grant sanctuary to <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, leader of the feared <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, to clear the way for a settlement of the war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, diplomats say. The communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, blamed for mass executions and forced relocations during nearly four years of brutal rule in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, were overthrown by the Vietnamese in 1978. But the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>'s continued presence as a potent guerrilla force has been viewed as an obstacle to negotiating the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> supported the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> when it ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> but has been distancing itself from the group. Diplomats have said that <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>'s exile to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> may accelerate a settlement in the conflict. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has not ruled out such a development. `` The Chinese government would take any alien as a refugee to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> if the whole affair conforms with Chinese law,'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <LOCATION> Yuan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shibing </LOCATION>, said Tuesday. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said it would withdraw its troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by 1990 and has been negotiating with the three-member <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance, which includes the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. Diplomats say <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s acceptance of <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> could help pave the way for a settlement. `` This offer is what <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> intends to do if it is necessary that <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> and his close collegues should be given exile somehwere outside of Kampuchea -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' said one <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> diplomat familiar with negotiations, speaking on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, he said, still insists that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdraw its troops as a first step in any settlement. The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, described a possible offer of exile as `` the bottom line,'' but not something that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> immediately would offer. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, meanwhile, <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, leader of one of the factions fighting the Vietnamese occupation, said Tuesday: `` I think it is necessary to give the world some guarantee about the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in the future. `` I think the ones who are responsible for the genocide of the Cambodian people'' in the 1970s `` must not continue to lead the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> movement and they must go into exile if possible,'' he said after a meeting with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president reiterated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy favoring a complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and opposing a return to power of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. In a sign of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s distancing itself from <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, Chinese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> recently told the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> that the armies of the Cambodian factions should be dissolved and replaced with a new national army, equally representing all factions. <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>'s regime has been blamed for killing an estimated 1 million people. Chinese officials were expected to meet this week with ambassadors of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to discuss the Cambodian problem. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is the strongest of three factions fighting <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupying forces in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Besides the non-communist forces of <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the resistance includes the forces of <LOCATION> Son </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sann </LOCATION>, a Western-leaning politician.

<HEAD>Defense Minister Calls Region's Foreign Debt Its Biggest Security

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's defense minister says <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s foreign debt is a bigger security risk than its drug trade, insurgencies or border conflicts. `` Behind the drug trafficking and behind the subversion is the incommensurable weight of the foreign debt, which erodes and asphyxiates our economies,'' said Gen. <PERSON> Italo </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Valle </PERSON> <PERSON> Alliegro </PERSON>. `` It is not just an economic problem, but a political and social problem that can create strong centers of disturbance for our systems,'' <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Valle </PERSON> <PERSON> Alliegro </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> this week. Latin American countries are struggling to pay foreign debts totaling over $ 400 billion. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, which owes at least $ 34 billion, is the region's fourth-largest debtor. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Valle </PERSON>, named defense minister in July, said <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s armed forces are committed to defending a 30-year-old democratic system `` We have a solid and mature democracy, and our armed forces are convinced of their role of supporting the nation's civil institutions,'' he said. He said <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> never adopted the doctrine of national security which led to military takeovers throughout <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because it felt the theory was `` authoritarian and anti-democratic.'' The theory, which broadened the scope of national defense to allow the military a legitimate political role in keeping out communism, originated in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and was further expanded by the Brazilian armed forces. It is credited with having opened the way for military ousters of civilian rulers in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and other countries in the 1960s and early 1970s. He said a document backed last year by military leaders throughout <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, did not constitute a joint defense pact. The document identified the international communist movement as the `` common and principal threat'' to the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>. It was issued by 14 Latin American nations and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> during the <ORGANIZATION> 17th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, which took place at <LOCATION> Mar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plata </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in November 1987. `` It was one working paper among many others. There is no anti-communist pact,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reiterated his concern over Western European plans for economic integration, saying they could work against cooperation with the East, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. In a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> meeting with Austrian Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON>, the 57-year-old Soviet leader said Tuesday that Europeans have been striving for economic internationalization and political independence. `` But on the other hand, what awaits the all-European process if the Western part of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> cruelly closes itself off in a new formation?'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> asked, in excerpts reported by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency. `` How, then, would a ` European home' be built?'' he said, referring to a concept that calls on East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europeans </LOCATION> to cooperate politically and economically. It was the second time <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has expressed concern to a high Western European official over plans by the 12-member <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> to create a single market in 1992, by eliminating borders and unifying customs regulations. <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> is not an <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> member.

<TEXT>
 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says an agreement in principle has been reached on the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, but that the timetable still needs to be worked out. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, speaking at a press conference Tuesday, dismissed press reports that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> had agreed during weekend a meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on a timetable for a troop withdrawal. `` The principle has been accepted, but the timetable needs to be worked out,'' he said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has scheduled for Nov. 1 the start of an independence plan for neighboring <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, but it has linked Namibian independence to a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> warned that the Nov. 1 deadline for beginning the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> independence plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> may not be met. `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> wants to see <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to be independent,'' he said. But he said if `` other forces'' who are taking part `` are not prepared to start with the necessary machinery on the first of November, that is not <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s fault. He did not elaborate. The parties involved in the talks are to meet later this month in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alarcon </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Quesada </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacavira </PERSON>, also said Tuesday that negotiators reached no agreement in talks held Friday through Sunday. They spoke at a news conference in response to published reports saying the talks reached agreement on a 24 - to 30-month pullout by the Cubans `` We are at an impasse, which is not precisely synonymous with agreement,''' said <PERSON> Alarcon </PERSON>. `` As you can see in the newspapers' reports almost daily, we have n't yet achieved an agreement or understanding on the calendar for the withdrawal of the Cuban forces in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Alarcon </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> need 30 months to train and equip Angolan forces to deal with any future raids by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> or by the Angolan rebels that are backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

 Federal agents gave new meaning to `` hostile takeover'' by smashing a $ 32 million global money-laundering ring that routed drug profits through a bank to Colombian cocaine cartels, authorities say. Customs agents infiltrated <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> money-laundering syndicates and helped smuggle profits from drug sales out of the country, federal authorities charged Tuesday in a series of indictments naming 85 defendants. The charges resulted from a two-year investigation dubbed `` Operation C Chase.'' The `` C'' stands for C-note, slang for $ 100 bills. Among the defendants were <ORGANIZATION> BCCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>, a Luxembourg-based bank holding company with branches in 72 countries, and nine bank officials. `` It is the first time an entire financial institution and its important members have been indicted,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>. `` We have given new meaning to the term ` hostile takeover.''' Tuesday's announcement came two days after the arrest here of 11 people, including seven en route to a bogus bachelor party, officials said. The `` bride'' and `` groom'' were actually undercover agents. At least 40 people have been arrested around the world, including this country, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, officials said. Named along with <ORGANIZATION> BCCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> were two subsidiaries: <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, with operations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -RRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, organized in the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and operating in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Authorities said the scheme operated this way: Bank officials placed drug money in certificates of deposit in branches in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, then created a loan at another branch and allowed the traffickers to withdraw the funds. The bank repaid the loan with funds in the CDs, officials said. Indictments were returned in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, and warrants were issued in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` For some international banks, their sleaze factor is higher than their interest rates. That's what we're talking about here _ just pure greed,'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said at a news conference. He said the case should serve notice that the gates for smugglers are closing around the world. In congressional hearings this year, <ORGANIZATION> BCCI </ORGANIZATION> and an assistant director of its <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> office, who was among those indicted, were identified as helping <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> hide drug-trafficking profits. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted her and in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on drug charges. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> refused to comment on whether <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was involved in the alleged laundering. The bank said in a statement that it `` is wholly unaware of any violations of law that allegedly have been committed,'' but was confident `` the outcome will be satisfactory.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> on Tuesday lifted a federal restraining order preventing <ORGANIZATION> BCCI </ORGANIZATION> from conducting all but routine business without clearance from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals. <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> acted after an escrow account was established and the bank deposited $ 14 million, the amount the government alleged was laundered. <ORGANIZATION> BCCI </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1972 by a group of <LOCATION> Pakistanibankers </LOCATION> with seed capital from <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> rich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> investors. <ORGANIZATION> BCCI </ORGANIZATION> has assets of about $ 20 billion and reserves of $ 1.5 billion. The trade journal <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banker </ORGANIZATION> said the privately held <ORGANIZATION> BCCI </ORGANIZATION> ranks 326th among the world's biggest banks, as measured by deposits, and 378th by assets. According to one indictment, undercover agents began the investigation in July 1986, dealing primarily with <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> controlled a laundering network in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, home of the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION>, to service traffickers <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>, also known as `` <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Chepe </PERSON>,'' in that city and <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Baez-Alcaino </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the indictment said Undercover agents received the money from various defendants and laundered it for a commission, officials said. In most instances, it was deposited in bank accounts here, then transmitted to <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> via blank checks drawn on the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> account, prosecutors said. Agents first contacted <ORGANIZATION> BCCI </ORGANIZATION> representatives in February 1987 and began opening accounts at various branches in July, the indictment said. The indictments alleged possession and smuggling conspiracies, as well as conspiracy to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, launder proceeds of domestic cocaine sales and engage in a continuing criminal enterprise. The major defendants face a maximum sentence of life in prison and fines of more than $ 5 million if convicted on all counts. The bank faces maximum fines of more than $ 45 million. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is seeking forfeiture of property, funds in about 40 bank accounts and <ORGANIZATION> BCCI </ORGANIZATION> assets.

<TEXT>
 Male strippers cavorted too close to female patrons at a fire department fund-raiser, upsetting some husbands and violating a state law requiring performers to remain at least 6 feet away, a prosecutor said. During the male dance revue last month, strippers came close enough for members of the <ORGANIZATION> Taneytown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s women's auxiliary to tuck dollar bills in the dancers' G-strings, Assistant State's Attorney <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Trivas </PERSON> said State liquor laws require G-string clad strippers in eight counties to keep 6 feet between them and patrons. The law also forbids the touching of buttocks. `` Had I been aware of these things, I might have been able to talk with these gentlemen and explain what they could do,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, secretary of the women's auxiliary, whose members paid $ 10 each to see the Sept. 23 show. The <LOCATION> Carroll </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> liquor board, which took the matter under consideration after a few husbands lodged complaints, expects to render a decision in 30 days on whether the fire department was responsible for allowing the violation to occur. Possible penalties include a $ 2,000 fine. Ms. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> asked the liquor board Tuesday for leniency, saying she did not learn about the 6-foot rule until moments before the event started. Ms. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said the show, which raised $ 2,000, could not have been canceled that night `` without a demonstration.'' Mustang, Rebel, <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> and Flash were among members of `` The Fox,'' a traveling troupe from <LOCATION> Lansdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, who have performed for more than 400 fire department women's auxilaries in seven states, Ms. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said. Fire Department President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who obtained the liquor license for the event, told the liquor board he agreed with the prosecutor's interpretation of the law. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> admitted he was warned about the law when the board granted a one-day liquor license for the revue. He contended the women failed to heed his warning, issued less than two hours before the show began.

He reasoned that the South Africans were confronted with Soviet equipment in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be providing this information to them.'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dolce </PERSON> delivered the document to Redelinghuys because of its potential use for sabotage by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a staunchly anti-communist country that is ruled by its white minority under a system of racial segregation called apartheid. <PERSON> Dolce </PERSON> also acknowledged delivering batches of classified documents on 40 or more occasions, by mail and in person, to three military attaches at the embassy and to South African missions in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> between the fall of 1979 and the summer of 1983. For agreeing to plead guilty to the single count and to cooperate with prosecutors, he was not prosecuted under a more severe statute carrying a maximum sentence of life in prison. <PERSON> Dolce </PERSON> had security clearance through his work for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Material </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Activity </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> agency charged with evaluating weapons systems. <PERSON> Glaser </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dolce </PERSON> was the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen involved, adding the government learned of his client's activities `` inadvertantly.'' The lawyer declined to elaborate. Authorities said <PERSON> Dolce </PERSON> had insisted his activities were motivated by ideological, rather than financial, concerns. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said there is no evidence that <PERSON> Dolce </PERSON> accepted money. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities would not discuss the extent of the damage Dolce's activities caused to national security. <PERSON> Alayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Resberg </PERSON>, press secretary for the South African Embassy, said her country considered the matter `` history.'' `` Two of the officers allegedly involved have already retired from active service, and the third officer is no longer in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` We would just like to point out that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> does n't consider itself an unfriendly nation toward the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>,'' she said, adding that neither the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> nor the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has talked to anyone in the embassy about the case Dolce ended his relationship with the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> in 1983, apparently because of a personality clash with the embassy's new defense attache, authorities said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> ordered <ORGANIZATION> Dolce </ORGANIZATION> held in jail without bail pending a sentencing date, which has yet to be set. Prosecutors said they would recommend Dolce be given the maximum sentence.

 At least 15 people have been killed this week by police enforcing a curfew in a southern district, authorities said today. Officers at the military command said five people were killed Monday in the town of <LOCATION> Gandara </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Matara </LOCATION> district, when Sinhalese demonstrators attacked a police station during a strike to protest the government's attempts to win over Tamil rebels. An indefinite curfew was imposed in the Sinhalese-dominated district after the incident, and police were ordered to shoot violators. At least 10 people, including two women, were killed and 36 others injured when police fired at demonstrators defying the orders, said the officers, who can not be identified under briefing rules. Monday's strike was called by the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a radical Sinhalese group, which has opposed the July 1987 peace accord aimed at ending the 5-year-old war by Tamil militants. The separatist war has claimed at least 8,500 lives. The accord was sponsored by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which got involved in the ethnic problems of its southern neighbor because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils to the rebel cause. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sent in at least 47,000 soldiers to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> when the Tamils reneged on the peace plan.

<HEAD>Alamo Battle's Descendants Still Fight On</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Alamo may have been at peace since 1836, but descendants of those who fought there have a new battle brewing over control of $ 1.7 million banked from souvenir sales at the shrine. The Daughters of the Republic of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> have always had charge of the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> and its bank account. But the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION>, angered over what it calls a misrepresentation of history by the Daughters, says they should turn any surplus over to the state. `` In my opinion, all they want to do is get their hands on the money,'' <PERSON> Ella </PERSON> <PERSON> Stumpf </PERSON>, 84, one of the Daughters, said this week. The Alamo is a self-financing facility: No state tax money is invested and the Daughters must generate funds from the souvenir shop to pay for a staff of 65 and an annual budget in excess of $ 1 million. The mission, visited by 3 million people a year, occupies four acres of state land in downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. The Daughters serve at the pleasure of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, which alone has authority to end their custodial role. `` I do n't think too many people knew they had $ 1.7 million in the bank off sales from their souvenir shop. I do n't think anyone had ever asked,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, whose inquiry into the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> ledgers started the current flap. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said unless the Daughters `` have a great purpose for these funds'' the money could become available to the state. When the attorney general ruled that the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> finances fell under the Texas Open Records Act, the Daughters sent a copy of their latest audited budget to <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. `` We'd never had to face this before. ... We're happy to do whatever the proper authorities want us to do. We do n't have anything to hide,'' said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dibrell </PERSON>, a member of the Daughters' <ORGANIZATION> Alamo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Attached to the audit was a note explaining the intended plans for the surplus funds: a new film and activity center, two new educational films and a permanent operating `` hedge'' against a sudden drop-off in tourism. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>, president of the Latin American citizens league, was quick to call for a full accounting of the finances, with any surplus funds be considered for other state programs. `` Quite frankly, we are n't very adamant about taking over the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>. Our main issue is we want accountability by whomever is running it to the peoples of the state and to the history of our citizenry,'' he said. `` The Daughters have created their history by perpetuating myth and by omission: These thousands of bad Mexicans killed our few good Anglos and this has made the chapel a symbol of oppression.'' About 180 Texans, including <PERSON> Davy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON>, died at the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> fort-chapel when it was attacked by an army of thousands of Mexicans during the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Revolution in 1836. But <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, the legislator, said there is no historical or cultural component to his inquiry. `` I do n't have time to get annoyed by what did or did n't happen in 1836,'' he said. `` What is at issue is access to records about finances that should be public. My name could be <PERSON> Davy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> the Fifth and I'd be asking the same questions.''

 Highly radioactive waste from the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> will be shipped to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> under a project being reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the agency says. A proposed facility at the nuclear weapons plant would prepare the waste for shipment starting next year to the department's Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, according to an environmental assessment by the agency issued Monday. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> plant would eventually remove a potential source of groundwater contamination from <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>: thousands of cubic feet of stored waste containing elements heavier than uranium, which are called `` transuranic.'' Plutonium, manufactured at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for use in nuclear weapons, is a transuranic element. The three nuclear weapons reactors at the plant near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION> have been closed for maintenance and safety checks amid a wave of publicity about lax safety precautions. <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is one of 14 sites that generate or store transuranic wastes in nuclear weapons work and that will ship them to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> plant is a research facility designed to demonstrate the safe and environmentally acceptable disposal of radioactive defense waste, the report said. The <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> facility would analyze, compact and solidify newly generated waste. By 1995, when <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is to start retrieving previously stored waste for shipment, a projected 370,000 cubic feet of stored transuranic waste will have accumulated there, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report says. Waste is stored in containers and trenches at the plant. Starting in 1995, the report said, <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>'s facility would ship away 15,000 cubic feet of retrieved waste per year, and export new waste as fast as it accumulates, at a projected rate of 6,200 cubic feet per year. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> project, which has itself drawn criticism from environmentalists, will not end the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> plant's environmental woes A report issued this week by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> notes that hazardous but non-radioactive wastes also have accumulated at numerous sites around the plant. Some reports estimate the total cost of cleaning up the plant at $ 6.5 billion. In addition, the transuranic project does not include waste buried before 1970. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> decided the environmental benefits were not worth the risks of unearthing the waste, the report suggested.

<TEXT>
 A pre-dawn fire ripped through the headquarters of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> today. Authorities said it was arson. There were no injuries, but a nun and three other people staying in the building were rescued by firemen after they were trapped on a balcony by the flames. `` If it had n't been for the fast action of the fire department, we would have all been killed,'' said one of the four, <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>. It was the second major attack in six weeks on the headquarters of an anti-apartheid church organization. The main office of the South African Council of Churches was devastated by a bomb Aug. 31. Police said four nearly empty containers of gasoline and paraffin were found on the ground floor of <ORGANIZATION> Khanya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. The fire seriously damaged the organization's archives and print shop on the ground floor and also caused damage on two upper floors. Police said a mini-bus with 11 people inside, including blacks and whites, was seen by a policeman at the building shortly before the fire broke out about 2 a.m. The vehicle had a false license plate, police said. No arrests have been made in connection with the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Khotso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, which housed the offices of the council of churches and other organizations seeking an end to apartheid, or the white-minority goverment's policy of racial segregation. Leading activists have suggested the bombing was carried out either by right-wing vigilantes or by a covert security force unit. The <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is predominantly black. Two weeks ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops distributed a pastoral letter suggesting Catholics consider not voting in this month's nationwide municipal elections. Activists say the elections for segregated local councils serve only to entrench apartheid and will bring blacks no closer to obtaining voting rights on the national level.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> has deleted references to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> as `` savages'' from a Thanksgiving-related `` Peanuts'' cartoon because an Indian parents group here complained, a network official said. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Altieri </PERSON>, vice president of program practices for the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, said the producer's notes on the script to `` The Mayflower Voyagers'' indicate that the word `` savages'' has been dropped throughout. The `` Peanuts'' special is scheduled to air Oct. 21 as part of an animated historical miniseries called `` This Is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>.'' Ms. <PERSON> Altieri </PERSON> said the change was made because of concerns raised by the Concerned American Indian Parents group of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliate in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> WCCO-TV </ORGANIZATION>. She said no other affiliates had complained. The network distributed scripts of the cartoon and teaching instructions to affiliate stations, which distributed them to participating schools, said <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw-Livesey </PERSON>, director of educational and community services for CBS in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Because the script referred to <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> as `` savages'' in at least two places and included historical inaccuracies that gave negative portrayals of Indians, <ORGANIZATION> WCCO-TV </ORGANIZATION> shortened the script and revised the teaching instructions, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON>, a consultant for the station. He said the material being given to 52,000 students at about 150 schools in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> was changed to `` foster cultural sensitivity.'' `` We're going to go with the revised one to remove anything that would be insensitive to the Native Americans,'' Cousins said. `` It was corresponding with myths rather than actuality.'' He said the cartoon wrongly portrays Indians as giving `` war whoops'' and unfairly portrays the Indian Squanto, who befriended the Pilgrims, as a `` grateful slave'' who learned English after being kidnapped by an Englishman who took him away to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` The war whoops are a myth of the old-time cowboy movies,'' Cousins said. In the finished program, <PERSON> Squanto </PERSON> says, `` I served a wonderful man who also had me learn English. And that man finally gave me my freedom to sail back here to my land.'' The network-distributed script was shortened by Cousins so that it ends with the Mayflower's arrival in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and the teaching instructions were revised to suggest ways for teachers to discuss myths surrounding Thanksgiving, Cousins said. A committee that included an American Indian and a human relations professor at St. <ORGANIZATION> Cloud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> agreed on the changes, he said. Ms. <PERSON> Altieri </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> will air the program despite objections from Concerned American Indian Parents. `` We're not stereotyping Indians or Native Americans here as much as we are telling the story of a man -LRB- Squanto -RRB- who, through extreme adverse experiences in his life, brought those experiences to bear in becoming the salvation of people who landed in this strange land,'' Ms. <PERSON> Altieri </PERSON> said. She said the actual program may not come off as harsh as the advance script in the eyes of those who have complained. `` I think it might be a mistake to make the judgement prior to seeing the program,'' she said. But <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, a member of the parents group in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, said he still objects to airing of the program.

<HEAD>South Korea Ready To Make Concessions In Talks With North Korea</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 South Korean delegates, elated by their country's success as Olympic host, will be more flexible when they resume talks with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> Thursday on reunification, officials said today. The talks at the border truce site of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> will be the first meeting between parliamentary officials of the two Koreas since the 1988 Summer Olympics ended in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Oct. 2. `` The Olympics have given us new impetus. We will be more flexible,'' a senior government party official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The two sides began discussions Aug. 21 on possible formal talks between the two Koreas' parliaments but made no major progress in four meetings. In the fourth session Aug. 26, each accused the other of blocking agreement, but they agreed to resume discussions after the Olympics. The two sides differed widely over both the agenda and format of the proposed formal talks. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> demanded a joint meeting of the nearly 1,000 members of the two Koreas' parliaments, but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> sought a smaller meeting. `` We will be flexible about the two pending issues and make new proposals,'' the South Korean official said. At Thursday's meeting, he said, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would suggest that each side send up to 100 delegates to the main talks. Previously, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> had sought to limit the number to 25. In its flexible stand on the agenda, the official said, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> may agree to discuss a North Korean proposal that the parliaments of the two sides issue a joint `` non-aggression statement.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said any such statement should call, among other things, for the withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and drastic arms reductions by the two Koreas. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> had sought to sign a non-aggression treaty rather than a non-aggression statement, which has no binding force, but <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> officials maintained that the two Koreas are not separate states and thus can not conclude a treaty. South Korean officials said they would take a `` soft stand'' and try to accommodate North Korean proposals as much as possible, but they did not say whether they would consider the North Korean proposal for a pullout of the American troops and arms reductions. Other topics expected to arise at the meeting include a recent call by South Korean President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo for summit talks with North Korean ruler <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, the official said. In a major policy speech on Oct. 4, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> renewed a call for summit talks with <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> and said he was ready to end rivalry and confrontation on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. The summit, if held, would be the first since the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula was divided in 1945 into the Communist North and capitalist South. In response to <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s proposal, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s official radio said on Sunday the proposed summit would not be possible unless <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> accepted <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>'s pre-conditions, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Naewoe </ORGANIZATION> reported.

 Palestinians hurled a hand grenade at a civilian Israeli car in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> today, and in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers blew up or sealed nine houses of suspected activists, the army said. <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, a city of 120,000, was under army-imposed curfew for the sixth straight day today following a bloody clash last week in which troops shot and killed four people and wounded 21. Residents said they were running short of food. No injuries were reported in the grenade attack on Nasir Street in the center of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the second such assault in two days. On Tuesday, a Palestinian tossed a hand grenade at an Israeli patrol in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and wounded two soldiers, the army said. The two Arab attacks were among only a few involving firearms in the 10-months-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since 1967. Six Israelis and 295 Palestinian have died in the uprising that began Dec. 8. The army said the grenade today missed its target. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio and an Arab reporter in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> said troops closed the area and started searching house to house for suspects after the morning incident. In Tuesday's attack, a Soviet-made grenade was thrown at the first vehicle in a military patrol from the grounds of <LOCATION> Nasir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in a residential section of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Soldiers found the grenade pin and handle in the courtyard of the hospital, an army spokesman said on condition of anonymity. Two army sergeants were lightly wounded in their legs. Also in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the army today detained <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazouri </PERSON>, an Arab pharmacist and the secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Mujama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al-Islami </ORGANIZATION>, or Islamic Grouping, a radical religious group. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazouri </PERSON> is believed to be the operational leader of Moslem fundamentalists in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports as saying other fundamentalist leaders were detained in the last few days. The arrests followed a rapprochement between radical Moslems and pro-PLO activists, declared in the latest leaflets of the underground Moslem <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> movement and the PLO-linked Unified National Leadership of the Uprising. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, soldiers blew up four houses and sealed off five others in the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the Ras El-Ein neighborhood, the army said. It said the houses belonged to Arabs suspected of being members in a nine-man squad of `` strike forces'' that enforced orders by underground uprising leaders. It said several members of the squad were arrested. They were accused of hacking and stabbing to death three Arabs suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> in September, of beating other Palestinians and of inciting riots. The squad's members belonged to <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the mainstream faction of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, the army said. <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> residents, under an army-imposed curfew, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> telephone lines in the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were cut off for the last four days. Burning tires were seen in the streets of the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and some Palestinians climbed the rooftops to whistle and shout Islamic slogans as an army helicopter circled overhead, those reached by relephone in nearby areas said. `` There are many soldiers in the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, some of them also on the roofs, and many army cars,'' one woman said. `` We saw the smoke from the explosion when they destroyed a house.'' <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> residents also complained of food shortages caused by the curfew. `` People are starving. This is the sixth day of curfew. We need help. The babies are without milk. I called all the foreign embassies and we hope they will help us,'' said prominent <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennaan </PERSON>. The army denied the charges. An army spokeswoman said <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and hospital officials were permitted to move freely in the city. The curfew was lifted for two hours Tuesday to allow residents to buy food, she said.

 Tourists could once again get a bird's eye view of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> today after workers at the Eiffel Tower ended a four-day strike. The 100-year-old steel tower, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s top tourist attraction, had been closed to visitors since Saturday morning because of the strike by the 130 employees. Early today, a union strike committee announced that all the strikers' key demands had been met, including an increase of about 30 cents in the $ 4.60 hourly wage. The Eiffel Tower stands 984 feet high, with three observation levels, and is one of the few tall structures looking out over the rooftops of a city of five - and six-story buildings When it opened in 1888, it was the world's tallest structure.

Mrs. <PERSON> Wrather </PERSON> died Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> here, said family spokesman <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>. A statement from the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> called Mrs. <PERSON> Wrather </PERSON> `` a figure of beauty and grace in the motion-picture business.'' `` But more than that, she was a warm and caring friend. For so many years, she enriched our lives with her sparkling personality, her wonderful sense of humor, her loyalty and her love,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> said. One of her last public appearances was in June, when she retired as chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` We grieve with the family that this vital woman, whose life spanned so many accomplishments as an actress, wife, mother, corporate executive, philanthropist, inspirational leader and friend, will no longer be at our side,'' said institute director <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Firstenberg </PERSON>. She had been chairwoman of <ORGANIZATION> Wrather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the entertainment conglomerate that ran the <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION> and Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Spruce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goose </ORGANIZATION> attractions in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and owned syndication rights to the `` Lone Ranger'' and `` Lassie'' television shows.

<TEXT>
 Seven current and former <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> detectives have been sentenced to two to five years in prison for shaking down bars and restaurants, but say they'll appeal their convictions. The four former and three current detectives were sentenced Tuesday after having been found guilty last month of conspiring to extort more than $ 18,000 in bribes in return for protecting bars and restaurants from inspections, overlooking violations or seeking to influence liquor regulations cases. Prosecutors <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kottmyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> charged the detectives with selling their badges for influence, while defense attorneys maintained that the detectives were only accepting gifts from people they worked with closely over several years. The sentences handed down by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> were lower than those sought by the prosecutors, but <PERSON> Kottmyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> said they were satisfied. `` The message is that police officers, just like all other citizens, are bound by the constraints of the law,'' <PERSON> Kottmyer </PERSON> said. Explaining the sentences, <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> said, `` It's difficult not to be impressed by their records.'' Former detective <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> got the stiffest sentence: five years. The others received sentences of two years or three years. `` They sold the public trust in return for personal gain,'' <PERSON> Kottmyer </PERSON> said in arguing for penalties of up to 10 years. A defense attorney, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardinale </PERSON>, said an appeal was planned, challenging rulings by <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> that prevented the defense from attacking the credibility of prosecution witnesses, some of whom, the detectives claim, were bar owners of dubious repute. Addressing the court before he was sentences, defendant <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> drew applause from some 30 detectives when he told <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON>: `` I do n't think in my heart I ever sold my badge. ... I am not a racketeer; I never have been a racketeer.''

 A judge today approved the execution of two Sikhs convicted in the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, news reports said. District Judge <PERSON> S.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jain </PERSON> signed the `` black warrants'' authorizing the hanging of <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said. The warrants were delivered to the superintendent of the maximum-security Tihar Central Jail in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, where the two men are being held, the news agency reported. The execution date was not immediately disclosed, the news agency said. Shortly after the warrants were signed, lawyers for both men appealed for mercy to President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON>, who must rule within 90 days, a Home Ministry spokesman said on condition of anonymity. The convictions and death sentences for both men has been upheld and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has rejected their appeals. The conviction and death sentence of a third man, <PERSON> Balbir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, was overturned in August for lack of evidence. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was shot and killed in the garden of her home on Oct. 31, 1984, by two of her Sikh bodyguards, <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. Both were involved in a gun battle with other security guards minutes after the assassination, and <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> died of bullet wounds. The two are not related. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, which means lion in the Punjabi language, is part of every Sikh's name by doctrine of the faith. <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s maternal uncle, was arrested on Nov. 30, 1984, and charged with conspiracy in the case. The assassination was apparently in revenge for an army raid Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> ordered four months earlier on the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, the holiest Sikh shrine, to counter separatist militants entrenched inside. At least 1,200 died in the raid, most of them Sikhs. After an eight-month trial in a makeshift courtroom at Tihar Central Jail, <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was convicted of assassinating Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Balbir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> were found guilty of aiding the conspiracy. The <ORGANIZATION> Delhi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the convictions and death sentences on Dec. 3, 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 3 also confirmed the death sentences of <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, but acquitted <PERSON> Balbir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>.

 Tanks and troops disappeared from the streets of <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> at dawn today when the government abruptly lifted a state of emergency imposed during violent nationwide protests last week. Armored personnel carriers and tanks rumbled away from public buildings and main intersections at 5 a.m. in this <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> port city. Only the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and other military installations were manned by soldiers. But more than 3,000 looters and agitators arrested in the last hours of the state of emergency still were being held in the police school at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Biar </LOCATION> and elsewhere. The government acknowledged that at least 180 people were killed nationwide in the past week, but unofficial counts placed the death toll at more than 500. More than 1,000 people were said to have been injured, mostly by machine-gun fire directed at crowds of demonstrators. Shops were open today, and government offices, public services and <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>' vital harbor were functioning normally. A 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew was also lifted, effective this morning. Islamic fundamentalists, recognizable among the generally European-clad population of <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> by their flowing white robes, could not be found this morning. They had sought to take over the spontaneous protests against high prices and a government austerity program, and their calls for demonstrations were widely followed. President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> promised in a nationwide television address Monday to meet demands for economic and political reform. He said there would be a purge of those responsible for the crisis, but he gave no specifics. There was speculation <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherif </PERSON> <PERSON> Messaadia </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the sole legal political party, would be among those purged. The party and its boss have not spoken publicly since the crisis began Oct. 4. Political analysts said the party's authority has been seriously reduced by the riots. In his speech, <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> made no mention of the party, saying political reforms would be publicly debated and perhaps submitted to a referendum. Bendjedid's speech was widely seen as weak, but the government organized `` spontaneous'' demonstrations of support for it throughout the country. Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, say the official death toll of about 180 was low, but they also contended that reports of up to 500 dead were exaggerated. Reliable accounts from hospital, medical and police sources indicated at least 400 people died and more than 1,000 were injured in the biggest crisis faced by the government since its independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1962. Among those killed in violence Monday was <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Benmechiche </PERSON>, a senior editor at the official <ORGANIZATION> Algerie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said diplomatic and family sources. The government announced Friday that 900 people were arrested, but sources following judicial proceedings said more than 3,000 people were in custody. In the eastern city of <LOCATION> Annaba </LOCATION>, trials began Tuesday for people arrested during the riots, and six demonstrators were sentenced to prison terms ranging from four to eight years, the <ORGANIZATION> Algerian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. According to lawyers present in the courtroom, the charges were vandalism, sabotage and attacks on government and private property. Food shortages, soaring prices and low wages were among the complaints when the protests began in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> and more than a dozen provincial cities. Demonstrators targeted an austerity program introduced by Bendjedid in January. Measures include cutting food subsidies, reducing the workforce at some nationalized industries and giving those industries more autonomy. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, which has a Soviet-style centrally directed economy, has been hurt by the crash of oil prices. More than 95 percent of the north African country's exports come from oil and natural gas.

 A Soviet economist says boosting food subsidies will only fuel inflation but that modernizing agriculture will help reduce waste that costs $ 96 billion annually. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khmelkov </PERSON>, an economist and director of a Moscow-area farming enterprise, said that to finance more subsidies, the government probably will have to take the money from state-run enterprises, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda reported Tuesday. Those enterprises in turn would be forced to raise prices to make up for the loss, he said. `` In a word, it's a race in a circle. -LRB- Price increases -RRB- would not strengthen the economy, but destabilize it. And the destabilization would start with those with the lowest incomes,'' Pravda quoted him as saying. Many Soviet economists have said the prices of basic commodities must be increased in the next few years to make the economy more efficient. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has promised consumers will be compensated for any price increases. <PERSON> Khmelkov </PERSON> said that officials must instead keep strict control over prices and end vast inefficiencies in agriculture. As an example, he said a new kind of milking machine that could easily be produced in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would increase milk production by 10 percent to 15 percent while saving $ 4 billion across the country. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, financial sources said a consortium of banks plans to sign a $ 1.6 billion credit agreement for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said Soviet officials hope to use the money to improve the nation's food processing and consumer goods industries. <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s largest commercial bank, is heading the consortium involved in the agreement, which would be the biggest Western credit line ever to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Scientists have calculated that inefficiency and waste in Soviet agriculture account for $ 96 billion a year, <PERSON> Khmelkov </PERSON> said. `` That's half the cost of what is grown in the fields and farms,'' he said. The government spends $ 105 billion a year to keep the prices of milk, meat, bread and other food products low in keeping with long-term policies officials have espoused as proof of the superiority of their economic system. <PERSON> Khmelkov </PERSON> said his enterprise produces beef costing $ 2.50 a pound but it is sold in stores at government prices 80 cents lower. The economist said it costs other farms twice as much to produce the same amount of meat and the state picks up the difference between the cost of production and the retail price. Nevertheless, some <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> consumers can not afford to buy meat, which is not always available, he said. In addition to considering retail price increases, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been trying to trim the top-heavy management of the state-run agricultural system. The Soviet president also is trying to encourage state farms to give more responsibility to families and small groups of workers, allowing them to earn more money for better work.

 <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was home watching television when a local newscast flashed her photograph on the screen and reported that she had been murdered. A <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> had indeed been killed the previous day. She was from <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, 18 years old and black. Two local television stations illustrated the story by using the ninth-grade school photograph of the <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> who was alive, from <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, 18 _ and white. `` I knew that a <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> had been killed,'' Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` But then the news showed my picture. I did n't know what to do. All I could think was that everybody, my friends and relatives, would think I was dead. `` I called my mom right away. I guess I kind of freaked out.'' <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> was not the only one upset. Friends and relatives began calling her mother, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>, Friday after reading newspaper accounts _ minus the photograph _ of the slaying. `` The phone started ringing at 7 a.m.'' <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. `` I spent the whole morning explaining to people that our <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> was fine.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was so busy making calls that she missed the 5 p.m. newscasts. She sat down to watch the 10 p.m. news. `` I knew it was n't my daughter who was dead, but seeing her picture like that and hearing the story, I was shaking all over,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. She said her daughter's photo accompanied the murder story on two local stations, WIFR and WREX. Spokesmen for both channels confirmed that they had used the wrong photograph. The two stations apologized for the error during Tuesday newscasts, Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said officials from <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> High </LOCATION> <LOCATION> School </LOCATION>, where her daughter attended classes, told her they did not release the picture. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Rockford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, said no one from administrative headquarters released the photo either. She speculated that the television stations obtained a school yearbook independently. The real victim was found dead Thursday in a small storage shed behind a <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION> home. Police said the woman, who had been a live-in baby sitter at the home for the last month, was reported missing by her family several weeks ago. <PERSON> Bennie </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, described by police as an acquaintance of the victim, turned himself in Thursday night. He has been charged with first-degree murder.

 An organizer of a marijuana-smuggling ring ordered by a judge to open an AIDS hospice rather than serve years in prison says he's pleased with the sentence, but may have had an easier time behind bars. The sentence issued Tuesday by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, believed to be the first of its kind in the country, calls for <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Prager </PERSON> to operate a hospice in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> that will house at least three AIDS victims. The 41-year-old <PERSON> Prager </PERSON>, who helped open the first AIDS hospice in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and his French-born wife, Sandrine, will act as non-paid resident managers for five years. `` I'm sure ... two or three weeks down the road, when we're in the grip of the struggle, we'll think it may have been easier to have gone to jail,'' said <PERSON> Prager </PERSON>, who had requested the sentence. <PERSON> Prager </PERSON> pleaded guilty in January to conspiracy, possession and importation of marijuana. He could have received up to 15 years in prison and a $ 125,000 fine. The sentence proposal drew criticism from the public, and some people have written letters to newspapers calling it `` outrageous'' and an `` insult to all law-abiding citizens of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>.'' However, it was applauded by advocates of alternative prison sentences, among them a private, non-profit group called Sentencing Options, which helped devise the plan. `` There's not much point in his going to prison,'' director <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauche </PERSON> said. `` He has a lot to offer and society is going to benefit.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who is known for handing down maximum penalities in drug-related cases, said he will impose a jail term if the hospice fails to materialize. `` I am concerned that you do what you say you'll do because ... if you do not do this, I will not hesitate to reconsider this matter,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> told <PERSON> Prager </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Yarmouth </LOCATION> resident. More than 20 others connected with the smuggling operation _ which imported more than 20 tons of marijuana worth $ 83 million through Deer Isle between 1979 and 1981 _ each have been sentenced to up to 10 years in prison. <PERSON> Prager </PERSON>, an art broker described by family and friends as a well-educated, intelligent man who had a few bad years, said he will have the hospice open by the Oct. 1, 1989, deadline imposed by the judge. `` I think we have taken the harder road and I'm hoping that people do realize that we're about to do a lot of very, very hard work,'' he said. `` We're pleased to be able to do this work, but I do n't believe it'll be easy.'' As part of a plea agreement, <PERSON> Prager </PERSON> will forfeit proceeds from the smuggling operation and liquidate his assets, which include a $ 500,000 townhouse in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> apartment worth about $ 200,000, property in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and at least one Swiss bank account, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Groff </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. The assets are estimated to be `` well in excess'' of $ 1 million, <PERSON> Groff </PERSON> said, and the government will receive two-thirds and leave one-third for <PERSON> Prager </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alternatives </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes this is the first time a judge has approved opening an AIDS hospice as an alternative to prison. `` It's a lot more productive than all the jailing we're into,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, office. `` I wish we could be as creative as that for the average offender.''

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON> said today his government is committed to seeking a negotiated settlement to end the war with Moslem guerrillas. <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON> also said he hoped the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election next month will lead to a change in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s policy toward the U.S.-supported guerrillas. `` We hope that the smell of blood of innocent people will no longer be to the liking of the leaders of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Sharq </ORGANIZATION> said during a 90-minute meeting with Western reporters. He made no new offers that might persuade the guerrillas to stop fighting the Soviet-backed Afghan government, but he indicated a preference for making deals with local guerrilla commanders inside the country rather than trying to persuade their Pakistani-based leaders to give up the fight. `` If we are not able to have ways of negotiating with all of them, we will have negotiations with some of them,'' the 63-year-old prime minister said `` Those who are sharing the miseries of the people of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will come first.'' The Afghan government has been pursuing a policy of trying to establish what it calls `` coalition governments'' at the provincial level. If successful, this strategy could neutralize _ on a piecemeal basis _ the guerrillas by persuading them to lay down their arms in exchange for local power. The prime minister, whose remarks in <LOCATION> Dari </LOCATION> were translated into English by government officials, urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to stop arming the guerrillas. He dismissed any similarity between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' arming of the guerrrillas and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s resupplying of the Afghan army. He said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has been arming the Afghan government for 35 years. American aid to the guerrillas began in earnest when Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to support the communist government after a coup. Soviet troops started withdrawing from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15 under terms of an agreement reached in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The withdrawal is now half completed, and the remaining Soviet soldiers _ estimated at 50,000 to 60,000 _ are to be gone by Feb. 15, 1989.

 Safety problems that halted production of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons materials expose a `` bad trend'' and a `` sense of complacency'' in the operations of nuclear plants, top <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said today. `` The risks we are facing are serious,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>, deputy assistant energy secretary for safety, health and quality assurance. Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said Tuesday that the government will not be able to manufacture nuclear weapons materials for 2 -LCB- months because of safety problems, but he said that raises no threat to national security. The department had planned to restart one of its three nuclear weapons reactors at its <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> as early as next month, but now does not expect the first of them to reach full operation until January, <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>, interviewed on `` CBS This Morning,'' said the nation's aging nuclear weapons manufacturing plants must remain in operation for another 10 to 15 years while they are being replaced. The <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors began operations in 1954. `` These are the only supplies we have for our national security,'' said <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>. `` We're trying to take measures now before the situation does degrade and we have a serious accident.'' Referring to the shutdown last weekend of the main plutonium processing plant at Rocky Flats in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, because of a radioactive contamination incident, he said, `` The incident of the workers is indicative of a bad trend and we want to stop it before it does result in any off-site release'' of radioactive material. <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON> said the Rocky Flats facility should be able to restart in about two months. The top <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anson </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' that some contractors and department managers have become so accustomed to the old equipment that `` they do n't stop long enough to see what was the cause'' of minor problems `` We think there is a sense of complacency in the department,'' <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said. All three of the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> reactors have been closed down for maintenance and safety checks amid a wave of publicity about lax safety precautions. The department, said <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, `` will not operate unsafe reactors. We will meet the defense needs of this country in a safe manner and an environmentally sensitive manner.'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>'s deputy, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON>, outlined what he called a `` phased restart.'' It will include supervision by a senior manager at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and a review of safety at various milestones during the four weeks officials say will be needed to take the first reactor to full power. <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> said he foresaw no shortage of tritium, one of two nuclear weapons materials produced at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The facility, the only nuclear weapons plant on active status, also produces plutonium, which does not decay as quickly as tritium and is said to be in abundant supply. `` We are comfortable that <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> will operate at a sufficient level to meet the tritium needs of the future,'' <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> said. The news conference was called to defuse criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> not only over the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plant in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, but also over radioactive contamination at the Rocky Flats plant northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and over allegedly lax security at weapons laboratories in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. In related developments Tuesday: _ President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> voiced concern about the nuclear plant safety problem during a meeting with top <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> officials, chief of staff <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> said <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying the administration is `` committed to making sure that all safety precautions are taken and that all rules and regulations be followed.'' _ The chairman of E.I du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> under contract for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, reacted angrily to claims that company employees had a lax attitude toward safety. R.E. <PERSON> Heckert </PERSON> said du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> was `` caught in a political cross-fire'' between the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. _ Officials said the shutdown of the Rocky Flats' main plutonium processing plant on Saturday virtually halted production at the nuclear weapons plant _ Congressional researchers said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has admitted hundreds of visitors from communist and nuclear-sensitive nations into its nuclear weapons labs at <LOCATION> Sandia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION> without required security checks _ Sen <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said the cost of cleaning up radioactive and hazardous waste at <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nuclear facilities is estimated at $ 150 billion to $ 175 billion. He cited estimates by <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. `` It will take 20 years, even if we know how to do the cleanup,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said, adding that `` safety and health matters too often took a back seat'' to production goals at the department's nuclear facilities It was not clear how <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, made the estimate. _ A report issued at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plant estimated that cleaning up the facility could cost as much as $ 6.5 billion The estimate, by the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, was markedly higher than an earlier <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> forecast of $ 285 million for cleanup of 69 waste sites at the plant. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> and <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> said most recent criticism of the department had originated within the department itself during a safety and environmental campaign started in early 1985. `` Our facilities are safer today than they were four years ago,'' said <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>. But `` much more needs to be done.'' <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 30 that he hoped to restart one of the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> facilities, the P-reactor, within 30 to 45 days.

 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> invited <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> today to create an international scientific group to begin space research at a controversial radar station in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He said Soviet scientists were ready to establish contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION>, Scientific and Cultural Organization to carry out `` peaceful research at an absolutely peaceful radar installation'' at <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>, 2,000 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In a speech Sept. 16, Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed that a center for international cooperation in the exploration of space be set up at the radar station. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty it signed with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would permit the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> station to be used for space tracking, but contends that evidence suggests it actually is being used for missile detection and warning, a violation of the ABM treaty. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, on the last day of a three-day official visit to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, spoke to a special session of <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>'s governing Executive Board. He said the most important problem facing the 158-nation Paris-based organization is to prevent the scientific and technological revolution from alienating people who depend on it to improve their lives.

<HEAD>Students End Occupation at Goddard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLAINFIELD, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A handful of students who occupied an administration building at <ORGANIZATION> Goddard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> for nearly two days have ended their vigil after narrowing a 26-item list of wide-ranging demands to one. The three remaining students ended their blockade on the second floor of the Community Center on Tuesday. Seven others had left the building Monday night. The final demand agreed to before the protesters ended their occupation was that the college fully disclose its financial records, something Goddard President <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON> said was already in effect. `` It's a funny issue to have as an issue,'' he said. `` Everybody knows they can come to me for that information. I'm glad it was n't ending homelessness in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>; that would have been harder to do. After the barricades were removed Tuesday, about 100 students and faculty met to discuss the issues that had been raised by the protesters, which ranged from school issues such as increasing student participation in the college's administration to more global concerns, such as freeing South African activist <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and ending homelessness in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Before the barricades were removed, <PERSON> Zenzile </PERSON> <PERSON> Madikinea </PERSON>, a South African and former Goddard student who organized the protest with student <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, cried softly. `` Because we are non-violent and do n't want anybody to get hurt, we are coming down to press all our demands. We care about the students and respect the process,'' he said. <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, composed of students and faculty, would decide whether any punitive action would be taken against the students.

<TEXT>
 Call it rapprochement. Call it detente. Call it peace, however fleeting. After weeks in the national spotlight, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> now admits he actually finds the press likable. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s new posture with the media assumes that reporters are merely a bit misguided, not necessarily evil, a notion he expanded on Tuesday as he posed for a photo opportunity at an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> pumpkin stand. The Republican vice presidential nominee bought his press entourage a bushel of apples, bit into one and admonished: `` Go eat them. Enjoy it. Change your attitude.'' The stand was owned by one <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Custer </PERSON>. Not to let an opportunity slip, one reporter noted to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> that it appeared he was at <PERSON> Custer </PERSON>'s Last Stand. The senator laughed. `` Why not? We were at <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION> earlier,'' said another, a reference to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s remark to a <LOCATION> Napoleon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, rally that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would n't come there because he `` does n't want to meet his <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION>.'' Such repartee with the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator was missing from early weeks of his campaign, when the candidate was constantly peppered with questions about his military service, academic record and personal life. Those questions do pop up from time to time, as do questions about polls indicating that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is a drag on the ticket. And indeed, when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> ventured into the back of his plane to see reporters recently, he met some of his toughest questions to date about his parents' support in the past of the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> society. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> testily denounced the question as `` irrelevant.'' When the reporter persisted, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> finally told him, `` You're irrelevant. But more often than not, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been casual and relaxed around the press since his debate with <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, his Democratic counterpart. There have been frequent impromptu visits to the back of the plane for on-the-record chats and good-natured banter with the regulars who travel with him. There have n't been any formal news conferences since Sept. 15. They are not <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s best format _ he often makes gaffes _ and they clearly do n't fit in with the campaign strategy. `` We've had news conferences, not as much as the press would like,'' concedes <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s press secretary. `` But our strategy is not to satisfy the press as much as it is to get our message out.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> likes to tell crowds he is a former newspaperman. He once held a management position at his father's <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, newspaper. But he has made no secret of the fact that he feels he has been treated unfairly by the press since he became the nominee. One reporter who rode on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s campaign plane for the first time Tuesday seemed stunned that the senator and his press corps were not at war with each other in the air. `` You did n't realize what good friends I had until you got on, did you?'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, gesturing round the plane and smiling broadly. `` Wonderful people here. Glowing reports they write about me all the time. It's the other people that are n't here, they're the ones that write all those bad things.'' With perhaps a bit more of his tongue in his cheek, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> explained his seemingly new attitude to the press by saying, `` I figured out you were n't all that bad.'' `` I just did n't realize what a friendly bunch of people you are. The more I get to know you, the more I really like you,'' he told a group of reporters at a <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wert </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, stop. Since the debate, moreover, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has displayed a fascination with `` spin,'' the time-honored practice of political aides' selling reporters their favorable interpretation of a particular development `` I am Dr. Spin and I want you all to report that,' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told the traveling press. `` I do n't want anybody to say, well, here's what some campaign aide said about it You ask me and I'll give you the answer.'' During the weekend, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> complained to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> about anonymous <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> staffers quoted in news reports as saying the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee was a liability and he did not perform well in the debate, according to campaign sources, who requested anonymity. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says his new lightheartedness with reporters comes because he has simply decided to enjoy his last few weeks on the campaign trail. `` We are going to have a great deal of fun these last few weeks,'' he said, `` and I am just sort of sitting back and, as they say, let her rip.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief today said ethnic rallies that ignited nationwide unrest are an example of couterrevolutionary tendencies running rampant in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, state-run media reported. `` What the counterrevolution in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> has been trying to do -LRB- constitutes -RRB- ... the most brutal threat to socialism in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> told the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Politburos </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, an autonomous province in the republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. But he added, `` Anti-socialist, and if you want, counterrevolutionary tendencies, have grown in all of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> so that the <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> reality, in comparison, is not a particularly isolated phenomenon.'' <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, an ethnic Croat, spoke in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. His comments were reported by the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency. At a meeting Tuesday, <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, defended the <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> rallies and vowed he would assign blame for the national crisis during a meeting of national leaders next week. But <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> was criticized for failing to condemn calls for violent solutions to tensions in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, where Serbs claim discrimination by the Albanian majority. During the <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Serbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, members demanded three <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> communists be ousted from the national <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for failing to resolve tensions. The <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> gatherings were key preludes to the crucial national <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> gathering Monday. The growing friction between ethnic groups and general dissatisfaction with the nation's economy has led to widespread public protests, strikes and political manuevering that add up to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s most serious social unrest since World War II. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, hailed by Serbs as the heir apparent to the late President <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, is expected to have a major showdown with national party leaders over the <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> dispute and the broader protests over <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s economy. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> on Tuesday defended the nationalist rallies but said they should not become a regular practice. The meeting was broadcast on state radio and television in a break with usual practice. He said Monday's meeting should be `` a confrontation with the responsibility for the crisis.'' The Serbian <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has more than 100 members, decided with only six negative votes to demand dismissals of two ethnic Albanians and one Slav from their <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> party posts and their expulsion from the national <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. One of the three is <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>, an ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> and former party chief in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, where predominantly Moslem Albanians make up 90 percent of the population. Most Slavs who live in the province _ Serbs and Montenegrins _ are <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> consists of six republics and two autonomous provinces, each with its own government and party structure. The autonomous provinces, <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>, are part of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> but not fully subject to its control. The decentralized system of government and collective federal presidency were devised in <LOCATION> Tito </LOCATION>'s 1974 constitution to prevent one republic from gaining sway over the others, but has resulted in an ineffective government. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> has said broad personnel changes would be made during Monday's national party meeting. Ethnic tension in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> has increased sharply in recent weeks because of rallies by hundreds of thousands of Serbian nationalists. Albanians deny discrimination against Slavs and say the problems are economic. <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sefcet </PERSON>, an ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> member of the Serbian <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, on Tuesday sharply criticized such rally chants as `` We want arms'' and the calls for <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>'s death. `` These are anti-socialist slogans which do not meet with sharp condemnation, except for sharp condemnation by all nations and nationalities'' in regions outside <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, he said. `` One should, on the spot, unmask all forces standing behind'' the slogans, he said in apparent criticism of <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> radio reported three more rallies Tuesday. It said 50,000 people demonstrated at <LOCATION> Leskovac </LOCATION>, 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>; 20,000 massed at nearby <LOCATION> Cuprija </LOCATION> and another large rally was reported at <LOCATION> Valjevo </LOCATION>, 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Some 200,000 commuters were derailed this morning when a broken water main flooded subway tunnels and closed some streets around a key midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> subway hub, officials said. Some sections of the subway system were under eight feet of water and the water was lapping over some platforms, said <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Slovak </PERSON>. The break in the 36-inch main was reported at 2 a.m., said <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Holstein </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the city <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION>. It took about five hours for city crews to close three water mains to isolate the break. `` It's no longer gushing in the area,'' <PERSON> Holstein </PERSON> said. `` It's still very wet. The broken main carries water into smaller distribution mains, which connect to buildings. <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Previdi </PERSON> said some 200,000 commuters were affected as train service on some lines was halted for up to four hours before the trains could be rerouted. <PERSON> Holstein </PERSON> said water service was expected to be restored to the affected areas _ between <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eighth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> and 56th and 60th streets, near the southwest corner of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> _ within `` a matter of hours.'' The size of the actual break and its cause had not yet been determined, she said. `` Subway vibrations, heavy traffic, a number of factors can affect water mains in addition to age or freezing weather, so it's very unclear what would have caused this,'' she said Motorists were advised to avoid the area, said a police spokesman, Sgt. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>.

 Saving historic church buildings is less important than keeping the parish life within them strong, Cardinal <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> said in defense of a plan to close 43 <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches in the city. <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> predicted Tuesday that parishioners' unhappiness with the planned closings would decrease. `` As people have time to think about this and to consider it, they'll understand that what we're trying to do is to strengthen the life of the parishes, strengthen the presence of the church in the city,'' he said. `` That's always been our objective. We ca n't confuse that with simply maintaining a lot of great big buildings that once served a purpose but today are not needed.'' A preservationist said many of the structures deserved to be saved as landmarks, even if not as houses of worship. `` I would say throughout the Northeast and the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, there is a widespread recognition that the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> especially can not afford to keep that number of buildings,'' said <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiala </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fiala </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> director of the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION>, and other representatives of local, state and federal preservation agencies, met in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> on Monday to discuss the historic significance of churches the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> plans to close. `` Some of these are very great energy-using buildings, and the population that supports them has been reduced,'' <PERSON> Fiala </PERSON> said. `` For the large barns of buildings meant to house 4,000 parishioners and that now have 400, it's a real problem.'' As many as half of the 43 threatened churches may be eligible for designation as landmarks under <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION>'s historic landmark ordinance, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Worden </PERSON>, staff director of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s Historic Designation Advisory Board The historic designation would restrict interior and exterior renovations, he said. State and national historic designations are also possible, a status already attained by 10 of the affected buildings. `` It may delay the demolition of the building or its conversion to an alternate use ... but it will not keep their parish alive,'' <PERSON> Fiala </PERSON> said. `` That is something separate and apart from what the designation can achieve. It basically protects the building itself, but it does n't protect what happens inside. That is a local issue.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has provided 142 aircraft to other countries over the last decade for the interception and eradication of illegal drugs, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today. More than half went to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` Facing growing violence from cocaine traffickers in their own countries, the governments of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are fighting back,'' the department said in a statement. These countries are building rural mobile police units, eradicating coca plantations and looking for new crops for peasant growers, it said. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is working with a number of Latin American governments to build up their own capabilities for eradication and interdiction,'' the statement issued by the press office said. `` We are committed to helping these governments and will continue to provide training and equipment.'' Two years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> required that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airplanes and helicopters used on anti-drug missions remain udner <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ownership. The statement issued today was in response to inquires prompted by an account by the <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> news service. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said on Tuesday that <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> had mounted machine guns on six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters under a drug-fighting contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> while <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> have hired <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> civilian pilots. Americans are flying five helicopters in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and two aircraft to spray fields in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, the officials said. The disclosure followed the <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> story that said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had amassed a force of 150 aircraft and planned to use <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> civilian pilots to fly armed missions against drug traders in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Department spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> called the story an `` exaggeration.'' She and <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> then disclosed the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contract with <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and the hiring of civilian pilots in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> But Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the 29 helicopters and planes acquired on order to combat drugs `` are not for combat. They are not used for aggressive actions like bombing airstrips or cocaine laboratories. I am not aware of plans for their future use in that regard.'' In all, 16 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters and planes are in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries to combat drugs, the officials said. But except for the six helicopters in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, none has weapons mounted aboard, Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. She said, however, that local law enforcement agents may be carrying weapons aboard those aircraft. The <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> story identified <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of state for international narcotics matters, as `` commander in chief of the air wing.'' Aides to Mrs. <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON> said she was attending an international drug conference in The Hague that was not open to the press and could not be reached for comment. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> called the story `` an exaggeration and an overdramatization of the congressional mandated role of the department'' in combating drugs. The six helicopters in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> are <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> models, each one able to carry a crew of three and eight passengers. The M60 machine guns are mounted in doorways on swivels. Ms. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> of the international narcotics office said <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> armed the helicopters under a contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. In all, she said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has title to 29 helicopters and planes in the anti-drug wing, not the 150 reported by <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>. Of these, Ms. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said, five <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> helicopters have been delivered to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, six <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> helicopters to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, a C123 Cargo plane to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, two agricultural spray planes to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and two to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. She said the two in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> may be flown by American civilians, as well, but she was not certain. Two other planes are used for training, while the others in the wing of 29 will be delivered later, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized $ 55 million for the operation. Under a 1986 law, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must maintain title to the planes. Previously, American planes would be turned over to other countries to use in their campaigns against narcotics.

 Immigration agents say they found 91 people crammed inside a stuffy, three-bedroom house and garage believed to be used by smugglers of illegal aliens to imprison those who could n't pay the smuggling fee. All of the people were arrested, including 14 booked for investigation of taking money from illegal immigrants in exchange for transporting them into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, authorities said Tuesday. The immigrants, found Sunday, were being held captive because they had not paid the smugglers their passage fee of $ 250 to $ 500 each, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, an assistant district director of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. People stood by entrances to keep the aliens from escaping, he said. He declined to given more details about the smuggling ring and his operations. Nearly all the immigrants were Mexican men, but a young family was among those taken away in the Sunday morning raid, authorities and witnesses said. `` What really broke my heart was to see what appeared to be a mother, a father and three kids,'' said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gimondo </PERSON>, a neighbor who watched the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> raid. `` One kid was about 3 to 6 months old and -LRB- the mother -RRB- had him cuddled in a blanket.

 The military says it got just one false positive result in testing more than 135,000 recruits for the AIDS virus, lending support to those who favor widespread screening for the disease. The armed forces, which routinely screen all recruits for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, had only one false positive in checking young men and women from areas where the AIDS virus is rare. The results of the military testing program are to be published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The risk of false positive results is often cited as an argument against routinely screening people at low risk of AIDS infection, such as marriage license applicants. Some have suggested that the false positives might actually outnumber those who are truly infected with HIV, the AIDS virus. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redfield </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> said the military program dispels that `` myth'' by showing that AIDS testing can be performed quickly, cheaply and accurately. The test costs the government $ 3 per person, and the results are available within three days. Military researchers said not all AIDS testing may be as accurate and efficient as theirs. `` Clearly, people who perform the test poorly will have bad results,'' <PERSON> Redfield </PERSON> said. `` I would like Americans to ask why the young men and women in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> get an early diagnosis for a treatable, preventable disease, when they ca n't. The answer is there has been no leadership in the medical community to provide that right to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' One critic of widespread testing, Dr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Miike </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION>, said the report shows that `` you can get this phenomenally high accuracy rate, which probably surpasses every other test there is.'' `` But I'm not worried about them,'' he said. `` I'm worried about labs that advertise, ` Come get your HIV test.' I get calls from people who say they are the victims of false positives.'' `` The question is not how well the best laboratories can do,'' added Dr. <PERSON> Klemens </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` The issue is how well most laboratories are performing, whether they will maintain this performance and whether it is good enough.'' Many experts agree that AIDS testing is sufficiently accurate when used among people who are at increased risk of the disease, such as homosexual men or drug addicts. To learn how well it works among people at low risk, military researchers reviewed 20 months of testing of recruits from rural parts of 36 states with low AIDS rates. Their initial check of the blood of 135,187 recruits showed that 15 were infected. When they re-examined the blood of these 15 with four different tests, they found that one of them was actually free of the AIDS virus. The 14 others were in fact infected. During the study, the HIV infection rate among the total 1.2 million recruits was 1.48 per 1,000 people. The military doctors said their latest work suggests that among these people, there was one false positive result for every 200 truly positive ones. <PERSON> Redfield </PERSON> said the military testing has improved, and false positives are now probably about one in 1 million. In the military program, blood is initially screened with a quick, easy test called an <PERSON> ELISA </PERSON>. If it's found to be positive for the virus, it's checked again with the same test. All blood that turns up positive in both tests is re-examined with a more time-consuming test called a Western blot. If that shows the blood to be infected, a new sample is drawn from the recruit. If this also turns out to be positive on a Western blot, the recruit is considered to be infected with the AIDS virus. <PERSON> Redfield </PERSON> said he believes that AIDS testing should be routinely performed in venereal disease clinics, in drug addiction programs, during pregnancy exams and when people are admitted to hospitals.

 The five veteran astronauts who flew Discovery into space say the most anxious moments of their nearly flawless flight came during liftoff, a `` very long 8 -LCB- minutes'' as they remembered the fate of the Challenger. Pilot <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> said Tuesday that although he had flown before, he still was `` a bit taken aback'' by the power of the rockets that thrust the shuttle into orbit Sept. 29. `` It was a very, very long 8 -LCB- minutes'' until the main engine cut off, <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> said during the crew's first post-flight news conference at the Johnson Space Center. `` I think we all felt that way.'' `` I'm sure we were all thinking, to some degree, about the fact that the last time this had been attempted, it was n't successful. You never forget that,'' he said. The Challenger explosion, which occurred 73 seconds after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986, and killed all seven astronauts aboard, was blamed on a faulty booster rocket. The rockets were redesigned and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials have found no damage in the new boosters. Despite the anxious moments, Discovery's astronauts praised the shuttle's performance and its success in putting Americans back into space. `` We can look back on a flight that as far as I'm concerned was picture perfect,'' said Discovery commander <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>, who announced the mission would be his last. <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain, said he is considering what he will do next, but said he has not resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think we have any ghosts hovering above us anymore,'' <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> said, referring to doubts cast on the space agency because of the Challenger explosion. During an appearance today on `` CBS This Morning,'' <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> was asked how <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> was changed by the Discovery mission. `` I think the main changes we've seen within <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> are a commitment to quality, a commitment to safety that we did n't have quite as much emphasis on prior to the Challenger accident and an increase in communications between all the elements of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> said. During the four-day mission, <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>, <PERSON> Covey </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lounge </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> `` Pinky'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> deployed a $ 100 million communications satellite, tested shuttle systems and conducted 11 experiments before landing at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, on Oct. 3. Although a detailed account of the mission showed a few minor problems, including trouble with a cooling system, the only complaint the astronauts had Tuesday concerned the bulky pressure suits worn during launch and landing. While watching a 20-minute film about the flight that included shots of the astronauts getting into the 75-pound suits before landing, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said, `` It hurts just to watch it.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said that although the suits, which are part of a new escape system, are `` pretty uncomfortable,'' a few modifications such as a better fan and a less bulky harness could improve them. During the mission, Discovery's crew members broadcast an emotional message in memory of the seven Challenger astronauts while a camera on the shuttle showed a view of the Earth. <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON>, who came up with the memorial, said he wanted those on the ground to see the pictures of Earth to help understand why others want to travel in space. `` I thought at that time we were really linked closely together,'' he said. `` I felt a lot closer -LRB- to the Challenger victims -RRB- then than maybe ever before. We really wanted to show the world that we were standing up there for them and their sacrifice was n't in vain.''

<HEAD>Norway's Violation Of Export Rules Damaged NATO Security</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s defense chief and one of its top computer engineers testified that the sale of Norwegian technology to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> undermined <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> security. Gen. <PERSON> Vigleik </PERSON> <PERSON> Eide </PERSON> said Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Kongsberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vaapenfabrikk </ORGANIZATION>, in a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, exported computerized control systems for milling machinery that allowed the Soviets to speed up their production of silent submarine propellers. The general said the state-of-the art technology would make it more difficult to detect the vessels. He made the statements at the trial of <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, a Briton who was the sales manager at <ORGANIZATION> Kongsberg </ORGANIZATION> and who signed the contracts that violated Western export regulations to East bloc countries. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, who has lived in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> since 1975, pleaded innocent to charges of lying on the export licence application for the sale. He argued that the sale, completed between 1983 and 1985, was a collective decision by the company. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, 50, faces a maximum 2 -LCB- - year prison term if convicted <PERSON> Eide </PERSON> said the technology enabled the Soviets `` to more quickly equip old and new submariness with such propellers. From 1984 to 1987 the Soviets produced 50 propellers with low noise level. `` This weakened our possibilities of detecting subs and reduced our capability of drawing the right military conclusions in times of crisis. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s security was damaged,'' <PERSON> Eide </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and of the Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multinational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, which regulates trade with the Soviet bloc. The Norwegian-Japanese joint venture involved the export of milling machinery with nine axes, which violated <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> regulations that only allowed export of two-axes machine tools. <PERSON> Oeyvind </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjoerke </PERSON>, who developed high-tech data systems for the Norwegian company, told the court he knew the sale violated <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> rules and that he discussed it with the company employees. But <PERSON> Bjoerke </PERSON> said the Soviets could have acquired similar technology from other sources. `` They would not have gotten the very best equipment, but other equipment would not have prevented them from producing the silent propellers they needed. They may just have needed a little more time,'' he said. When the <LOCATION> Toshiba-Kongsberg </LOCATION> deal was disclosed last year it put a strain on U.S.-Norwegian relations, and Prime Minister <PERSON> Gro </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlem </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> apologized to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. At the time of the sale, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> had no law to punish those who violated <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> rules, but <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> imposed stricter controls last year.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office today sued state and local water resources agencies, seeking to force them to end pollution of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION>. The five-count federal complaint says the agencies have failed to protect water quality and prevent water pollution as required by state and federal law. `` <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> are unique environmental treasures,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>. `` The continued degradation of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> is a national tragedy.'' The suit was filed against the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulation </ORGANIZATION> and the heads of those agencies. <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said the lawsuit seeks to stop water pollution throughout the <LOCATION> Kissimmee-Okeechobee-Everglades </LOCATION> water system, since pollution gathered by the system ends up in a national park and a national wildlife refuge. <PERSON> Okeechobee </PERSON>, the nation's largest fresh-water lake outside of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, has for years been receiving pollution, much of it in the form of nutrient-laden runoffs from dairy farms along the <LOCATION> Kissimmee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The river, flowing from south of the <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> area, is a primary source of water for the lake. In turn, water from the lake flows into the <ORGANIZATION> Loxahatchee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>, into Everglades National Park and to the water-conservation areas that recharge the <LOCATION> Biscayne </LOCATION> aquifer, southeastern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s primary water supply. Both state and federal laws are violated by allowing large quantities of polluted water to enter the protected areas, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said. The state and the self-governing water district failed to maintain legal water quality standards, operated pumps without a permit and violated their contracts to supply clean water to the national parks, the suit claims. <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> stressed that the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> park provides sanctuary to rare and endangered species of wildlife, including the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panther, southern bald eagle, woodstork, American crocodile and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sable </LOCATION> sparrow. The park requires low-nutrient, non-polluted water for the survival of the species, he said, adding that without immediate action, `` more and more wetlands will be lost.''

<HEAD>FBI Bows Out of Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has ended its monthlong investigation into allegations of a 1978 baby swap at a rural <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> hospital, saying there was no evidence any federal laws were violated, an agency spokesman said. `` We closed our case,'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` Preliminary investigation failed to establish that there was a violation of federal criminal statutes.'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> declined to give details of the inquiry. The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> couple who sought the probe, <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON>, can ask state law enforcement officers to investigate, the federal spokesman said, adding, `` That option is always available.'' The Twiggs claim their newborn was stolen at <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wauchula </LOCATION> nearly 10 years ago. Mrs. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> maintains that she gave birth to a healthy girl, but hospital workers sent her home with a sickly child, then altered records to hide the swap. The couple say genetic blood tests this summer revealed that <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON>, the child they raised, was not their real daughter. <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON> suffered from a heart defect and died following surgery Aug. 23, never knowing that doubts had been raised about her parentage. Last month, the Twiggs filed a $ 100 million suit against the hospital and some of its employees and persuaded the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to investigate to see if federal kidnapping laws had been violated. Records show that during its probe the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> subpoenaed documents from the hospital, and interviewed the Twiggs. They also talked with the father of a <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> girl who the Twiggs claim was the only other white girl born at Hardee Memorial during the time Mrs. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> gave birth. The girl has not been identified to protect her from publicity. <PERSON> LaVonna </PERSON> <PERSON> Vice </PERSON>, one of the lawyers representing the <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON>, said she does n't know why the federal investigation ended, but speculated that it might show the child the Twiggs claim was stolen was not taken out of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Federal kidnapping law generally applies to victims taken across state line. However, the law also states that keeping a victim more than a day creates `` a rebuttal presumption'' that the victim was transferred over state lines. The father of the 9 -LCB- - year-old <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> girl said he does n't know what to think about the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> departure from the case He said he cooperated with the agency and provided them with polygraph tests results showing he knew nothing about an alleged swap. He claims the Twiggs, of <LOCATION> Langhorne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, are wrong about his daughter's identity

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> pleaded with his colleagues today to complete work quickly on the $ 2.6 billion drug bill, and restrain themselves from trying to be `` the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> in the drug war.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, indicated that Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers have so far been unable to try to pare down the more than 100 amendments that may be Meetings were continuing, but it was uncertain whether the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would begin debate on the election-year bill today. Speaking on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> cautioned senators against introducing amendments aimed at `` trying to indicate who can be the toughest, who can be the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> in the drug war. `` We can all be tough, but we've got a good tough bill,'' he said. The legislation would provide additional federal money for treatment programs, new law enforcement officers and prisons. It also would allow capital punishment for certain drug offenders who commit murder, and toughen penalties for drug dealers who sell their wares to children. The wide-ranging measure would distribute 60 percent of its money to prevention and treatment programs, and 40 percent to law enforcement. Even though the legislation is the joint product of Democrats and Republicans, there are some lawmakers who want to strengthen it, others who want to water it down and still others who wish to attach unrelated language to it because it could be the last bill <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passes this year. Senators are ready to introduce amendments that would strip the death penalty provision from the measure, limit the ability of prisoners to appeal their sentences on technical grounds, permit courts to accept some illegally seized evidence and force states to conduct drug tests on drivers license applicants. Other amendments would apply sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and require containers of alcohol to carry warning labels. By some counts, there are more than 100 amendments waiting in the wings. The clock is a factor because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is hoping to adjourn for the year at week's end. For the last several days, some senators and their aides have been trying to see if there is any way to limit the number of amendments that would be offered. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed a strong version of the bill Sept. 22 containing the death penalty, but bearing many other tough proposals the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill lacks. One important provision that is absent from both is a mechanism for paying for the programs created in the bill. Even though $ 1.4 billion is supposed to be spent in fiscal year 1989 _ which began Oct. 1 _ legislators say the government only has $ 450 million left in its coffers. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has so far voted down efforts to raise taxes or cut other spending programs to provide the missing $ 950 million. Even if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passes a bill, <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators will have to agree to a compromise version before it can be sent to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for his signature.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> today appointed a new government after the premier and his Cabinet resigned in a shake-up expected to slow the pace of reform. <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> appointed a new 20-member government, including <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> to replace <PERSON> Lubomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Strougal </PERSON> as the federal premier, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The appointments amounted to a rubber stamp of selections made Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Strougal </PERSON>, a key advocate of speedy economic and social reform, was premier for 18 years. He resigned Monday during a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and also gave up his seat on the party's ruling Politburo <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, 62, was premier of the <LOCATION> Czech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, one of the nation's two republics. He is expected to be less insistent on speedy reform than <PERSON> Strougal </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Czech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s Parliament today chose <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitra </PERSON> to replace <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> as the republic's premier, <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said. The new government requires approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, scheduled to meet in November. It was not immediately clear what became of a caretaker government that was appointed Tuesday. Speeches published after the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting made clear that party leaders favor reforms but resist radical changes in the economy, such as tampering with the socialist linchpin _ central planning. Warning of the potential for high inflation and unemployment under rapid reform, the leadership backed personnel changes aimed at pursuing a slower road to restructuring than that of the Soviets. <PERSON> Strougal </PERSON>, 63, was known to have championed thorough economic reform similar to those being carried out in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Strougal </PERSON>'s plans for innovative changes were watered down by party conservatives. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>'s main advantage appears to be that in the eyes of many he is not associated with the brutal suppression that occurred during the so-called `` crisis years'' of 1968-69 when then-party chief <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was purged in the wake of a Soviet-led invasion. Party chief <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, chief ideologist <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fojtik </PERSON>, and a resolution published Tuesday made it clear that political change like that in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been ruled out for some time to come. <PERSON> Fojtik </PERSON> denounced the `` radicalism'' of unidentified people in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, who are `` calling for a drastic reform with bankruptcies and unemployment, rapid growth of prices of foodstuffs, rents and of inflation.'' <PERSON> Fojtik </PERSON> told reporters, `` We put emphasis on the leading role of the Communist Party of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in carrying out the restructuring process. `` The economic reform is aimed at strengthening socialist ownership relations,'' said <PERSON> Fojtik </PERSON>. As he met reporters, <PERSON> Fojtik </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Strougal </PERSON> does not feel healthy, is tired and `` is not really able to master the many difficult task'' of premiership. <PERSON> Fojtik </PERSON> indicated that <PERSON> Strougal </PERSON> left the political scene in anger, saying he will not even head the caretaker government. <PERSON> Fojtik </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> also stressed that despite some cautious opening up in the arts, the party remains firmly opposed to political liberalization, let alone the recognition of dissident and nonconformist political and ecological groups. Without naming countries, the ideologist, who took over the party portfolio from hard-line Politburo member <PERSON> Vasil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilak </PERSON>, now in charge of foreign policy, said <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> leaders are discouraged and in fact appalled by reform setbacks in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fojtik </PERSON> outlined some government changes Tuesday. He said <PERSON> Jaromir </PERSON> <PERSON> Johanes </PERSON>, first deputy foreign minister and a former ambasssador to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was nominated to be the new foreign minister, replacing <PERSON> Bohuslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Chnoupek </PERSON>. Five new members, ages 43 to 56, were added to the Central Committee Politburo, and <PERSON> Strougal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Colotka </PERSON> stepped down. <PERSON> Colotka </PERSON> also resigned as premier of the <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION> republic. <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said he was replaced by <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Knotek </PERSON>, 52, a newcomer to the Politburo.

 Arson investigators probed the third fire in less than three years at the downtown Central Library, where hundreds of thousands of books were destroyed in two 1986 arson blazes. Because the building is undergoing extensive renovation, no books were in the library when the fire broke out Tuesday. However, authorities feared that smoke from the basement blaze may have again damaged the structure's huge murals. As firefighters wearing air tanks vented smoke from the 62-year-old library, an arson investigator would say only that the blaze was under investigation. `` Three times is a little hard to believe,'' said <PERSON> Librarian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, surveying the scene after being summoned by Fire Chief <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>. A passer-by reported the fire at 5:17 p.m. and it was declared extinguished a half-hour later, said Assistant Fire Chief <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. The blaze was confined to paper and wood construction material in an 8-by-25-foot basement room. The work being done in that room involved removal of ceiling tiles containing asbestos. The presence of the hazardous material worried firefighters and prevented library officials from immediately entering afterward to assess the damage. The library has been undergoing a $ 152 million renovation since the 1986 blazes, and res31 65 Stocks \* # \* # \* # \* # \* 801.38 _

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pitched economic nationalism while Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused his rival of adopting a protectionist stance strictly for political gain as the two presidential candidates fine-tuned their strategy for their second and final debate. The vice president, embarking on a weeklong <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> swing highlighted by Thursday's debate in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, told business students at <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposed `` protectionist demagoguery'' during the Democratic primaries. `` But now, for political reasons, he sees advantage in stoking fears about foreign influence,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vowed that the Democratic ticket would be aggressive advocates for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies and workers. `` Together we can build a future where the best products in the world are designed by American minds, built by American hands and produce good profits and good paychecks here on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soil,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor told a partisan crowd at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Later Tuesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s charges: `` I'm for more trade, not less trade. I want to export American products, not American jobs.'' Like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> today, conferring with advisers and doing some last-minute studying of briefing papers for the nationally broadcast, 90-minute debate, set to begin at 9 p.m. EDT at <LOCATION> Pauley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pavilion </LOCATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> campus. Neither candidate planned any campaign appearances today to devote their time to debate preparation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was working with former Deputy Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' stand-in for a mock debate the vice president had Saturday, said press secretary <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was taking a short break this morning to meet with <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>. One final detail for the candidates' face-to-face confrontation was decided Tuesday when the <ORGANIZATION> Bipartisan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Presidential Debates selected the moderator and three questioners. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Compton </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of Newsweek will quiz the candidates, and <ORGANIZATION> Bernard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> will serve as moderator. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> declined an invitation to be a panelist. The first question will go to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will deliver the final closing statement _ a reversal of the first debate, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the commission. The latest polls indicated that the race remains close, raising the political stakes for the prime-time debate. A Gallup Organization survey showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 49 percent to 43 percent among 1,007 registered voters questioned Friday through Sunday, while a Harris Poll of 1,355 likely voters Thursday through Monday had the lead at only 50 percent to 48 percent. Given the polls' margins of sampling error _ four points for Gallup and three for <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> _ the race appeared virtually even. Among 748 likely voters, Gallup found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ahead 52-41 percent, but the organization stressed the closer result, saying it was too soon to gauge likelihood of voting. As in other polls, Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was seen as having decisively beaten Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in their debate last week. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> on Tuesday to a rousing hometown reception where he delivered some fighting words for his candidacy borrowed from the late President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and Revolutionary War hero <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` We plan on taking some heat but staying in the kitchen. In the end, we'll get the job done. We have just begun to fight,'' the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator told cheering supporters. The crowd erupted when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> proclaimed, `` You're looking at the next vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was traveling to <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, later today where he was expected to talk about his role in co-authoring the 1982 Job Training Partnership Act. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was campaigning this afternoon in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, Ark. The Democratic vice presidential candidate again ridiculed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, noting that the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee has suggested that in his administration the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator would head the drug interdiction effort. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants us to follow <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> into battle,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a rally at a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> union hall on Tuesday. `` I'll tell you, I've been in combat, and I'll pass on that one. `` If <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is serious about being president, why would he choose <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for being vice president?'' While in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowed to crack down on white-collar crime as he told the university's business students he would `` throw the book at insider traders and other white-collar criminals.'' `` They may not carry guns and they may wear fancy suits, but they are a real danger to society, and they should be hit with the maximum penalties of the law,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s most pointed attack, however, was on his rival's protectionist stand `` My opponent needs an issue, and he's willing to scare people to find it,'' the vice president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech at the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> college was interrupted by a Jesuit priest, who was forcibly removed after he shouted his objections to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies. The priest said he was given a citation for criminal trespassing. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in his appearance on a college campus, pledged to restore <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leadership in space and technology and as a result see the nation take the lead in global markets. The Democratic nominee said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket was `` satisfied with today and complacent about tomorrow,'' symbolized by its new theme song, `` Do n't Worry; Be Happy.''

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the nation. Oct. 10 <ORGANIZATION> Kennebec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, on the gas-guzzler boom: Last week, Secretary of Transportation <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> announced that his department had again caved in to the demands of the country's top two automakers and waived fuel economy requirements for 1989 automobiles. Meanwhile, a new poll suggests that 90 percent of the public believes government should require automakers to build more fuel-efficient cars. The survey respondents know something the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> apparently does n't. Oil may be cheap and plentiful at the moment, but the situation ca n't last. So it makes sense to keep producing more fuel-efficient cars, and cutting hazardous air pollution in the bargain. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> are n't doing that. Since the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration signaled its willingness to agree to any figure the big automakers came up with, they've put efficiency on the back burner, strenuously pushing a new generation of `` muscle'' cars, for which they have little foreign competition. That may boost profits in the short term, but makes little sense in the long run _ precisely the condition the government fuel standards were supposed to address.

 Oct. 10 The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on sheltering the homeless: The federal government's benign neglect in evaluating surplus government property that could be suitable for sheltering the homeless has been given a needed jolt by a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. It has been 15 months since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> Homeless Assistance Act, a piece of legislation that has been strangled in part by bureaucratic inaction. Among other things, the act requires federal agencies to turn over buildings and land suitable for sorely needed shelters to local governments and non-profit agencies. Implementation of the act has lagged ludicrously. ... -LRB- The judge -RRB- lamented: `` Pitifully few of the numerous unused federal properties are being evaluated for their suitability to assist the homeless and those that are found to be suitable are not being made available.'' It defies logic that only a dozen surplus federal properties exist across the country as possible shelters for an estimated 3 million homeless Americans.

That said, we feel free to censure the other side of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>. That side is highly political, seemingly paranoid about the supposed danger of religion in public life and overzealous in looking for infringements on so-called free speech. ...

 Oct. 5 <LOCATION> Owatonna </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on the League of Women Voters' withdrawal from presidential debate sponsorship: Hurrah for the League of Women Voters Rather than putting up with another staged event, the League withdrew its sponsorship of the second presidential debate of this campaign. The League's decision is the first honest call of this campaign. Anyone who witnessed the first presidential `` debate'' knows the candidates were more interested in their appearance than the substance of their answers. The League likened the debates to the ever growing list of campaign charades devoid of substance, spontaneity and honest answers to tough questions. We wholeheartedly agree. This campaign has been one staged event after another. Enough is enough. It's time for the candidates to put the issues before their wardrobes. Maybe the League's decision will bring these candidates back into the real world _ not the one their campaign advisers have carefully staged these past few months. Certainly, the voters deserve as much.

Destruction of the ozone layer, which screens out ultraviolet rays that are harmful to health, is too dreadful to contemplate.

But to impose this on fourth generaton bureaucrats, the party functionaries raised by <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> for their limited vision and unlimited loyalty, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> requires unhindered cooperation at the top, unbrooked by opposition. ... Diversity, pluralism, separation and balance of powers, whatever their virtue lower in the hierarchies, still have no place in the summit of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> power.

Its purpose was not clear, unless it was to suggest that teen-agers do n't need _ or do n't deserve _ the minimum wage. It that sounds reasonable, look around at various fast food outlets that employ mostly teen-agers. They are having to pay more than minimum wage just to attract and retain those employees. Through their filibuster, the Republicans reiterated support for their familiar `` trickle down'' theory. In this case, the only thing trickling down was contempt for the least fortunate in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s work force.

<HEAD>Cabinet Minister Suggests Electronic Tags To Reduce Crime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRIGHTON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Cabinet minister in charge of law and order today suggested crime could be reduced by putting electronic tags on people freed on bail and by widening a ban on drinking outdoors. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s crime rate dominated debate on the second day of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s annual convention in the southern coastal resort of <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>. The convention has been marked by massive security. When the governing party last met in <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> in 1984, a bomb planted by the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> killed five people and narrowly missed the prime minister. Government statistics in March indicated a 12 percent increase in muggings and other violent crime in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> last year and an 11 percent increase in sexual offenses. About 3.9 million crimes were reported to police in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> in 1987, up 45,000 from 1986. Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, the Cabinet member in charge of law and order, said the government would attack crime with more police officers, a possible widening of the public drinking ban, and the electronic tagging system. But <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> once again rejected capital punishment, saying `` do n't let's get stuck just in this groove. `` Capital punishment ca n't be the answer to all crime, or even to violent crime in general,'' he said. Capital punishment was abolished in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1969, but an overwhelming majority of <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> delegates raised their hands in favor of its reinstatement in an unofficial convention poll. <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said that if the experiment with electronic tagging works, it could be expanded to monitor the movements of convicted offenders. `` The apparatus is relatively simple,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> explained. `` It looks like an electronic bicycle clip, and it works. ... If this project proves successful then we shall take the idea further.'' <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hattersley </PERSON>, deputy leader of the socialist opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, on Tuesday condemned Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s philosophy of individual self-reliance and her determination to reduce what she calls the dependency culture based on state aid `` The idea that the <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION> are the party of law and order is clearly nonsense,'' <PERSON> Hattersley </PERSON> said. `` The new Tory philosophy openly undermines the rule of law.

 Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said today he was `` not mad at anybody in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign'' but would take a greater role in running his own campaign from now on. `` I am my own handler,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters as he left <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. `` If you have any questions, ask me.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had previously expressed irritation at unidentified <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides who have been quoted anonymously as saying he was a liability to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator complained about the sniping over the weekend to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said there was no animosity between him and top campaign officials. `` I'm not mad at anybody in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign,'' he said. `` I'm going to coordinate with them They're going to suggest things that I say, suggesting that I do, and I'm going to take that under consideration.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he did not anticipate any campaign staff changes, but `` if I can find any of those leakers ... I think there will be staff changes.'' He described his conversation with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> as cordial and said reporters would hear him `` say what's on my mind'' in the future. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> ended a successful Midwestern campaign swing Tuesday with a promise in his home state to keep on fighting. `` We plan on taking some heat but staying in the kitchen. In the end, we'll get the job done. We have just begun to fight,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> shouted as supporters cheered. To the partisan crowd, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator could do no wrong, although <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters mounted a small protest outside the rally site. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has said he expects to be a prime target of the Democrats and that he is happy to be the `` lightning rod'' for the campaign. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> travels to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> today as he makes his way west. But his reception probably wo n't top the one he received here, where supporters cheered wildly as he stood before them and said, `` You're looking at the next vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` Welcome home, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>,'' they shouted as he worked the crowd, shaking hands while a band played `` Back Home In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>.'' The welcome did not extend to reporters traveling with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. The crowd chanted `` Just say no!'' as the press entourage arrived. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> was the scene of one of the more notorious news conferences of the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> campaign as he and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held a rally in <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> the day after the Republican convention. Reporters were booed and denounced with shouts of `` BOR-ing'' as they tried to question <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> about his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> service. Tuesday's campaign events had a vastly more calming tone than that day in August. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> rode through <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> on a winding bus tour through pastoral farm land, attacking Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as soft on crime, one of the Republicans' favorite themes. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was portrayed by speaker after speaker as a `` son of the heartland'' and he told flag-waving crowds that their staunch Midwestern values would be preserved under a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency. `` Right and wrong is at the very core of life in this beloved <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> region that I grew up in and where you live,'' he said. `` The values of this region have not left me.'' He spoke of the importance of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which has 23 electoral votes and is viewed as a swing state in November. And in <LOCATION> Napoleon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> delivered the campaign's response to the Democratic presidential candidate's outrage at the way the <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> ticket was portraying the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> furlough program and the escape of convicted murderer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who attacked a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> couple while on the lam. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had said during the weekend that he resented being portrayed as insensitive to the plight of crime victims, and noted that members of his own family had been victimized in the past. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also noted that people such as <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, who had been sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole, could not be furloughed under current state law. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> took issue with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' defense of what <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said was his `` sorry record of dealing with violent crime.'' `` He has not truly and sincerely owned up to his irresponsible conduct,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said.

 American <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents seized $ 6 million worth of paintings during a reent search of the estate of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' son-in-law in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a senior <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> official said today. <PERSON> Mateo </PERSON> <PERSON> Caparas </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Good Government, told reporters he expects <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities to turn over the paintings to the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government because they know the works of art were bought `` with the Filipino people's money.'' In a related development, <PERSON> Caparas </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, ousted president of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, could still face criminal charges in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> even if he enters a plea bargain with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities and surrenders some of his fortune. But <PERSON> Caparas </PERSON> indicated the goverment of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> may delay filing criminal charges against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> so that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities can procede with their own prosecution of the ousted president. `` Our national interest ... requires that we do not permit our filing of criminal charges here to be used as an excuse by Mr. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to escape his indictment abroad,'' said <PERSON> Caparas </PERSON>, speaking on authority of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. The move followed reports that <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> legal officer <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> recommended <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> be offered a deal under which he would avoid prison by surrendering millions of dollars he allegedly embezzled during his 20-year rule. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has not been indicted. The possible charges concern allegations of the fraudulent purchase of real estate and art objects. <PERSON> Caparas </PERSON> told reporters the paintings recovered in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> were part of the Samuels Collection, which disappeared from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> apartment of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>. Other paintings were recovered in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> after they were allegedly smuggled out of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, a close friend of the Marcoses. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife have lived in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since he was ousted from power in a civilian-military uprising in February 1986. `` I just talked with our lawyer in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and he said that when about 50 agents searched the home of <PERSON> Greggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Araneta </PERSON>, they found paintings belonging to the Samuels Collection,'' <PERSON> Caparas </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Araneta </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Irene </PERSON>, who is <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' daughter, live in <ORGANIZATION> Woodside </ORGANIZATION>, a small community south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Russoniello </PERSON> said a van was used to haul away the paintings, sculptures, Ming Dynasty vases and antique furniture. The raid was carried out by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and customs and <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agents under a search warrant. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> confirmed last week that agents searched the home and other buildings on <PERSON> Araneta </PERSON>'s estate on Thursday. `` We expect that -LRB- paintings -RRB- would be turned over to us like the paintings that were recovered in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Caparas </PERSON> said. `` We have long been saying that those paintings were purchased with the Filipino people's money.'' <PERSON> Caparas </PERSON> said he was leaving for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> today to look into the status of four <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> buildings allegedly owned by the Marcoses and which the commission is trying to recover. The couple has not admitted ownership of the buildings, which are now subject to litigation. <PERSON> Caparas </PERSON> said he expects to be in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for three or four weeks and then will go to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, where his commission is trying to recover billions of dollars in secret bank accounts allegedly belonging to the Marcoses. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> created the commission shortly after she assumed power in February 1986 to recover billions of dollars the deposed president and his family and friends allegedly plundered. Filipino officials have filed 39 civil suits against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to recover $ 96.7 billion. But no criminal charges have been lodged against him in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for fear he might demand his constitutional right to return home to face his accusers in court. Philippine law bars criminal trials in absentia but officials fear his return may spark violence.

 Maoist guerrillas hurled hand grenades into an army dining hall and then opened fire with submachine guns and tossed dynamite, killing 12 soldiers and wiping out the military post, police said. Monday's attack was the worst on the military in the guerrillas' eight-year battle to topple <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s elected government and impose a worker-peasant state based on the teaching of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Mao-Tse Tung In other violence reported Tuesday, police said army troops killed three Shining Path guerrillas and captured four in a clash near <LOCATION> Chilhua </LOCATION>, a village 225 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The clash occurred Friday. In <LOCATION> Huancavelica </LOCATION> state, two guerrillas disguised as soldiers entered the mess hall of a small post near <LOCATION> Ticrapo </LOCATION> and lobbed hand grenades as troopers sat down to supper Monday evening, <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> police told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. A column of 30 Shining Path firing submachine guns and hurling dynamite then swept through the mess hall and post, shooting everyone in sight, according to the report. Police said 12 soldiers were killed and three were seriously wounded. The post was on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Ticrapo </LOCATION>, a village 85 miles west of <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>. Fifteen other soldiers stationed at Ticrapo were patrolling the countryside in search of Shining Path guerrillas when the attack occurred, police said. Guerrillas in the past two years have stepped up direct attacks on the military, which controls most of adjoining <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Huancavelica </LOCATION> states, but Monday's military death toll was the highest in a single action. The heaviest previous military losses also occurred in <LOCATION> Huancavelica </LOCATION> state in February and a year earlier. Ten soldiers were slain in both instances when guerrillas exploded road mines as troop trucks passed.

<TEXT>
 A referendum on <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s pioneering handgun law has provoked a bitter fight between pro-gun forces and the state's political establishment that could turn the tide on the issue nationwide. Voters will decide Nov. 8 whether to keep the tough law passed this spring designed to ban cheap handguns known as Saturday Night Specials. Still smarting from congressional rejection last month of a bill requiring a seven-day waiting period before anyone can obtain a handgun, gun control advocates hope a yes vote in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> will rally their movement and provide encouragement for gun control battles in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> legislatures. The campaign has embroiled the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, state gun clubs, the Roman Catholic church, the black community, most major law enforcement officials and Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> in a struggle characterized by charges of racism and misrepresentation. `` There is a sort of tidal effect that comes and goes on issues like this,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> to Ban Handguns. `` If they -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- lose a couple of battles then they lose a lot of their power.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> has devoted $ 3 million to the repeal effort, outspending the law's supporters by 10-1. `` Either way it goes it's going to have some impacts in other states. If it's lost it does n't mean other states are automatically going to follow suit. We've been successful in blocking other attempts, but it would be an impetus,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant general counsel. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautman </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, charged the referendum has become a `` test of how much money it will take the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> to distort the truth. If we lose in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, it will mean that once again the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s millions won out over common sense.'' The law's supporters are counting on the vigorous support of <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> and other well-known Marylanders. <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> has taped television spots that denounce the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> for interference. Four other states have laws banning cheap handguns _ <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> _ but <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s is unique because it does n't define what constitutes a Saturday Night Special, leaving that task to a nine-member board appointed by the governor. The Handgun Roster Board is required to compile a list of handguns with legitimate recreation and personal security uses that may be sold in the state after Jan. 1, 1990. The law also bans the new breed of mostly plastic guns that ca n't be detected by security devices in airports and courthouses. The board has become the major substantive issue in the debate, with opponents contending it would have authority to outlaw all handguns, a charge supporters say is false. Charges of racism have been leveled against the pro-gun forces, who are appealing to black voters with the argument that banning cheap handguns would deprive the poor of their right to protect themselves against crime. The Most Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricard </PERSON>, a leading black Roman Catholic clergyman in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, described the tactic as `` a poorly veiled attempt to pit blacks against the majority. That's offensive to all citizens. This ugly racist campaign thrust should be ended at once.'' The Catholic church has been criticized for its high-profile support for the law. One pro-gun leader urged parishioners to drop spent bullet cartridges in collection baskets to protest the church's stance. There were no reports of anyone doing so. Among the law-enforcement leaders endorsing the gun ban are Attorney General <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, Secretary of Public Safety <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, the state branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, and associations of state troopers, sheriffs and chiefs of police. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> political consultant directing the repeal campaign, summed up the opposition argument: `` Americans have an inalienable right to self defense ... the right of people to purchase the handgun of their choice. History tells us you lose your rights in increments. This is an increment we intend to oppose.''

 <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> officials say they'll accept a $ 5 million endowment from a <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> hotel owner who threw <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> birthday parties for his employees, concluding he meant them only as a joke. A delegation from the school flew to <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> on Sunday and met with <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>, 58, a onetime <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> hockey player who owns the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino. The trip was prompted by disclosures about <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>'s private collection of Nazi memorabilia, housed at the hotel, and the <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> parties. `` I do n't think the World War II collection that we saw is a problem in itself,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vickrey </PERSON>, associate dean of the university law school. `` The bigger problem is some of <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>'s actions, most notably the <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> parties, which have given the whole collection a sinister context. `` Our delegation seemed to conclude that his motives were unthinking, and that's not good,'' <PERSON> Vickrey </PERSON> said. `` But we were n't able to conclude that he was anti-Semitic or pro-Hitler. The collection includes a portrait of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> `` which has that unfortunate, ` To <PERSON> Ralphie </PERSON>, from Adolf,' on there,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorland </PERSON>, executive assistant to the university's president. <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> explained the fake inscription as a joke, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> also admits hanging an artist's portrait of himself as a Nazi at a <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> party _ `` again as a joke.'' Officials said the university in <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, does n't plan to turn down <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>'s money and wo n't change the name of the <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, formerly the Winter Sports Center. But the university's president, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, added that the university is watching the controversy for any new developments and `` we're keeping our options open. <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> pledged the $ 5 million endowment to benefit the school's hockey program and has already given $ 500,000. Details about the <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> parties and other elements surfaced during an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. In a statement delivered at a news conference last week, the hotel owner said he threw <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> birthday parties this year and in 1986 to boost employee morale at the casino. `` Looking for an excuse, I suggested one with <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON>'s birthday as a theme,'' he said. `` It was n't meant to honor <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>.'' `` I ca n't tell you how much I regret my insensitivity on this point. It was innocent, but it was very, very bad judgment. ... I deeply regret it and apologize for it. ... I despise <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and everything he stood for.'' At one of the <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> parties, <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> handed out T-shirts depicting <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> battle scenes as favors, said <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>. `` He said it was n't the brightest idea he ever had,'' <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said. `` But I do n't think it had anything to do with neo-Nazism. It was just a bad joke ... bad taste.'' In a letter to the Jewish Federation of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> said he now plans to sell his collection of cars and other World War II Axis memorabilia.

 King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> says he wishes <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had sent a delegation to a meeting of Islamic information ministers, the latest <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> overture aimed at easing bitter differences among Moslem nations. Fahd's signal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> came at the opening of the conference attended by information ministers from about 45 Islamic nations. `` I would have wished the Iranian delegation to be with us,'' <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> said in a speech Tuesday. `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is an Islamic country, and deep in my heart I would have loved to see my Iranian brothers here today.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s culture is Persian and most of its people belong to the minority Shiite branch of Islam. Most Arabs belong to the Sunni branch. A leading Islamic spokesman, meanwhile, assailed Western news media for their reporting on Islamic matters. `` The image of the Muslim people in the world has been stereotyped as backward, ignorant, fundamentalist and lacking culture and civilization,'' said <PERSON> Sharifuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pirzada </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is hosting the information minister's conference in this port city on the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Officials said the gathering was aimed at improving the flow of information among Islamic countries and enhancing the image of Islam in the non-Muslim world. Fahd told delegates Islamic countries had to show the world their faith was based on `` peace and stability.'' His gesture to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was the clearest in a series of recent Saudi overtures. It comes as <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> seeks to improve relations with both <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and Western nations after the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The Saudis broke off diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> April 26 after accusing the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> regime of carrying out sabotage, subversion and terrorism against <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and other Arab states. The king's remarks came a week after the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> government executed four saboteurs it said were working on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s behalf. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> condemned the executions and accused <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and other gulf Arab states of producing more oil than the quotas set by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> to drive down oil prices to weaken <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pirzada </PERSON>'s attack on Western news media, delivered in a closed session, was not reported in detail by the official Saudi press agency, but a partial transcript was obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He said the international media are `` mostly unaware of and indifferent to the realities of the Islamic world. `` At times they are actively hostile and indifferent toward our faith, our cultural heritage, our objectives of socio-economic development and our efforts to safeguard our independence,'' he said. <PERSON> Pirzada </PERSON> said news reports from Western agencies, none of which he named, `` either ignore or deliberately distort and undermine the just causes of the Muslims. `` Our faith is villified, our culture sneered at, our difficulties magnified and our peoples, governments and institutions subjected to misrepresentation, ridicule and censure,'' he said.

 A prosecution witness in the divorce-fixing trial of <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> admitted under cross-examination that a lawyer for the other side in the divorce case also did a favor for the judge's daughter. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, a former Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and city cultural affairs commissioner, is accused of giving a city job to the daughter of former state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Hortense </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, in exchange for favorable rulings in the divorce of Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s lover, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` Andy'' <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>. Testimony by Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s law secretary resumed today at federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, with the judge's daughter expected to take the stand later in the day. Under questioning today by Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, the law secretary, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON>, amended his previous testimony about when Mrs. <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s lawyer got an apartment for the judge's daughter. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON> said he did n't remember exactly when the apartment had been obtained, but questioning by defense lawyers left the impression that Mrs. <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s lawyer had done an innocent favor for Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s daughter while the judge was considering issues in the divorce case. `` To the best of my knowledge,'' <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON> said today, the lawyer's help came after `` Justice <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s completing her rulings in the Capassos' case.'' The lawyer, <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Felder </PERSON>, said Tuesday that he helped Miss <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> find an apartment in 1986, by which time the <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> case was `` ancient history.'' <PERSON> Felder </PERSON> is not accused of any wrongdoing. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON> also testified that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> called the judge's private line several times while Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> was deciding whether to cut <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s weekly support payments to his estranged wife. According to the prosecution witness, Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> apparently did not tell lawyers in the divorce trial about the <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> phone calls when the judge offered to excuse herself from the case after a newspaper article revealed that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> had hired the judge's daughter But under cross-examination by Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON> said that Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> readily told him Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> was the mysterious person calling and identifying herself as `` <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'' or `` <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>.'' `` Did she -LRB- the judge -RRB- react in panic when you asked that question?'' asked <PERSON> Feldberg </PERSON>. `` No, not at all,'' said <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON>. `` She reacted in a jocular manner.'' Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> is accused of giving a $ 19,000-a-year city job to <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, who was then 34, shortly after <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> became cultural affairs commissioner in 1983. The prosecution alleges the former beauty queen wanted to get the judge to reduce <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s temporary support payments Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> also did not tell the divorce lawyers that <PERSON> Felder </PERSON> helped <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> obtain an apartment, <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON> testified under questioning by the judge's defense attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldberg </PERSON>. On Sept. 14, 1983, Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> cut <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s weekly temporary alimony and child support payments from $ 1,850 to $ 680 a week.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, claiming he was politically stronger than during his first debate with Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said today he would show Americans `` what my heartbeat is'' when he tangles with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> again Thursday night. The vice president said he was ready for the final nationally broadcast campaign debate, which starts at 9 p.m. EDT Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> campus. `` We do tend to be a little stronger politically these days. But what I want to do is have them -LRB- viewers -RRB- understand what my heartbeat is, what I really care about,'' he told reporters at a breakfast meeting with <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, a Republican supporter. Asked about his goals for the next debate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` It's less statistics ... than it is how I would like to lead this country, where I'd like to see us by the 90s So I want to spell it out in a broader sense this time. Let the others nitpick on all these little numbers.'' He said he would keep portraying <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a liberal. `` He can not run away from his past,'' the vice president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent most of the day working with debate coach <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, the former deputy treasury secretary who played the role of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for the first presidential debate Sept. 25, and studying briefing papers alone. Other debate coaches, including media adviser <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, were arriving later today. The relatively quiet day in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> comes on the heels of a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> appearance Tuesday that was disrupted by a shouting Jesuit priest. The Rev. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bichsel </PERSON>, who works with the homeless in <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, was forcibly removed from the hall by police after he stood up in the audience and yelled out his objections to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies. His words could not be heard clearly over the loud public address system <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was using and the vice president continued speaking. At one point, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stopped and took note of the protester. `` Is n't this a great country. You can run into all kinds of characters in my line of work. This one's ... amazing,'' he said. <PERSON> Bichsel </PERSON> said he was given a citation for criminal trespassing and was released. A police spokesman in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> was unavailable for comment. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued to pound out the anti-crime theme that his advisers have targeted as a vote-getter in the waning weeks of the campaign. But the focus Tuesday was on white-collar crime. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the audience of <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> business students he would `` throw the book at white-collar criminals as hard as we throw it at other criminals.'' `` The fact is that most of the people on Wall Street are honest, hard working people. And beyond that, much of the money made tere is recycled to foundations to help the poor, universities and other worthy causes,'' he said. `` But abuse will rear its ugly head without vigorous law enforcement,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of `` protectionist demagoguery'' because of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' recent statements against foreign ownership of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry. `` For political reasons, he sees advantage in stoking fears about foreign influence,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> charged. `` My opponent needs an issue, and he's willing to scare people to find it,'' he said, accusing his opponent of flip-flopping on the protection issues and being a `` believe-nothing candidate.''

 A contractor has been charged with stealing a police officer's two-story duplex home by demolishing it for its bricks. Police said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> hired a demolition company to tear down and haul away a house for its estimated 30,000 to 40,000 bricks.

<HEAD>Will Yearly Tax Returns Become a Soviet Ritual?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Another Western influence may soon follow rock music and fast food into Soviet society: the ritual of filing annual financial returns and paying a progressive income tax. A pair of economists said in articles published Wednesday that a complete reform of the Soviet tax system is necessary to expose those who have made fortunes in the multibillion dollar black market, and spread income more equitably. `` To search for some kind of scientific approach in our system of taxation is useless,'' Deputy Finance Minister <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Semenov </PERSON> told the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Semenov </PERSON> and economist <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaroshenko </PERSON>, writing in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION>, both said a yearly statement of income and expenditures was essential. <PERSON> Yaroshenko </PERSON> added that the income tax should be made more progressive, as it is in many other countries, to be fairer to poor people. Currently, Soviets pay a flat 10 percent of their income in tax if they make less than $ 320 a month, the average industrial wage. The rate increases a few percentage points for higher incomes. Most taxes are deducted at the work place and workers do n't need to file annual tax returns. `` Declarations of income and expenditures would serve as a means of strong economic and psychological action most of all against the system of organized crime,'' said <PERSON> Yaroshenko </PERSON>. By filling out such forms, illegal millionaires would be making a `` preliminary accusation'' of themselves, he said. Black marketeering and other organized crime saps the economy of more money every year than is paid out in benefits to pensioners, invalids, students, families with many children and orphans, he said. It is so well-organized that it constitutes a `` government within the government,'' he said. The current economic and tax structure hurts the poor, <PERSON> Yaroshenko </PERSON> said. He suggested the government impose more progressive income taxes, and that illegal millionaires be allowed to give their ill-gotten wealth to state-run charities anonymously before filing their financial statements. <PERSON> Yaroshenko </PERSON>'s article was the second published in Pravda in two days to address the effects of economic reforms on the Soviet poor. In an article published Tuesday, a farm economist said increasing food prices would be an unacceptable way to eliminate the $ 105 billion the government pays every year in subsidies. Instead, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>. <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khmelkov </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> must make farming much more efficient. In yet another article printed Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said that in the first half of the year, $ 130,000 was confiscated in the Soviet capital from people illegally trading rubles for hard currencies. But it said police are nowhere near able to control the problem. Western tourists are approached near hotels and tourist sites in large cities by hordes of people offering to exchange money. Such exchanges are illegal and give the Soviets access to goods they can not buy in the official economy. <PERSON> Yaroshenko </PERSON> blamed the pervasiveness of organized crime on the centralized Soviet economy's inability to produce large quantities of high-quality consumer goods. `` Instead of the usual ` sold' and ` bought,' we started to say, ` threw out,' and ` managed to get,''' <PERSON> Yaroshenko </PERSON> said. `` That money is hard to earn has always been normal and natural _ but that it is hard to spend, this is an alarming symptom.'' <PERSON> Semenov </PERSON> said the tax system will be reformed in the early 1990s, when economists also are aiming to implement a comprehensive system of price reform. The government must reduce indirect taxes that are worked into the retail prices of many goods and turn to direct taxes that now make up only 7.5 percent of the national budget, he said. <PERSON> Semenov </PERSON> said some of the heaviest indirect taxes historically have been imposed on light industry and food processing, two areas of the economy Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is urgently trying to reform to provide a better life for Soviet citizens. Taxes significantly raise the retail price of refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, TV sets and tape recorders, he said. The wholesale price of a Volga, the largest standard passenger car produced in the country, is $ 5,460. After indirect taxes are added, however, the final retail price is more than $ 25,600.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> borrowed a phrase from <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to hustle votes for the Republican ticket, urging high school students to participate in the November election to help keep <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` the envy of the world.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was campaigning today in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> as chief surrogate for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> while the vice president prepares for his second and final debate Thursday night with Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. In a speech before students at <ORGANIZATION> Upper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Darby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, a Republican stronghold he last visited late in his 1980 campaign, the president made repeated references to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, and echoed the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator's assertion that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is the wonder of the world But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that unless the nation's youngsters take part in the election, all that he has fought for in the past eight years might be lost. `` I am dedicating myself this year to making sure that this future of hope built on opportunity and traditional values remains open to each of you,'' he said, citing the strong economegrees, although Romanians and foreign visitors say many houses actually are colder than that. The energy decree did not mention any change in the quotas for natural gas, indicating strict limits set last year remained in force. The higher quotas for electricty, while not considerably improving Romanians' living standards _ generally viewed as among the lowest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ were perceived as a sign that the regime of President and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> may fear new public protests at the outset of winter. About 10,000 people marched through the streets of <LOCATION> Brasov </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s second-largest city in November, shouting slogans against the regime and clamoring for `` more food and more heating.'' The protest in <LOCATION> Brasov </LOCATION>, a leading industrial center, was believed to be the largest against the government since the communist takeover in 1947. The comparatively higher power quotas this year might have also been intended to shield <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> from the wave of unrest in neighboring <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> triggered by worsening living conditions and ethnic problems in the <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> nation. Romanians also have suffered from widespread food shortages, and despite official calls for better supplies of meat, cheese and other staples, shortages have worsened, Romanians and Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> said. In July, even bread was hard to find in the capital for a week. White flour, cooking oil, sugar, butter and eggs have been rationed since the early 1980s, but in August and September no sugar rations were distributed. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s centralized economy has been grappling with perennial failures in the past decade to meet plan targets in coal-mining and shortcomings in the operation of coal-fired stations. <PERSON> Scinteia </PERSON> recently has again carried articles complaining about repair delays and poor supply of coal at the stations. Under the measures published Wednesday, electricity consumption beyond assigned quotas will be penalized with up to four times the normal charge. According to the measures, a family of three to four people living in a three-room apartment will be alloted a quota of 47 kilowatt hours in January for lighting and other household needs, which equaled the quota for that month two years ago. An energy-saving decree issued in November, regarded by <LOCATION> Romanians </LOCATION> as beyond the absolute minium they could be expected to endure, had alloted a family just 35 kilowatt hours for that month. Last year, a family of three was allotted 236 cubic meters of natural gas for heating and cooking in January, the coldest month of the winter. In most homes, cooking is done by natural gas. Heating systems in the apartment blocks, where most urban Romanians live, are heated by centrally controlled thermal systems that authorities can turn down to decreed limits.

 Police have impounded a government vehicle loaded with 132 elephant tusks and detained four people, it was reported Wednesday.

An average tusk weighs about 12 pounds, which would put the current market value of 132 tusks at about $ 130,000.

<TEXT>
 At low tide, the beach seems to extend all the way to the submerged wreckage of an American bomber shot down 20 years ago near the lighthouse that unwittingly guided its raid on this industrial port. Residents of nearby villages recall little about the crash and the fate of the crew remains a mystery to them. The local administrator said he wrote a brief report for his superiors but does not know what happened to it. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still seeks to account for 2,393 Americans listed as missing in action in the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> war more than 13 years after it ended. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> say about 400 were airmen lost in crashes in water, whose remains probably never will be recovered. Difficulties even with cases considered most easily resolvable show a hard road lies ahead despite last week's unprecedented joint investigations in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, where 1,757 Americans are missing. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Vietnamese specialists searched in five provinces, visiting crash sites and interviewing villagers about six lost airmen. The six are among 70 `` discrepancy cases'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> should have information on, including cases of men captured but never returned. They retrieved two sets of unidentified remains and some wreckage but it was an arduous task just reaching the sites, which were chosen in part becasue of their nearness to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, the capital. The team trekked across mountainous, leech-infested areas, through monsoon rains and along roads enveloped in blinding dust. Wreckage from a 1968 crash is said to be submerged in a water-filled crater in a rice field at Die Hop village near <LOCATION> Haiphong </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Loi </PERSON>, 50, then the local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, said the villagers put the airman's body in a nylon bag and buried it near the wreckage, but he could not find it now because the land has been planted so often. Wreckage litters rice fields from <LOCATION> Haiphong </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, but only the cores of jet engines remained at two sites visited last week. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hop </PERSON>, 60, said residents stripped all the metal for souvenirs and to make household items after a crash near his village in 1967. He smiled and held up a large rice pot made from the wreckage. At another crash site nearby, young men still were stripping a muddied jet turbine 20 years after the crash, selling the metal for the equivalent of half a cent a pound. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts also surveyed crash sites in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> recently for a planned fourth joint excavation, but reported no progress in obtaining numerous remains the authorities in war-torn <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> claim to have. The project in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was a major breakthrough because many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is withholding information, a suspicion fed by previous refusals of permission for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts to search the countryside. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> demands `` the fullest possible accounting'' of the missing, which requires trust built on progress with the discrepancy cases, said a Western official interviewed in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, who has an important role in the matter. `` What I want most is to get some kind of confidence that we are getting something approaching full disclosure on the discrepancy cases,'' he said, on condition of anonymity. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> see the cooperation as a a step toward diplomatic relations, now blocked by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opposition to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s military occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> They say Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> convinced <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> colleagues to allow the investigations, putting aside preoccupations with sovereignty and security to do what is needed to improve ties with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Everyone agrees it's extremely unlikely they will account for all the MIAs,'' one Western ambassador said. `` The joint investigation is an exercise in trying to find ways and means of normalizing relations. It's symbolism.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombers raided <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> from 1965 to 1968, then again in 1972. Pilots followed the glow of the lighthouse to strike <LOCATION> Haiphong </LOCATION>, the country's biggest port, Vietnamese officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the official press published information on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft losses in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> throughout the war and <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> kept records on deaths and burials of prisoners. Of the 2,393 MIA cases, 1,128 were classified from the beginning as `` killed in action-body not recovered,'' and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources say few of the remains will be found. The other 1,265 originally were labeled `` prisoner of war-missing in action,'' but a few years ago all but one symbolic case were changed to the status of presumed dead. In the villages, what evidence remains is fading with the memories of older residents and the destruction wrought by man and nature. Investigators said it was difficult to find people still living in crash areas because they fled during the bombing. Reports on crashes written by local officials often were inaccurate because of the chaos, said <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Can </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> MIA </ORGANIZATION> office. He said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has resolved 22 of the 70 discrepany cases, 11 by returning remains and the others by concluding after interviewing villagers that nothing could be recovered. In some cases aircraft exploded in the air, he said. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigator said: `` You go to a town in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and you ask what happened 20-25 years ago, after offices have been moved, records have been moved. It's hard. -LRB- The Vietnamese -RRB- have no equipment, no personnel, no money and they have great economic problems of their own.''

 More than 2,000 mourners who filled a school gym to remember five young girls killed by a speeding car heard condolences from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and a tape of a victim singing `` Could've Been.'' Many at Tuesday night's community service at <ORGANIZATION> Pulaski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> hugged and sobbed as the tape recording of rock star <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>'s song, sung by 12-year-old <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Watia </PERSON>, was played `` The flowers you gave me are just about to die. When I think of what could have been, it makes me want to cry,'' sang the girl's high-pitched voice This morning, 1,000 mourners filled filled a church for a funeral of three of the five girls who were killed Friday night. The Rev. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuczwara </PERSON> told the mourners, many of them young, that they could cry today and go back to their lives tomorrow or they could thank God for the gift of the girls' short lives and learn from them. `` Thirteen years young, but old enough to achieve something,'' said the pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Assumption </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blessed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. He said the girls needed no drugs or alcohol, but found happiness in their friends, family and faith. `` Remember, students, do n't cry for them. ... Cry for those who are looking for other ways to find happiness,'' <PERSON> Kuczwara </PERSON> said. Sobs rose as the caskets of <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON>, one month shy of her 13th birthday, and <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hylok </PERSON>, both 13, were closed in the church. Separate services were scheduled later today for <PERSON> Jodi </PERSON> <PERSON> Prokop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeefry </PERSON>, both 13. At Tuesday's gathering, <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON>'s version of the song was among the personal mementos the victims' families shared as this village of about 1,900 gathered for the first time since the accident. `` I feel they -LRB- the mourners -RRB- want something to happen but they do n't know what they want to happen,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuczwara </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Assumption </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blessed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Police have been puzzled as to why the driver of the 1975 <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION>, a 17-year-old high school junior, was going an estimated 70 mph down the residential street before it jumped a curb, killing the <ORGANIZATION> Glenbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> seventh-graders in front of <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>'s house Investigators planned to check the vehicle for possible mechanical problems and to investigate whether the driver, a diabetic, suffered a medical problem such as a seizure, said Police Chief Reed <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>. No alcohol was involved, he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a message sent with Rep. <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Wis., to the village about 15 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, said, `` <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I join with each and every one of you as you mourn the loss of five precious young lives `` There are no words to express what you are feeling or the grief that your fellow Americans share with you as a result of this great tragedy.'' Crying girls hugged one another at the high school, where dozens of floral arrangements surrounded the five closed caskets lined at one end of the gym. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Glenbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION>'s principal, estimated that more than 2,000 people filed past the caskets to hug the girls' families and offer sympathy Collages of photographs depicting each victim's life were placed on easels near each casket. Among the letters, cards and messages read during the service was a poem on friendship that <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcz </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, said was one of the last her sister had written. `` I need someone to stick to me to the end and I know that you will because you are my friend,'' the poem said. The Rev. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Grothman </PERSON>, minister at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>'s funeral was planned for today, applauded the community for the way it came together in the wake of the tragedy. `` I love <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> more. It's a community,'' he said. `` I do n't think I saw such a concentration of hugging that I saw Friday night <PERSON> Pulaski </PERSON> cares. Pulaski hugs.'' Residents also expressed concern for the driver of the car, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcz </PERSON>, who was listed in critical condition Monday at a <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> hospital. Hospital officials said Tuesday his parents had asked that no further reports be given on his condition. <PERSON> Karcz </PERSON> is a distant relative of <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcz </PERSON>. His 11-year-old sister, <PERSON> Tina </PERSON>, who was a passenger in the car, was also seriously injured. `` I'm sensing among the kids that they're feeling bad for the <PERSON> Karcz </PERSON> family,'' said <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, principal of the high school that <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcz </PERSON> attends.

<TEXT>
 A commission of journalists and academics, the third panel in 14 years to tackle the topic, called Wednesday for reviving the presidential press conference and making it a `` frequent, routine and undramatic'' institution. `` The longer presidents go without a press conference, the greater the suspicion that there is something to hide, and the greater the pressure becomes for holding press conferences,'' the panel said. `` When, ultimately, the president holds a conference, it is liable to be a hostile affair in which both the president and the press look bad. It would seem better, on balance, for the president to take his lumps on a more frequent basis.'' At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> said, the media must mend their ways if the press conference is to revive. The public wo n't lend its attention to the sessions if it believes reporters' questions are unfair, irrelevant or overly aggressive, it concluded. The 16-member commission studied the issue for a year. It was appointed by the <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shorenstein </PERSON> <PERSON> Barone </PERSON> <PERSON> Center </PERSON> on the Press, Politics and <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>. It was co-chaired by former newscaster <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalb </PERSON>, director of the center; and <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, assistant professor of public policy at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The commission said the presidential press conference, a 75-year-old institution, `` is not aging well'' and that under <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> it has fallen into `` a serious state of disrepair.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has held only 45 formal news conferences in his nearly eight years in office and once let 5 -LCB- months pass, during the Iran-Contra affair, without a formal meeting with reporters. President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> met with reporters nearly 1,000 times in 13 years in office. `` We believe that all parties would benefit from restoring the habit of frequent, routine and undramatic news conferences,'' the panel's report said. Properly conducted, news conferences can serve presidents, press and public alike, the commission said, and all suffer when the institution deteriorates. `` The press can often be irritating to presidents, appearing to assume an adversarial posture, question tactics and motives, distort the president's message or divulge uncomfortable information,'' the report added. `` When presidents get bad press _ and all do at one point or another during their presidency _ they are tempted to limit contact with reporters or to limit contact to situations more controllable than a press conference.'' The panel recommended that presidents meet with the media twice a month during daytime hours _ once with reporters who cover the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> routinely and once with smaller groups of journalists _ and hold six televised evening news conferences a year. Daytime news conferences should be held `` to reduce the temperature and encourage more substantive and useful exchanges,'' the panel suggested. It said this would give morning newspapers more time to prepare their stories and allow television evening news programs to show highlights of the session. The commission noted that it was the third to address the issue. In 1974, in the wake of Watergate, a group of scholars met at the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> and concluded the press conference was in a sad state. Six years later, after President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had avoided the press during the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hostage crisis, a panel at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> decried the `` distressing disrepair'' of the institution. Last month, presidential candidates <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, answering questions raised by the <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Managing Editors Association, promised to be accessible to the White House press if elected. Neither would say how often he would hold formal news sessions, however. In addition to <PERSON> Kalb </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, members of the commission are: <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> magazine correspondent; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Broder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reporter; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gergen </PERSON>, editor-at-large, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbers </PERSON>, contributing editor, Governing Magazine; <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, senior fellow, <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> bureau chief; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureau chief; <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> bureau </ORGANIZATION> chief; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Neustadt </PERSON>, professor of government, <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orren </PERSON>, associate professor, <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> correspondent; <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> correspondent; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>.

 Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> on Wednesday called on communist authorities to tear down the Berlin Wall and praised East Germans who have risked their lives to escape to the West. The State Department's No. 2 official, who spoke to reporters at the wall in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, recalled President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s June 1987 speech at the gray barrier <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> built in 1961 to stop the westward flow of refugees. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- called on those who put it up to tear it down _ and so they should. The sooner the better,'' said <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, who is in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on an official visit to East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` -LRB- The Berlin Wall -RRB- is a gray, monstrous snake,'' he said as he stood on a podium in front of what he called `` an anachronism, a barrier inconsistent with our contemporary world.'' He recalled recent escapes and escape attempts into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> from the eastern sector. `` When I hear of young men shot at as they run for freedom ... or of a pregnant woman chased by a patrol boat as she swims ... across the Spree -LRB- the river that divides East from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> -RRB-, I feel deep admiration for the courage of those Berliners,'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said that he had discussed with East German officials their country's practice of shooting at people trying to escape. `` I do believe that the shootings are less frequent than when I started to raise the issue,'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said the Allies governing <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ would continue to support <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1987 `` Berlin Initiative'' aimed at easing regulations and improving international air access to the divided city The Allied powers in December issued a memorandum to Soviet officials proposing improvements to the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Initiative. Allied officials have refused to disclose the Soviet response, but the West German newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> said last month that the Soviets accused the Allies of `` ignoring the territorial and political realities of central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>'s tour of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries included talks in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Tuesday with East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> also said `` a time of change'' was coming to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> because of people's dissatisfaction with economic and social conditions.

 A strong earthquake off the northern coast of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> shook houses in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> on Wednesday, although there were no reports of casualties or damage, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said. The temblor, recorded at 6:45 p.m. with its epicenter at sea about 60 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, registered 5.7 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion, the bureau said. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a `` major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a `` great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.

 although subsequent presidents have been tempted to put the press back out on the street, none has been willing to pay the price to do it,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday in a report urging more frequent meetings with the media. The commission gave this history of the presidential news conference: <PERSON> THEODORE </PERSON> <PERSON> ROOSEVELT </PERSON>: Although he took reporters in out of the rain, his sessions were not really news conferences: `` the reporters simply stood and listened while the president talked to them, often while being shaved by the White House barber.'' <PERSON> WOODROW </PERSON> <PERSON> WILSON </PERSON>: Really the father of the news conference. He believed presidents should be obliged to answer reporters' questions, just as <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prime ministers field questions from the opposition in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> met with the press once or twice a week in the first 2 -LCB- years of his term, then went a year without a session and held irregular meetings thereafer. <PERSON> WARREN </PERSON> <PERSON> HARDING </PERSON>: <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s successor met with the press twice a week for most of his presidency, but required that the questions be written and submitted in advance. <PERSON> CALVIN </PERSON> <PERSON> COOLIDGE </PERSON>: His sessions were cooler. If he did n't like a written question, he'd crumple it up and throw it away. <PERSON> HERBERT </PERSON> <PERSON> HOOVER </PERSON>: He met with reporters more than twice a week in his first few months in office, but after the 1929 stock market crash, he cut the frequency to once a week. These sessions were short and uninformative. <PERSON> FRANKLIN </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> ROOSEVELT </PERSON>: He met with reporters almost twice a week for 13 years. His press conferences were intimate affairs around his desk or, at Warm Springs, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, around his car. He often flattered reporters, impressed them with the depth of his knowledge, sometimes bullied them, once sent a reporter to sit in the corner wearing a dunce cap. He did n't insist on written questions, but sometimes put answers off the record and usually could only be paraphrased by reporters, not quoted directly. <PERSON> HARRY </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> TRUMAN </PERSON>: He moved the press conference from the Oval Office to the Indian Treaty Room in the Executive Office Building, creating a more formal atmosphere. Most of what he said was on the record, and sometimes his spunky, spontaneous answers got him in trouble. He averaged fewer than one a week. <PERSON> DWIGHT </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> EISENHOWER </PERSON>: He allowed television cameras in, changing forever the nature of news conferences, although live telecasts were not permitted. `` For the first time, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people could see their president as he interacted with the press,'' the report noted. `` And for the first time, reporters themselves became visible to the public as actors in the process.'' <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> cut the frequency, to once every two weeks. JOHN F. KENNEDY: His press conferences, marked by wit, `` became the standard against which subsequent presidents would be judged _ or judge themselves.'' He had a briefing book prepared and practiced answers. <PERSON> LYNDON </PERSON> <PERSON> JOHNSON </PERSON>: <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was a tough act to follow, and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, to avoid questions when his <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> policy came under challenge, took to making long opening statements. One study found his opening statements consumed more than one-third of the time. He averaged more than two press conferences a month. <PERSON> RICHARD </PERSON> <PERSON> NIXON </PERSON>: He averaged only six a year. During the Watergate crisis, when he went for five months without a news conference, the press became so hostile that he once stalked off without awaiting the usual closing, `` Thank you, Mr. President.'' <PERSON> GERALD </PERSON> FORD: He averaged one every three week, but still `` had difficulty dampening the press cynicism that had developed during the <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administrations,'' the report said. JIMMY CARTER: He kept to a two-a-month pledge for a year and a half, but ended up averaging half that many, holding fewer during the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hostage crisis. He moved them to the evening out of frustration with the way the television news shows edited his remarks at daytime news conferences. RONALD REAGAN: He pledged to hold news conferences once a month, but has held only 45 in more than 7 -LCB- years in office. Reporters have become `` so frustrated with limited access and their feeling of being manipulated that on occasion they have resorted to shouting questions at the president whenever they are allowed within earshot,'' the report said. `` The president, although successful in the short run in dodging difficult questions, suffers from the perception that he is not really in charge of his own White House.''

 Leading Islamic spokesman urged action Wednesday to counter what they said was widespread prejudice against Moslems as backward, ignorant fanatics. The concern over anti-Moslem sentiment became a principal theme as information ministers from more than 40 Islamic countries worked on a plan to improve the exchange of news among themselves and breaking down barriers to the non-Islamic world. Professor <PERSON> Abdelhadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Boutaleb </PERSON>, director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION>, Scientific and <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said the world's estimated 800 million Moslems must be educated against outside influences including `` foreign media'' characterizations of `` backwardness, ignorance and fanaticism as the main features of our peoples. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Sharifuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pir </PERSON> <PERSON> Zadeh </PERSON>, the Pakistani secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, told a closed session that reports from Western news agencies `` ignore or deliberately distort'' Islamic issues. Some Saudi newspapers echoed the theme. The Jiddah-based English-language Arab News urged the information ministers to act against an `` ugly phenomenon'' that it said was particularly virulent in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but also apparent in nationalist movements within the communist bloc and increasing even in the Third World. `` Outside the Islamic world, anti-Islamic prejudice is most definitely on the increase. Much of it is pure religious bigotry, but there is a marked streak of racism involved in it as well,'' the newspaper said. It said any effort to correct this would be wasted if it is `` nothing more than a machine pushing Islamic information back into the Islamic world. `` We can not allow ourselves to rely on the insensitive and uncomprehending international news agencies ... when <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> is involved,'' it said. Except for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television crew from <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, Western news agencies appeared to be the only outside media permitted to cover the conference. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> rarely grants entry to foreign reporters. The two-day meeting in this <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port city drew ministers or their representatives from all but a few of the 46 members of the conference. The absentees included <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, whose Marxist government was expelled from the conference several years ago, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, with which host <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> broke diplomatic relations in April.

 The capital's 17,000 cabbies on Wednesday extended a 15-day boycott of downtown <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to the end of the month to protest anti-pollution measures restricting taxis in the city center. Taxis are included in traffic restrictions banning half the city's 800,000 cars from a 5-square-mile zone around the city center from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays, based on odd and even license plate numbers. `` We decided to extend the boycott until Oct. 31 because we felt the government was n't taking us seriously enough,'' said a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Athens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drivers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. Cabbies object to the taxi ban, in effect since January, saying half of their fares are generated in the city center. The union says the average driver takes home about $ 400 a month. A brown colored smog, known to Athenians as the `` Nefos'' _ the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> word for cloud _ forms over the city on warm, still days. Cars, diesel-powered taxis and the city's aging buses are blamed for most of the pollution. The transport ministry has threatened taxi drivers boycotting the downtown area with a $ 200 fine and removal of their operating license.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today pledged $ 600 million to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign for the reconstruction of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and repatriation of millions of Afghan refugees, the program's coordinator said. The coordinator, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadruddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, told reporters the Soviet pledge was the largest to date since an appeal for donations went out in June.

Moslem guerrillas have been at war for nearly 10 years with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s pro-Soviet government. Soviet troops entered the country in December 1979 but began withdrawing in May under terms of a U.N.-mediated accord signed in April. Under the agreement, the more than 100,000 Soviet troops are to be out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Aug. 15. <PERSON> Sadruddin </PERSON> said he has also received pledges of $ 60 million from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which said it planned further contributions and would send civilian personnel to aid in refugee repatriation; $ 27 million from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>; $ 7 million from <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>; and 10,000 tons of food aid from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> worth $ 2 million. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was unable to estimate how much it would contribute due to the upcoming presidental election and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> being in recess, <PERSON> Sadruddin </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> today overturned a decision that had threatened to throw the state's `` official English'' initiative off the Nov. 8 ballot on the grounds that the petitions for the proposal should have been available in Spanish The appellate court panel issued the decision at the end of a 90-minute hearing this morning on <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>'s appeal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrigan </PERSON>'s decision of Sept. 16 <PERSON> Carrigan </PERSON> had said petitions circulated in 12 <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> counties should have been printed in Spanish and English. The petitions were printed in English only. He said failure to circulate bilingual petitions in those counties violated the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965. The decision had thrown the status of the `` official English'' ballot initiative into doubt, because his rejection of petitions from the 12 counties dropped the number of valid signatures on the petitions to just 36,874. A total of 50,686 signatures were needed to get the measure on the ballot. But <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> had placed the proposed amendment on the general election ballot despite <PERSON> Carrigan </PERSON>'s ruling, hoping that her appeal would be accepted by the 10th <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. After the court ruled today, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said, `` This one will be voted on. We're through as of today.'' <PERSON> Carrigan </PERSON> had based his ruling on a portion of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Voting Rights Act that requires election literature to be distributed in a second language in areas where more than 5 percent of the population has a limited knowledge of English. His ruling had been watched closely in other states besides <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, because of concern that it could affect not only other initiatives on this year's ballot, but laws passed by previous initiatives. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, opponents of an official English amendment in that state went to federal court to get the measure removed from the November ballot, citing <PERSON> Carrigan </PERSON>'s ruling on bilingual petitions. Proposed Amendment 1 says simply: `` An amendment to the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Constitution to declare that the English language is the official language of the state of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>.'' Critics have called the proposal racist, while proponents say that English is a bond that helps hold <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s `` melting pot'' together. In announcing its decision today, the appeals court said a written ruling giving details on the reasons for overturning <PERSON> Carrigan </PERSON>'s decision would be issued later.

<HEAD>Government Pledges Crime Crackdown but Opposes Death Penalty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRIGHTON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government Wednesday promised a crackdown on rising crimes of violence, but refused to restore the death penalty. Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> told his ruling <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s annual convention he would recruit more police, build more prison space, impose further curbs on drunkenness and introduce electronic tags to keep track of alleged offenders But his rejection of the death penalty clearly bucked sentiment at the convention. With <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> looking on, delegate <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanbrook </PERSON> ended his pro-death penalty speech by unexpectedly asking pro-hanging delegates to raise their hands. A majority did. Hanging was abolished in 1969, and attempts to restore it have been repeatedly defeated ever since. `` Do n't let's get stuck just in this groove,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> urged the delegates. `` Capital punishment ca n't be the answer to all crime, or even to violent crime in general.'' The second day of the convention also dealt with the environment and energy, and included a pledge by Energy Minister <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> to sell the state-owned coal industry to private ownership after the next election, which must be held by 1992. But the day's dominant issue was law and order, which is increasingly preoccupying <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION> as police reported a 12 percent increase in violent crime in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> last year and an 11 percent increase in sexual offenses. Electronic tagging would enable authorities to free suspects instead of locking them in prisons, which already are rated the most overcrowded in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The Home Office said the tagging trials would take place in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> only, and the specific test areas had not been selected. `` The apparatus is relatively simple,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> explained. `` It looks ike an electronic bicycle clip, and it works ... If this project proves successful then we shall take the idea further.'' He said it could be used for offenders who would otherwise be remanded in custody, and to enable judges to hand down more community service sentences. `` There should be restrictions on the young thief's leisure time,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. `` It would do him good to be made to stay at home during pub opening hours, or on Saturday afternoon while the football is going on. Electronic monitoring fits in here.'' The tag, attached to the ankle, transmits a signal to a police receiver. If the suspect violates his curfew hours, the signal is broken and he can be rearrested. The <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> attacked the scheme as `` unnecessary, expensive, ineffective and uncivilized,'' while the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Probation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tagging programs had not reduced the prison population. The Tories insist crime is up because school and parental discipline has declined, while the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> blames it on Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s free-market doctrines, which it says foster greedy individualism.

 A training exercise for a fire crew at an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base turned into a life-and-death struggle when a tanker plane crashed, killing all six crew members and injuring 10 passengers. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said today it had n't determined the cause of the crash Tuesday afternoon at <ORGANIZATION> Wurtsmith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. A board of officers will be appointed to investigate the crash. <LOCATION> Wurtsmith </LOCATION>, located near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION>, is one of two <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> bases in the Strategic Air Command. Nineteen B-52 bombers aryek with nuclear-tipped cruise missiles and nuclear bombs are based at <LOCATION> Wurtsmith </LOCATION>. The KC-135 Stratotanker, a four-engine plane used to refuel other planes, was returning to the base from a mission to K.I. <ORGANIZATION> Sawyer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> when it crashed and burned, said Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawber </PERSON>, a spokesman at <LOCATION> Wurtsmith </LOCATION> in the northeastern <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. The six crew members died at the scene, authorities said. Eight of the 10 injured were treated and released from the <ORGANIZATION> 379th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> at the base, Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said. Two people admitted to the base hospital were in good condition today. The base's firefighters had just completed a training exercise when the accident occurred, and they quickly doused the flames, said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Babble </PERSON>. The aircraft was making its landing approach when it crashed into the tarmac, said Airman <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON>, another base spokesman. The plane's pilot had not radioed a distress call before the crash, she said. A witness, who was not identified, told The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> one of the plane's wings touched the ground as it was landing before it veered out of control. The plane slammed into the ground, skidded more than a quarter mile and came to rest in a grassy area about 150 yards off the runway. <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON> said investigators have ruled out wind shear as the cause of the crash, which occurred in sunny weather with light winds. Pinpointing the cause will be difficult, she said, because the plane was not equipped with a flight recorder like the `` black box'' carried by commercial airliners. `` Not much of an airplane was left,'' said state police Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pegg </PERSON> at the East Tawas post. `` Basically, all that was left was a tail section.'' The 10 passengers, all military personnel, were being brought to Wurtsmith from K.I. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> to participate in a base inspection, part of preparation for an inspection by officials from <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, spokeswoman for K.I. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>. The dead crewmen were identified as Capt. <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giles </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Bunker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the pilot; Capt <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, the co-pilot; 2nd Lt. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Szuter </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Kirtland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, a navigator; Airman 1st Class <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parham </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, a boom operator; Capt. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Montague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, an instructor-navigator; and Capt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, an instructor and radar navigator. All were based at <LOCATION> Wurtsmith </LOCATION>. According to an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> fact sheet, the KC-135 is a military version of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 transport and can fly at near-sonic speed and altitudes up to 50,000 feet.

<HEAD>Nobel Literature Announcement Thursday</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 18 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> made their final deliberations for Thursday's 1988 Nobel literature prize announcement under pressure to fill some gaps in the award's 87-year history No writer from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has ever won the prestigous prize, despite that country's 3,000-year literary tradition. The laureate list, which dates back to 1901, contains just two Asians. Only six women have ever been honored. In keeping with tradition, the academy's secretary, <PERSON> Sture </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, announces the winner when a gold clock in the academy's 18th century office strikes 1 p.m. -LRB- 8 a.m. EDT -RRB-. The other Nobel prizes are to be announced next week by the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Karolinska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. They include the awards for chemistry, physics, economics and medicine. The peace prize, announced in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, on Sept. 29, went to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces around the world. This year's prizes are worth $ 390,000 each. The last woman to win the literature prize was <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Nelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, who shared it with a man, S.J. Agnon of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, in 1966. Despite <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s ingrained system of sexual equality, men outnumber women on the academy by 16-2. All members serve for life. The last Asian winner was <PERSON> Yasunari </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawabata </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1968. From there, the gap stretches back to 1913 and Indian laureate <PERSON> Rabindranath </PERSON> <PERSON> Tagore </PERSON>. `` I would say it is time for a Chinese author,'' said <PERSON> Asa </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON>, an editor at <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s leading literary magazines. She suggested <PERSON> Bad </PERSON> <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> or female novelist <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rong </PERSON>. Academy members keep a strict code of secrecy. They never discuss candidates by name. However, member <PERSON> Goran </PERSON> <PERSON> Malmqvist </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> hinted in an interview that this year's choice should satisfy most people. `` I find it hard to imagine any nasty comments,'' he said. `` This year we have a short list with extraordinarily worthy candidates,'' said <PERSON> Malmqvist </PERSON>. `` They all have contributed to world literature.'' The academy has been studying the list of less than 10 candidates since before the summer, he said. Culture page editors of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s biggest newspapers and publishing houses admitted they were at loss for a good guess this year. But speculation centered on a handful of favorites, including <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordimer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and Mexican writers <PERSON> Octavio </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> or <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>. Others mentioned by perennial Nobel watchers included <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> author <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Oates </PERSON>, Trinidad-born Indian writer V.S. <PERSON> Naipaul </PERSON>, Japanese authors <PERSON> Yasushi </PERSON> <PERSON> Inove </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kobo </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Moravia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kross </PERSON>, an Estonian who spent eight years in a Soviet labor camp in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. Then there is <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>. The British writer has been discussed since the 1960s and has become known as `` the man who did not get the Nobel prize.'' According to many accounts, <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> has been blocked by academy member <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundqvist </PERSON>, who objects that his novels do not raise literary standards. However, <PERSON> Lundqvist </PERSON>'s influence in the academy is said to have declined since he suffered a serious illness in 1981. The Swedish national news agency <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> suggested East German author <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Marguerite </PERSON> <PERSON> Duras </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lessing </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Matute </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> among the possible female winners. `` Will -LRB- <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> -RRB- once again have to hear the eternal question: Why do n't you ever choose a woman?'' <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> said. The election of <PERSON> Malmqvist </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> specialist, to the academy in 1985 reflected an awareness of criticism for having a decidedly pro-European or Western slant. The following year the prize went for the first time to an African, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Wole </PERSON> <PERSON> Soyinka </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobel </PERSON>, who made his fortune from inventing dynamite and other explosives, stipulated in his will that the prize be awarded to the author who produced `` the most outstanding work of an ideal tendency.'' Nobel died in 1896. His words have been interpreted differently by the generations of academies. In the first decades after World War II the prize was awarded to modernists, such as the poet T.S. <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON>, and to established writers such as <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Russel </PERSON>. In the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, the prize was used to draw attention to masters who wrote for a limited audience and were unknown worldwide, such as Czech poet <PERSON> Jaroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Seifert </PERSON> in 1984 and Greek writer <PERSON> Odysseus </PERSON> <PERSON> Elytis </PERSON>, the 1981 laureate. The laureates will be given their awards in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> Dec. 10. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> is to accept the peace prize in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> on the same day, the anniversary of Nobel's death

 Two men charged with the 1983 murder of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> producer who was trying to finance `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'' movie have pleaded innocent, denying allegations that could bring the death penalty. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Molony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamota </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> are accused of gunning down producer <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>, who authorities say was targeted for death in connection with his unsuccessful attempt to finance the film. <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> pleaded innocent Tuesday to murder and special circumstance allegations of committing murder for financial gain and lying in wait for the victim. They could face the death penalty if convicted. Municipal Court Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> set a Nov. 7 hearing for motions preceding a preliminary hearing.

Mrs. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON>, a key figure in the <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> allegations, is fighting extradition from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Another defendant, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, is awaiting extradition proceedings in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Deremer </PERSON>, charged only in the Mincher killing, was returned here from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> on Tuesday after waiving extradition. Prosecutors allege that Mrs. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON>, formerly known as <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, ordered <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>'s execution after a dispute over her financial cut of the movie, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON>, who authorities said was involved in cocaine dealing, allegedly introduced <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> to movie producer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who was then seeking financing for the film about the legendary <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> night spot. <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>, 33, who had produced vaudeville shows in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, saw `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'' as his chance to enter the Hollywood big time, prosecutors said. He was embroiled in a deal to raise $ 35 million for the film from Puerto Rican investors when he disappeared May 13, 1983. <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> failed to show up that night for a dinner at a swank <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> restaurant. A month later, his bullet-riddled body was found dumped in a rural area 60 miles from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Dukakis Needs to Get the Debate Onto His Issues _ and With a Smile</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Closer but still trailing after the campaign's first two debates, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> faces <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Thursday in what may be the Democrats' last chance to move the presidential race onto their issues And, importantly, to do it with a smile. In the final debate before the election, each candidate would love to land a knockout blow, to be so eloquent and impressive or to so damage his rival that the race for the presidency would be greatly altered. That's not likely, however. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with an apparent lead in the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> that exceeds his narrowing margin in national polls, needs this debate less than the Democratic nominee and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. The vice president has no doubt been spending some time preparing a retort for any jibes <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> might make about his selection of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as running mate. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in the first presidential debate, will do `` very well when we get into the debates'' _ something polls agree <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did not do in the vice-presidential face-off last week. For <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as the underdog and as the challenger who represents change, 90 minutes on a stage with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> before a national television audience poses a last opportunity. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> forces see the debate as his chance to confront <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the negative charges the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign has been heaping on him. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tried that in the first debate when he accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of questioning his patriotism and declared, `` I resent it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> since has moved on, pummeling <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> anew over the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison furlough program. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> showed anger last weekend at the suggestion he was insensitive to victims of crime, and his aides said they hope to keep the nominee angry. `` Stop this shameless playing of politics with the tragedy of crime,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a line he's likely to replay to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Answering the other guy's charges is n't usually enough, though. Many Democrats say <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> still needs to make the case for himself on the issues of his choosing _ principally the economy. And he needs to show some warmth, passion, and even humor in the process. Polls after their first debate indicated many people credited <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with his grasp of the issues. But they also suggested many did n't find much they liked in the often-dour <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In his first debate, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s main fault may have been his passionless answer to the question about his lack of passion. `` I care deeply about people,'' he said, in a phrase he repeated. `` I may be a little calmer than some about it.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been frustrated so far in making his economic themes connect with voters. He is trying to make a point that prosperity is n't reaching many Americans, and that the economic future is clouded. His thematic phrase has been changing almost weekly in an effort to find one that resonates: `` Bringing prosperity home,'' `` Middle class squeeze,'' and now, `` Make America No. 1.'' Advisers want <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to paint <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the candidate of the wealthy and privileged, of Wall Street and big business. Some of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' best moments on the stump have come when he tried that. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plays <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> to the wealthy and <PERSON> Ebenezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Scrooge </PERSON> to the rest of us,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said recently, holding a $ 20 bill aloft in ridicule of the savings provided to middle-class Americans by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tax-deferred savings account plan. Look for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to repeat that one, too. `` They've got to draw a clear line of which candidate is on your side,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, a Democratic consultant who has advised <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the debates. `` They've failed in doing that so far, mainly because they've been on the defensive.''

<HEAD>Effort to Abolish S&amp;L Assets Disposition Agency Falls Short</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> refused Wednesday to abolish the much-criticized federal agency created to manage and sell off the worst assets of insolvent savings institutions. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 247-130 to approve the measure. Under the procedure used, however, two-thirds of those voting had to be in favor of the legislation for passage, and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> failed to reach that margin by five votes. Even if the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had approved the bill, there was little chance for passage by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which has n't considered such legislation. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, a quasi-public organization, was formed by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 to assist the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in the management and disposition of acquired assets. Lawmakers have accused it of favoritism, conflicts of interest and mismanagement of the $ 3.9 billion in loans and real estate in its care. <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> was criticized bitterly for paying salaries as high as $ 250,000 annually, cloaking its activities in secret and failing to dispose of many of the assets placed in its custody. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved the bill on Oct. 4 by a vote of 42-8, with all the negative votes coming from Republicans who see the legislation as a political measure rather than substantive action. The legislation would have given the bank board 60 days to close <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> and limit severence pay for employees to about $ 4,700, or three weeks' salary, rather than the four months' pay pledged by the agency early this year. The bill, similar to a section of the omnibus banking legislation approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in August, would have assigned <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION>'s activities to <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, the government insurance fund that backs S & amp; L deposits up to $ 100,000. Reps. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanjorski </PERSON>, D-Pa., and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillen </PERSON>, D-Md., introduced the Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman and floor manager for the bill, said in debate that his panel had been investigating <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> for the past 15 months. `` Our findings clearly establish that this agency has become a wasteful bureaucracy, lacing in accountability, and providing an inefficient means of disposing of property acquired from failed savings and loan associations,'' he said. `` High salaries, big expense accounts and CIA-like secrecy have become the agency's claims to fame during its three-year existence.''

<HEAD>Governor Gives Optimistic Picture of Hong Kong</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> on Wednesday delivered an optimistic review on conditions in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, but said problems exist and they must be solved to retain the prosperity and dynamism of this British colony. In an annual address opening a new session of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s chief lawmaking body, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said he was confident about the colony's economic growth despite public concern over its return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1997 when a territorial lease expires. He said <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s Gross Domestic Product was expected to grow by 6 percent this year, or half the 1987 figure, but explained this was the result of economic consolidation following earlier years of double digit growth. `` <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> has prospered over the past decades by maintaining an open economy,'' he said. `` Nevertheless, we have to recognize that we are dependent not just on ourselves but on the economic performance of our major overseas markets and on our continued access to them.'' As an example of concern, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> singled out an unsuccessful attempt by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month to override President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto on legislation to tighten curbs on textile imports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We must continue to be aware of, and guard against, protectionist sentiment in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> exported roughly $ 4.3 billion worth of apparel and textile goods to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year. It was the single largest category in exports that totaled $ 9.2 billion. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Sino-Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> relations are developing well. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> still faces a problem over the resettlement of Vietnamese boat people, who continue to arrive despite a government policy to repatriate to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> those regarded as economic migrants and not genuine refugees. He said 133,00 boat people have arrived in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> since the fall of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to the communists in 1975. There are roughly 25,000 still in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said their rate of resettlement to other countries has dropped sharply in recent years. `` The tragedy is that doors are no longer open for them,'' he said. `` They are people on a journey to nowhere.''

<HEAD>NAACP Lawyers Urge Court Not To Retreat On Civil Rights Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was urged Wednesday to uphold a key 1976 civil rights decision and not retreat in the fight to eliminate `` the badges of slavery'' in American society. <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> LeVonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> said the court's 12-year-old ruling conforms with a law <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed in 1866 to eradicate racial discrimination in the wake of emancipation. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had egregious conduct to correct'' after the Civil War, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said. And, he continued, `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> meant to reach the type of conduct'' at issue in Wednesday's case. <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, who is black, said, `` We're not working on the farms now. We're working in credit unions. But the badges of slavery were what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was trying to reach.'' The Civil Rights Act of 1866 was intended to ensure recently freed slaves all the rights of citizenship. Chambers is representing a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> woman who accused her former employer, <ORGANIZATION> McLean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, of racial harassment. The case has attracted as much attention as any in the court's new term begun last week. Civil rights advocates say they are concerned it might signal a willingness by a newly solidified conservative court majority to wipe out gains made by minorities over the last 30 years. The justices are deciding whether they mistakenly ruled in 1976 that the 1866 law authorizes suits against private citizens accused of discrimination. The court is expected to announce its decision next year. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer representing <ORGANIZATION> McLean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the 1866 law `` would not reach private acts of discrimination'' and the court in 1976 interfered with the will of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in extending the reach of the old statute. <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> received sharp questioning from the justices when he said the proper course now for the court was to abandon precedent and reverse its 12-year-old ruling. Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> must come up with something more than the argument that the 1976 ruling interfered with congressional prerogatives. `` If that's all you have, I'm afraid it's nothing,'' <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> said. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the court's newest member and potentially a decisive swing vote in the case, asked Chambers where the court should draw the line in applying the 1866 law. Could it be invoked, he asked, to sue an employer for using a racial epithet? `` Where's the controlling principle,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> asked? <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said the law would apply if the use of the epithet demonstrated an intent to discriminate and was not an isolated occurence. The court sent shock waves through the civil rights community last April when it announced it would use the credit union case to consider reversing the 1976 decision, called <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> McCrary </PERSON>. While no party to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> case urged the court to reconsider the 1976 precedent, the justices by a 5-4 vote took the extraordinary step of acting on their own initiative to call for a reexamination. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> were in the majority, along with Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. The dissenters said the move threatened to undermine the faith minorities have placed in the high court. In <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> McCrary </PERSON>, the court held that racially segregated private schools which refuse to admit blacks violate the 1866 law. The ruling allows civil rights groups to use the 1866 law as a weapon to attack private discrimination in all forms. For example, no other federal law bars racially segregated private schools. Also, the law provides for heavy punitive damages against those found to have practiced discrimination. That is of particular importance in job bias cases which account for some three-fourths of the suits filed under the 1866 law. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1964 outlawed on-the-job discrimination, but did not provide for such heavy penalties. The 1866 law also is a key recourse for those challenging bias in the sale of private homes. The attorneys general of nearly every state, a majority of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators, more than 100 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members and more than 100 civil rights and public interest groups are urging the court not to tamper with the 1976 ruling. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has not taken an official position in the dispute. The case stems from an appeal by <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, a black woman who was a teller at <ORGANIZATION> McLean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. She sued under the 1866 law, seeking actual and punitive damages for alleged harassment. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 upheld a ruling by a federal judge in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, throwing out her suit.

<HEAD>Network Seeks to Mobilize Fight Against Greenhouse Effect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An international conference concluded Wednesday that the warming of the Earth from the `` greenhouse effect'' is a crisis requiring massive scientific and political coordination to stem the burning of fossil fuels and halve the emissions of carbon dioxide by the year 2030. The effort must entail fundamental changes in lifestyle, including a rapid switch to solar, wind and other `` environmentally sound'' energy sources, new farming techniques and the abandonment of some chemical products, the conference said. It also recommended that the industrial nations forgive certain debts of the Third World, as an incentive for poorer nations to conserve and replenish their tropical forests. Representatives from 35 nations attended the three-day, <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greenhouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> to formulate recommendations for heading off what many scientists have warned could be a disastrous overheating of the Earth. `` This crisis is of such overwhelming magnitude that it will require a truly global response,'' said <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trends </ORGANIZATION>, which sponsored the meeting. The greenhouse effect is a warming of the Earth caused by the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere. The gases, largely a result of burning fossil fuels like coal and oil, allow radiation from the sun to warm the planet, but block excess heat from radiating back into space. The effect is similar to that of a greenhouse for growing plants. `` Global warming is already occurring ... and the planet faces the possibility of profound disruption in the coming decades,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a climatologist from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anglia </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Scientists have warned that the consequences of even a slight global warming could include increased droughts and other severe effects upon crop production. Moreover, they say it could melt the ice caps, threatening coastal areas with higher seas, and even produce stronger hurricanes in future years. Among the other recommendations of the conference: _ Taxes on use of carbon-based fuels and other penalties for damaging the environment, targeted at industrialized nations The money raised from these penalties would go to an international fund to assist nations seeking ways to cope with climate change. _ Rejection of nuclear, genetic-engineering and other high-technology responses to the climate problem _ Tax incentives and legislation to discourage use of chlorofluorocarbons, a type of chemical used in refrigerators and other industrial processes which can damage the environment _ Reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide by one-fifth by the year 2000, and by half by 2030 _ Tax incentives and legislation to encourage energy efficiency and conservation in industrial, residential and commercial uses _ A switch by agriculture away from petrochemical fertilizers to organic products `` It is recognized that these goals can not be achieved without fundamental changes in lifestyle and consumption patterns in the industrialized world and structural changes in socio-economic relationships worldwide, `` the conference concluded. The group also announced plans for a celebration of Global Earth Day in 1990, and designation of the 1990s as the Environmental Decade.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s military leader on Wednesday announced a new campaign aimed at weeding out corrupt officials in top government circles and commercial banks. Gen. <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Babangida </PERSON>, who seized power from another military leader in 1985, would not detail what form the campaign would take. In his comments to the country's attorney generals, <PERSON> Babangida </PERSON> said corrupt officials would be punished and that the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> was working on new decrees and regulations for the campaign. The president said he particularly was concerned about personal enrichment by government officials and bankers. He said if it was not curbed now, corruption could be permanently entrenched by the time his military government handed power over to a civilian government in 1992.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials hope that a disassembled spacecraft sitting in crates at a hangar Wednesday will be en route to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> by April as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first interplanetary explorer in 11 years. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> showed off the scattered pieces of the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft to reporters and photographers four days after the spacecraft's arrival by truck from the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> plant in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. If all goes well, the parts will be assembled and checked out over the next few months and then transported to the launch pad in March to be loaded aboard the space shuttle Atlantis, said <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s director of payloads projects management. The scheduled launch date is April 28. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> will have only 25 days, until May 23, to get Atlantis off the pad before <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> moves out of its favorable alignment with <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Otherwise the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> voyage will have to be delayed about two years, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> program manager for <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON>, which built the probe for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Once the shuttle is in orbit, the crew will release <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> from the cargo bay and a rocket will start it on the 466-day trip to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. It will be the first planetary probe launched from a shuttle as well as the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planetary mission since two Pioneer spacecraft were dispatched in 1978 to study <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>' atmosphere. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> is to settle into an elliptical orbit around <LOCATION> Venus </LOCATION> ranging from 155 miles to 1,180 miles above the surface. Each circuit of the planet will take 3.1 days, and during the 40 minutes the craft is nearest the surface, an advanced radar will peer through the constant cloud layer and obtain images of the surface, which will be relayed to an Earth station. During each orbit, the radar, supplied by <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, will map a swath of surface 15 miles wide and 10,000 miles long. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said it would take 1,853 such swaths, recorded over 243 days, to chart the entire planet. `` The spacecraft will be conducting basic research about how <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> was formed,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told a news conference. `` To find out, we need to know the topography of the planet. `` We now have the topography of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, the moon, Mars and Mercury, but we do n't have the topography of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> because of the cloud cover,'' he said. `` The imaging radar will give us that topography.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> will enable scientists for the first time to study detailed images of Venus like those formed by wind or flowing liquid, craters and large landslides. While <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s closest neighbor in the solar system, the two planets are vastly different. <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> has a surface temperature of about 900 degrees Fahrenheit, its atmopshere is almost entirely carbon dioxide, and its atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of Earth. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said one goal of the mission is to try to learn why the two planets evolved so differently.

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> are joining forces against bandit gangs from both countries whose looting and robbing rampages in recent months have resulted in hundreds of deaths in western <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. Among targeted warlords is Acheikh <PERSON> Ibn </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON>, once designated by <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> as <PERSON> Chad </PERSON>'s president, whose army of 2,000 renegades is said to be hiding out in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. A Chadian-Sudanese committee went this week to <LOCATION> Fasher </LOCATION>, capital of the west's main region <LOCATION> Darfur </LOCATION>, to meet with <PERSON> Ibn </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> and leaders of other armed Chadian factions. The Chadian delegation has been in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> since Saturday, discussing ways to improve security near the frontier to stop infiltration of armed bands. Border insecurity has bedeviled Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s civilian government almost ever since it took power in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> in 1986 from a junta that had ruled for a year after a coup Brigadier <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Haren </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Darfur </LOCATION>'s chief of police, said more than 3,000 civilians and at least 100 policemen have been killed by armed robbers in the region since 1984. Early this year, he said, six or seven armed robberies were occurring every day. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> and others have complained bitterly of the spillover of the war between <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>. They have charged that soldiers from both countries have sought in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> a haven from the fighting, with easy pickings for robbery, or have used Sudanese territory as a short cut between <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and the battle fronts in <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>. Despite his outwardly friendly relations with <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, the prime minister ordered Libyan troops out of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> in 1985 and again the next year. Some of the 2,000 originally in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> are thought still to remain. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> declared the prolonged war ended in May and resumed diplomatic relations this month with the government of <PERSON> Hissene </PERSON> <PERSON> Habre </PERSON>, formerly his bitter enemy. Sudanese officials have announced several times that the members of <PERSON> Ibn </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON>'s troops had surrendered their weapons to the army. Last week, however, Cabinet Affairs Minister <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Salam </PERSON> admitted that only 955 men had turned in their weapons and said the government does n't know the whereabouts of the rest of the 2,000 men. But <PERSON> Tigani </PERSON> <PERSON> Sysi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Darfur </LOCATION>'s governor, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> they have entered the <PERSON> Jabal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mara </PERSON> mountains near <LOCATION> Fasher </LOCATION>, where they are looting and robbing Sudanese villages and travelers. He said there are 32 different bandit gangs in western <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. The cooperative Sudanese-Chadian effort follows a series of fruitless tries by the Sudanese alone. Last month, the cabinet committee decided to close <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s frontiers with both <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, but such a task is almost impossible considering that the 1,000-mile border is almost all desert

 Cuban officials escorted a seized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchant ship carrying <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup racing yacht into international waters today, where the vessel apparently resumed its trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horse </LOCATION> departed from the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> port at 11:40 a.m. <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> time -LRB- 12:40 p.m. EDT -RRB- and the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> pilots left 20 minutes later. `` They said they were seized, the vessel was inspected and their passports were checked,'' <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON> said after the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> talked to the ship by radio. `` The Cubans claimed their vessel was nine miles offshore,'' <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON> said, quoting the crew. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> claims a 12-mile territorial limit. `` The information we have right now is that they are still going to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We have not been asked to meet them.'' Earlier today, a press aide to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> said his office had been told by the Cuban diplomatic mission in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the eight Americans and one New Zealander aboard were `` safe and well.'' The spokesman for the Cuban mission was not available to answer questions about the incident, which began Tuesday afternoon when the Cubans seized the ship after it allegedly entered Cuban territorial waters. The ship was detained Tuesday in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cayo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogeley </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The dissembled sloop <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> was aboard the 160-foot U.S.-registered merchant ship, officials said. The 133-foot yacht was en route from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for a tour of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> cities. The Cubans seized the vessel off the southeastern tip of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> without firing shots or using force, saying it had violated the communist country's 12-mile territorial limit, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. Capt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Jappe </PERSON> radioed an urgent appeal Tuesday at 3 p.m. EDT to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, insisting he was in international waters, but <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officers advised him to comply with the Cubans, <PERSON> Vogeley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION>'s agent, <ORGANIZATION> Zapata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION>, said he did n't know why the ship was seized but also maintained it was in international waters. `` We're at as much of a loss as anyone else,'' <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> said. San Diego-based Sail <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> managed the successful <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense of the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup race by sailing the catamaran <ORGANIZATION> Stars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Stripes against the single-hulled <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> last month off <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fay </PERSON>, chairman of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> Challenge, forced the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> into an early defense of the cup this year after winning a court order that validated his challenge of race rules. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> was twice as long as the traditional 12-meter yachts used in cup competitions. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> club responded by building a dual-hulled catamaran to defend the Cup, and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> skippered the <ORGANIZATION> Stars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Stripes to two easy victories to sweep a best-of-three series. <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> estimated the <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION>'s value at $ 3 million, but said he did n't know what the sailing vessel was worth.

<TEXT>
 The next president could very well be forced to preside over a sharp decline in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> living standards unless he acts quickly to deal with pressing international economic problems, two staff members of the private Council on Foreign Relations said Wednesday. The president's ability to deal with economic problems has been fundamentally altered by the fact that financial markets have coalesced into a single worldwide market, the specialists wrote in a new book, `` After <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>: Confronting the Changed World Economy.'' `` The next president will face more difficult constraints and more difficult choices than any of his predecessors over the last 40 years,'' <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Aho </PERSON>, one of the authors, told reporters at a briefing. `` A president must face the voters only once every four years, but he must face the judgment of the markets every business day,'' said <PERSON> Aho </PERSON>, who is director of economic studies for the council. `` If he does n't have a credible economic policy, markets could react, sending the dollar plunging and interest rates soaring.'' <PERSON> Aho </PERSON> and his co-author, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>, pointed to the worldwide collapse of stock markets last Oct. 19 as a warning of what can happen if investors lose confidence in the ability of governments to manage their international affairs. Because of the huge trade deficits of the 1980s, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has transferred billions of dollars into the hands of foreigners to pay for imported televisions and cars. That situation has transformed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from the world's largest creditor nation to the largest debtor country, meaning that foreigners now own more in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets than Americans own in foreign assets. <PERSON> Aho </PERSON> and <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> predicted that this imbalance between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and foreign ownership of assets will hit $ 1 trillion in the early 1990s. The country's net foreign obligations stood at $ 368.2 billion at the end of 1987. A net debt poses the risk of lowering the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standard of living because Americans will have to transfer between $ 40 billion and $ 50 billion annually overseas in debt service to foreigners, money that will not be available in this country, the authors said. <LOCATION> Oho </LOCATION> said the flow of foreign capital into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has helped to finance a consumption binge as Americans and the government spent more than they were earning. `` We are going to have to slow down our excess consumption and start servicing our debt,'' he said. The authors made the following policy recommendations for the next president: _ The federal budget deficit, which totaled an estimated $ 150 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, should be cut over the next four years through a combination of tax increases and cuts in defense spending and benefit programs such as Social Security and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> _ Growing pressures to erect protectionist trade barriers should be resisted But they said American trade negotiators need to be tougher in getting other nations to open their markets to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods so that this country will be able to run a surplus in merchandise trade to help service the deficit it will have in investment earnings. _ The policies of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> need a major overhaul in the area of Third World debt The two organizations should be focusing their efforts on ways to reduce the $ 1.2 trillion debt of developing nations rather than pursuing endless strategies of rescheduling the debt payments. _ The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should abandon its effort with other major countries to prop up the value of the dollar and instead allow market forces to drive it lower The authors said without a further dollar devaluation, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trade deficit will not be eliminated. <PERSON> Aho </PERSON> said foreign capital markets will force the next president to deal with these problems very early in his term or risk a precipitous drop in the dollar caused by foreign investors losing confidence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` You get a sense that foreign investors are waiting for Jan. 21 to see whether the next president will make the hard policy choices that will be needed,'' he said. The Council on Foreign Affairs is a research organization that conducts studies on international issues.

<HEAD>North's Lawyers Say Charges Rise From `Novel Theories'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers accused Iran-Contra prosecutors Wednesday of spinning `` novel theories of criminality'' to improperly charge the former presidential aide with illegal conduct. In a virtual blizzard of motions to dismiss the 16 counts against <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> lawyers </ORGANIZATION> argued that independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> `` formulated new legal doctrines criminalizing conduct in the sensitive areas of foreign affairs and interbranch relations.'' The defense also argued that the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide did not receive `` fair warning'' he could be prosecuted for making misleading statements in unsworn replies to congressional queries about covert aid to the Contras. Such charges are unprecedented and were not made after false statements by government officials about such covert operations as the U-2 spy plane shot down by the Russians in 1960 and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s support of <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> rebels in 1958, the defense contended Allegations that <PERSON> North </PERSON> and three co-defendants illegally diverted proceeds of U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels rest on the faulty premise that the conspiracy violated the congressional ban on aid to the Contras known as the <ORGANIZATION> Boland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amendment </ORGANIZATION>, the defense said. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> `` could not more blatantly _ or improperly _ formulate policies for the government'' than to charge <PERSON> North </PERSON> after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had determined that the Boland Amendment did not apply to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff, the defense said. Nor was the conspiracy to defraud the government of proceeds from the arms sales a valid charge because there is no proof that the government was deprived of its `` property right'' to the proceeds of those transactions, the defense said. The major charges `` rest on entirely novel theories of criminality and wholly unprecedented applications of substantive statutes,'' the defense said in filing 28 motions late Tuesday. The motions were note made public until Wednesday. Nine other motions were filed under seal. Defense lawyers noted that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s allegedly false statements denying his role in helping the Contras were made at an off-the-record session with members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> or were incorporated in written responses to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committees sent by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> never intended that an official could be charged for making unsworn statements, and <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s decision `` to prosecute such informal exchanges ... promises to transform interbranch relations by criminalizing the winks and nods that characterize interbranch communications,'' the defense said. Such charges impose on the executive branch `` the duty to be forthcoming to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on pain of criminal prosecution, not just political embarrassment,'' defense lawyers <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said in the pleadings. The defense motions also attacked the validity of charges that <PERSON> North </PERSON>, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and two arms dealers, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, defrauded the government by diverting arms-sale profits to the Contras. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> acted as an agent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and ensured that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> was paid the prices it charged for the weapons sold to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the defense said. The defendants therefore can not be charged with defrauding the government by diverting profits made during the arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the defense charged. Separate trials have been ordered for each of the defendants and <PERSON> North </PERSON> is set to be tried first. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has not set a trial date. A charge that <PERSON> North </PERSON> defrauded the government by using a tax-exempt foundation to help raise $ 3.2 million for the Contras rests on a controversial assumption that donations to the rebels could n't be deducted as charitable contributions from donors' income taxes, the defense said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> ignored `` repeated admonitions from the courts that ` pioneering interpretations' of tax liability should be pursued civilly rather than criminally,'' the defense said. The independent counsel `` stretched the limits of the conspiracy-to-defraud statute to charge Lt. Col. <PERSON> North </PERSON> on the basis of a legal theory that no court has ever endorsed.'' The retired Marine officer never received `` fair notice'' that his fund-raising would result in criminal prosecution, the defense contended.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> aboard a hijacked <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner tearfully told a court Wednesday that he was convinced his wife and children thought he had been killed during the 1985 air piracy. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also testified at the trial of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> that the Shiite Moslem and an accomplice raced through the plane beating passengers at random. The two Lebanese men seized the Athens-to-Rome flight on June 14, 1985, and diverted it to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. Thirty-nine Americans were held for 17 days during the ordeal. `` I was afraid that my wife and children thought I was dead,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, choking back tears. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 45, said he and other hostages were allowed to read magazines after they had been removed from the plane in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was shot by the hijackers and tossed out on the runway to die. The hijackers screamed `` Marine!'' at <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> while he was beaten and before he was shot, witnesses have said. `` At this time I realized that my wife had been told I was killed because I had been a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and it was published that a Marine had been killed,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is being tried for murder and air piracy in a heavily guarded courtroom in a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s Preungesheim prison, which is surrounded by police with submachine guns. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> described the first minutes after the jetliner was seized. `` One man had a pistol in one hand and a grenade in the other,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, referring to alleged kidnapper <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezzeddine </PERSON>, who is still at large. `` The other man -LRB- <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> -RRB- had a hand grenade in his hand. I saw a -LRB- grenade -RRB- pin on the floor of the plane, which to be honest with you, frightened the hell out of me,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. He said he saw the hijackers running through the plane striking passengers. `` I was able to see numerous times the brutality that both of the hijackers inflicted on the passengers. They were hitting them right and left.'' He said they sometimes leaned on the backs of seats and kicked passengers. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he was later taken off the plane in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> along with other passengers and taken to a `` slum house,'' where other captors interrogated them. `` We were taken later to an underground prison. For the first seven days we did not brush our teeth, or wash or change our clothes. There were no newspapers and no news,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The hostages were moved again to a third location where they were finally allowed to wash and read magazines, he said. He said the hijackers appeared well-trained for their mission. `` The initial movements to take over the plane were done with such professionalism ... that without a doubt they controlled that plane,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> sat quietly throughout the testimony, listening to his court-appointed interpreer. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who said he worked for a medical equipment company, was not asked by the court to reveal his residence under court guidelines for the protection of witnesses. On Tuesday, American <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> tearfully recounted how hijackers hit and kicked crouching passengers, including himself and his teen-age daughter. He also provided more description of how <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was severely beaten before he was fatally shot. `` His face was puffy. He was very raw or bloody in the neck area. He appeared to be dazed,'' said <PERSON> Byron </PERSON>, 52. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> said he did not see who fired the shot that killed <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> admits he was one of the hijackers but denies killing <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, have attended each session of the trial, which began July 5. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested Jan. 13, 1987, at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport after customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> last year rejected a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> extradition request for <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, saying he would be tried in this country instead.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has made a promise of universal health insurance a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to expand Medicaid coverage for the poor. But both candidates have shied away from detailed prescriptions for a host of other intractable medical problems that will confront the next president, from the AIDS crisis to long-term care to the soaring costs of Medicare. `` Health care is an issue that most Americans are very concerned about, and the candidates have not spent a lot of time on it,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>, legislative director for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>. Although neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has owned up to it, the $ 87 billion <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> program _ which provides health insurance for 28 million elderly and 3 million disabled workers _ is almost certain to be a prime target for deficit-reduction in the next <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Physicians' fees under <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> have risen at a 15 percent annual clip, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is already studying ways to move away from the traditional method of reimbursing doctors for whatever their customary charges are. `` They've been rather quiet about what they would do with <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. Our concern on Medicare is that you ca n't keep ratcheting that program down and expect access for the elderly to continue,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. But health analyst <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said, `` The next administration, if they're serious about budget control, has to put health care on the table.'' Americans spent $ 497 billion on health care in 1987, or 11.2 percent of the gross national product, a far larger share of GNP than any other industrialized country. Still, 37 million Americans have no health insurance, most of them in families with someone in the workforce. They are not old enough for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> nor, in most cases, poor enough for Medicaid. The ranks of the uninsured have grown rapidly over the past decade as insurance premiums surged in step with medical charges and as jobs with extensive fringe benefits disappeared in industries such as manufacturing. Hospitals and physicians once shifted the cost of caring for the uninsured onto those who could pay. But in recent years, both the government and third-party insurers such as <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> have balked at shouldering that burden. `` The paying patients are driving much harder bargains,'' said <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, president of a research firm called New Directions for Policy. `` It's much harder to bury these costs in somebody else's bill. Here is a look at the candidates' positions on uninsured people, long-term care and AIDS.

 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, calling it a disgrace that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the only industrialized country other than <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> without universal health insurance, proposes to help 22 million of the uninsured by backing legislation to order all but the smallest employers to arrange health insurance. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has also called for a $ 100 million program to provide medical and nutritional care to 200,000 pregnant women who lack insurance or Medicaid coverage. `` I want to make sure that quality, affordable health care is the birthright of every family and citizen in this land,'' says the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, whose state last April began requiring health insurance with most jobs. While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said this requirement would not cost the federal <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> anything, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has labeled it a $ 35 billion tax on business that could force thousands out of work. The vice president says he wants to allow poor people to buy into the $ 32 billion Medicaid program, which now covers 24 million of the needy. He has not offered all the specifics, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promises to press for mandatory Medicaid coverage for all children living in poverty, starting with infants. The Republican would phase in `` affordable coverage for pregnant women and infants up to 185 percent'' of the poverty line, and eventually cover older children as well, according to a position paper. Medicaid now covers less than half of all poor children, leaving 11 million unprotected. But expanding Medicaid will not be cheap. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> estimated it would cost $ 8 billion to $ 9 billion to cover all uninsured poor people.

<HEAD>LONG TERM CARE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 With 1.5 million people in nursing homes, typically paying more than $ 20,000 a year, long-term care is one of the biggest worries for older Americans and their families. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed tax incentives to encourage people to buy their own long-term-care group insurance and allowing people to convert their IRAs, savings accounts and life insurance to pay nursing home bills. For those who can not afford insurance, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> favors easing Medicaid requirements so they do n't have to spend their life savings before becoming eligible. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has endorsed Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>'s $ 7 billion-a-year plan to provide first-dollar coverage of long-term care at home. Pepper, the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Democrat, would pay for this coverage by levying the 1.45 percent payroll tax for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> on all wages instead of ending it at $ 45,000, effectively raising the payroll tax for 8 million workers. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has suggested guaranteeing Medicaid coverage for those who first exhaust private long-term insurance benefits.

<HEAD>AIDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says `` we may have to spend even more'' than the current $ 1 billion budget for the fight against the deadly virus, but `` money alone wo n't stop AIDS.'' He says education is crucial, including giving students the facts `` in a thoughtful, sensitive manner.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supports legislation `` that would make it a crime to discriminate against AIDS patients and those infected with the virus.'' He said AIDS test results must be kept `` appropriately confidential.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also supports a $ 1 billion-plus AIDS research and education budget. `` As president, I will educate the public about both the facts and the myths of this terrible disease,'' he said. Children should be taught about the disease as part of `` a comprehensive health education program beginnning in the early grades.''

<TEXT>
 It was just two months ago that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stood in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Statehouse and scorned Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for having `` some of the highest negatives ever recorded in American politics.'' He was referring to the percentage of people who rated the candidate unfavorably in public opinion polls. Two months later, it is <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> who has the high negatives. Polls released this week show the Democratic nominee's unfavorable rating now tops 40 percent, exceeding that of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Republicans say that means Americans do n't like what they see as they learn about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In no small way, though, they've learned about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> through strongly negative television ads and other attacks by Republicans. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has begun responding with his own negative assaults. On television commercials and in speeches, he belittles <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, accuses <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of plotting a `` raid'' on Social Security and says the vice president is a failed leader who lacks good judgment. All this is part of what frequently is lamented as the negative nature of the 1988 presidential race. Minor issues or outright distortions are given high-decibel treatment while hardly a whisper is heard about the national debt, relations with the Soviets, the AIDS epidemic or the hostages still held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Some blame <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for trivializing the presidential campaign. He has devoted weeks to attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over the Pledge of Allegiance, weekend furloughs for prison inmates, membership in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the governor's slowness in moving to clean up polluted <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. `` It is true _ it's a very negative campaign, and I say most of the blame lies with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, poliical observer at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative think tank. `` I say his campaign is probably the most disgraceful in modern American history,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> says. `` It is also working. It is both disgraceful and effective.'' The negative campaign should n't come as much of a surprise, though. Look what happened to two bad-luck candidates who talked about the deficit. Democrat <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> four years earlier, discovered to their chagrin that voters did n't want to hear about unpleasant realities. The negative campaign is hardly a 1988 phenomenon. `` It is more negative at an earlier stage than any presidential campaign I've seen,'' said Democratic consultant <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, who has been advising <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the debates. `` The 1980s have seen a real escalation in the use of negative advertising.'' <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> says it follows the pattern in <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and gubernatorial races. Democrats have become accustomed over the past eight years to facing intensely negative campaigns centered on a few emotional issues in state races. NCPAC, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, ran a series of campaigns in which Democratic incumbents were targeted with intensive negative television commercials on a few emotional issues. In 1984, Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> ran negative TV ads about his opponent for more than a year. The Democrats have learned to deal with such campaigns by responding forcefully. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, faced a <ORGANIZATION> NCPAC </ORGANIZATION> campaign in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in 1982, when he was seeking re-election. He fired back and won easily. On his campaign plane last weekend, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> expressed relief that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had finally begun responding with his own hard-hitting ads. `` Where have they been?'' he asked, holding out his arms in an expression of frustration at the delay. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign should have responded immediately when, after the Democratic convention in July, the Republicans began attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s record and even his patriotism. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had some help, too. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s reference to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as an `` invalid'' was quickly retracted _ but he succeeded in thrusting onto newspaper front pages the rumors that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had hidden mental problems in the past. The rumors were false, by all evidence. But the episode coincided with the beginning of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' summer slide in the polls. Some say <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his advisers are to blame for failing to anticipate many of the attacks, to recognize the visceral impact some were having and to respond before lasting damage was done. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, after all, has never run against a serious, conservative Republican campaign. `` One reason why he frittered away 17 points was because he did n't respond and did n't go hard negative himself,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>. `` You have to fight fire with fire. You ca n't sit there and take it. And you ca n't just occasionally respond and be defensive. You have to give your response immediately, in tough terms, and then go on the attack yourself. That's modern politics in a nutshell.'' The reason campaigns have grown increasingly negative is that such attacks work. The issues the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign selected seemed to resonate with voters as symbols of something larger and unsettling. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' values,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hopes to score similarly with his attacks on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, hoping it will register as a symbol of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment.

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 1,000 angry investors demonstrated Wednesday outside the ruling party headquarters to press the government to postpone or withdraw its plan to reimpose a stock profit tax. President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON> was chairing a meeting of the decision-making Central Standing Committee of his Nationalist, or Kuomintang, party at the time, but officials said the tax issue was not discussed. The protesters carried banners saying `` Hate!'' shouted `` Kuomintang Step Down!'' They threw bottles at riot police when the truck that had brought them soft drinks was towed away, and some held up a train for 30 minutes until they were driven off by the police. The nine-hour protest ended peacefully as protesters dispersed. No injuries were reported, but four protesters who fought police were arrested. Finance Minister <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuo </PERSON> reiterated Tuesday that the government will levy the tax next year after a 12-year freeze. The government says the tax is necessary to cool an overheated market jammed with speculative funds. Under the plan, investors must report in their annual income returns profits they have made from the sale of more than $ 103,400 in one year.

 A fire set by arsonists before dawn Wednesday severely damaged the headquarters of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, a staunch opponent of apartheid No one was injured, but an elderly nun and three other people in the building in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> were rescued from a balcony where they were trapped by flames. Three other people, including two bishops, fled down a fire escape. It was the second major attack in six weeks on offices of an anti-apartheid church organization. The headquarters of the South African Council of Churches in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> was wrecked by a bomb on Aug. 31. Police said four emptied containers of gasoline and paraffin were found in <LOCATION> Khanya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. The fire gutted the ground floor, where the organization's archives and print shop are located, and caused damage on two upper floors. Brother <PERSON> Jude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pieterse </PERSON>, general-secretary of the bishops' conference, said a parcel containing two unexploded limpet mines was found in the archives room when employees were allowed to re-enter the building at midday The bishops' conference said the arsonists `` must have known that the house was occupied and yet they went ahead, regardless of the consequences.'' `` We earnestly pray that the perpetrators of this foul act will be persued and brought to justice,'' it said. The bishops said the attack should be viewed in the context of a `` tragic mess in which our country and its people find themselves'' because of apartheid and racial discrimination. Those rescued from the second-floor balcony included three lay people attending a church meeting in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> and Sister <PERSON> Brigid </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, about 70, the associate general-secretary of the bishops' conference `` If it had n't been for the fast action of the fire department, we would have all been killed,'' said one of the four, <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>. Police said a minibus with 11 people inside, blacks and whites, was seen by a policeman outside <ORGANIZATION> Khanya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> shortly before the fire broke out about 2 a.m. The vehicle had a false license plate, police said. No arrests have been made in the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Khotso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, which housed the offices of the council of churches and other anti-apartheid organizations. Activists have suggested the bombing was carried out by right-wing vigilantes or a covert security force unit. A <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> lay commission affiliated to the bishops' conference said the arson attack was `` the work of ruthless right-wing urban guerrillas who seem to act with impunity.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is predominantly black. Conservative white Catholics have complained about the militant anti-apartheid stance of the bishops' conference. Two weeks ago, the bishops distributed a pastoral letter suggesting that Catholics consider not voting in this month's nationwide municipal elections Activists say the elections for segregated local councils entrench apartheid and bring blacks no closer to obtaining voting rights on the national level.

 <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> postponed its monthly meeting after a third councilman reported that vehicles were torched at his home and a bomb threat was called in to City Hall, officials said. The burnings began in May, when Mayor <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarborough </PERSON>'s 1985 Dodge Aries station wagon was set on fire and destroyed. On Oct. 2, fire destroyed a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Cutlass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> and a 1983 <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> 6000 owned by Vice Mayor <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. Councilman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariani </PERSON> was the latest victim, with fire destroying his daughter's 1987 Dodge Shadow and damaging his 1980 <PERSON> Datsun </PERSON> and a small truck he had borrowed to haul campaign signs. A bomb threat was reported at City Hall later in the day. The two other council members in this city near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> worry they're next. `` I'm not nearly as frightened for myself as I am for my family,'' said <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who is moving an antique <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> to another location as a precaution. `` If someone should come to my residence, I am prepared to do what I have to do. I am not a sheep. I'll leave it at that.'' Police patrols will be increased around the homes of all five council members, said City Manager <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>. Tuesday's council meeting was rescheduled for next week. Police and fire investigators say they have no suspects and no motive, which could be something as simple as anger over a zoning decision. `` To me, it's really hard to grasp what the motive is,'' Fire Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherry </PERSON> said. `` Is it because it's an incumbent council or because they're candidates or what?'' <PERSON> Mariani </PERSON> was awakened to the blaze in his driveway shortly after 3 a.m. Tuesday by a neighbor's barking dog. On his way outside, <PERSON> Mariani </PERSON> said, he heard a door slam and a car speed away. With help from neighbors and passers-by, <PERSON> Mariani </PERSON> kept the flames from reaching his house until firefighters arrived. `` This is crazy. You just do n't do things like this,'' said <PERSON> Mariani </PERSON>, who has been on the City Council off and on for 11 years and is running for mayor this year. `` I'm just numb.

 A former volunteer firefighter was arrested and charged in connection with one of the arson fires that have brought months of fear and sleepless nights to this town, police said today. Plainclothes police officers hustled <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON>, 23, into the police station in neighboring <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION> this afternoon, and he was arraigned in district court there later on a single felony arson charge. Since May, 21 fires have been set in the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> town of 850 people _ months marked by anger, sadness, worry and suspicion. No one has been injured, but there have been some close calls. The fire for which <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> was charged occurred Aug. 23 at his brother's home. It was the 19th in the series of fires. Officials declined to comment on whether <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> was a suspect in any other of the fires. State police scheduled a news conference for later in the day. The charge filed today was based on a state police complaint. At arraignment in <ORGANIZATION> Lancaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> set bail at $ 50,000 cash. State police have released few details of their investigation, which includes members of the state fire marshal's office, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> and help from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> was taken to a nearby state police barracks, his brother <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> told the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Coos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION>. After the fire broke out at <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s home in August, <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> reported it and was trying to put it out when others arrived. He was questioned for eight hours and police searched his home and car, but he was not arrested at the time. In interviews with the Democrat, he denied involvement in the fires. <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> was asked to quit <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s volunteer fire deparment when he moved to nearby <LOCATION> Groveton </LOCATION>. He has since moved back to <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> where he works nights as a dishwasher at a restaurant. The blazes changed the rhythm of life in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION>. Many families began sleeping in shifts and abandoned vacation and social plans. Some residents began nighttime patrols to try to catch the arsonist. Guns were left by the door in many homes. As the months passed, the initial shock became tempered by anger and, for some, resignation. The vigils persist but have in recent weeks been tinged with the knowledge that this exhausting nocturnal life can not continue forever. `` I have a feeling we're developing the same callus you develop in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, a state senator and <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> resident, before today's arrest was announced. `` If a car bomb is going to blow up in front of your house, it's going to happen. You're scared, but you have to live with it.'' The volunteer fire department's 32 current members and 12 other people have taken polygraph tests. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> has no police force. In all of the village's 52 square miles of scenic meadows, woods and hills, there are only 363 residences and three blocks. Now the vistas are pockmarked by burned-out shells, some on back roads and many on main thoroughfares. Most of the fires were set late at night, many at the back of the buildings. They began with brush and fields, then escalated to barns, empty homes and occupied homes. No one has been killed or seriously hurt, though some barely escaped with their lives and some have lost their homes. A mother of two, normally softspoken, now bites off her words with anger. `` I want this person to suffer. I want him caught so he can hurt a little, like we have,'' said the woman, who like many residents spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s families have prepared for each restless night by activating lights around their homes that come on automatically when they sense motion and letting porch lights burn through the darkness. Some settle in for nightlong vigils of coffee, nerves and sleeplessness. Unmarked patrol cars cruise the village on their way to back roads. Police routinely stop cars traveling through town at night and ask for license and registration. Tourists flocking to see <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>'s famous fall foliage are surprised to learn this is the town they've seen on national television and have read about in newspapers. Despite the natural beauty, many residents are hoping autumn will pass quickly and winter snowfall will either make it easier to track down the arsonist or deter him. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrigan </PERSON>, publisher of the Democrat, disagrees. `` I do n't want it to snow and I do n't want the fires to stop,'' said <PERSON> Harrigan </PERSON>, whose home was damaged by a fire set in early August. `` One more fire could mean one more mistake'' by the arsonist, leading to an arrest.

 A study of AIDS virus screening among military recruits found that only one was wrongly identified as infected, discounting fears that too many people will be mislabeled if there is widespread testing, a researcher said. `` The public should know that if they choose to, they can do early diagnosis of HIV infection cheaply, they can do it in a logistically feasible way and they can do it with a great deal of accuracy,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redfield </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The latest findings, published in Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, were based on the first 20 months of military screening of all recruits. Just one of the 135,187 people tested from rural areas was misclassified as infected. The test, which reveals the presence of antibodies formed when a person is exposed to the AIDS virus, is used to screen donated blood and also offered by public health agencies to check those at high risk of the disease, such as homosexual men and drug addicts. Many of those testing positive for the virus will go on to develop acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a crippling of the body's immune system that leaves a person prey to life-threatening cancers and infections. There is no cure. Experts disagree over whether HIV screening should remain largely voluntary or whether it should be expanded to include mandatory testing, in some situations, of people at low risk of AIDS, such as hospital patients. Opponents argue that, among other things, such broad testing could falsely label many healthy people as infected. For instance, Dr. <PERSON> Klemens </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> has suggested that of every 10 low-risk people with positive AIDS tests, nine of them might actually be free of the virus. <PERSON> Redfield </PERSON>, who is one of the nation's most persistent advocates of widespread testing, said the latest findings show this is untrue. He believes doctors should routinely check for AIDS just as they do for cancer, heart disease and other illnesses. He suggests that AIDS screening be part of routine testing of hospital patients, pregnant women, marriage license applicants and clients of venereal disease and drug abuse programs. The aim is to spot the HIV infection early, when its symptoms can often be controlled and when carriers can be persuaded not to spread the disease to others. Dr. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Fineberg </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said that while the latest data help build the case for widespread screening, they are `` not sufficient to shift the balance altogether.'' Issues of confidentiality of test results and possible discrimination against infected people still must be settled, he said. Promoting condom and spermicide use, fighting drug abuse and providing clean needles are more economical ways to stop the spread of AIDS. Dr. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> agreed that despite the test's accuracy, it should remain voluntary, at least for now. `` There is no overwhelmingly compelling reason at this moment to endorse mandatory widespread population screening,'' she said, `` because the answer to the question, ` What is the purpose of the test, and what would you do with the results?' is unclear. There is no treatment. There is no way to ensure that people will change their behavior and not spread the disease.'' Others question whether commercial labs will perform the AIDS test as accurately as the military. Dr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Miike </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged the military's `` phenomenally high accuracy rate'' but added: `` I'm not worried about them. I'm worried about labs that advertise, ` Come get your HIV test.' I get calls from people who say they are the victims of false positives.'' <PERSON> Klemens </PERSON> agreed. `` The question is not how well the best laboratories can do,'' he said. `` The issue is how well most laboratories are performing, whether they will maintain this performance and whether it is good enough.'' To this, <PERSON> Redfield </PERSON> responded, `` I think it's an unusual time when the Department of Defense can do things cheaper, quicker and more accurate than the private sector.'' <PERSON> Redfield </PERSON> said the military testing has actually improved since the first 20 months of the program, and mistakenly false results are now probably only one in 1 million. He said the test costs $ 3 per person, and the results are ready within three days. There have been 74,809 cases of AIDS reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since June 1981, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>'s Oct. 6 statistics, with 42,142 deaths, or 56 percent of all cases.

 Sobs rose to the choir loft of a small-town church as caskets were closed at a funeral service Wednesday for three of the five seventh-grade girls killed when a speeding car jumped a curb and struck them. About 1,000 people, many of them young, filled the <ORGANIZATION> Assumption </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blessed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> for the joint funeral for <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hylok </PERSON>, both 13, and <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Watia </PERSON>, one month shy of her 13th birthday. Services were scheduled later Wednesday for the other two victims, <PERSON> Jodi </PERSON> <PERSON> Prokop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeefry </PERSON>, both 13. The Rev. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuczwara </PERSON> told mourners they could cry and then go back to their lives, or thank God for the gift of the girls' short lives and learn something from them `` Thirteen years young, but old enough to achieve something,'' he said, adding that the girls needed no drugs or alcohol but found happiness in their friends, family and faith. `` Remember students, do n't cry for them. ... Cry for those who are looking for other ways to find happiness,'' <PERSON> Kuczwara </PERSON> said. Many sobbed as the three caskets were closed. The girls were killed Friday night when a <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> traveling at an estimated 70 mph jumped a curb, sheared a utility police and struck them on a sidewalk along a residential street about two blocks from the police station. Investigators planned to check the car for possible mechanical problems and to investigate whether the 17-year-old driver, a diabetic, may have suffered a seizure, said Police Chief Reed <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>. No alcohol was involved, he said. The driver, who was a distant relative of <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcz </PERSON>, was listed in critical condition Monday at a <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> hospital. Hospital officials said his parents had asked them not to release further reports on his condition. His 11-year-old sister, who was a passenger in the car, was also seriously injured. At a memorial service for the girls Tuesday night, 2,000 people who gathered at the <ORGANIZATION> Pulaski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> gymnasium heard condolences from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and a tape of one of the victims singing rock star <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>'s song, `` Could've Been.'' `` The flowers you gave me are just about to die. When I think of what could have been, it makes me want to cry,'' sang the high-pitched young voice of <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Watia </PERSON>. Mourners hugged and sobbed as the recording was played.

 Under legislation approved Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a commission will recommend by Dec. 31 which of the nation's military installations should be closed. The commission will examine all 3,800 military facilities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, although it will concentrate on the 550 largest installations, those which each employ more than 300 civilians. No list, either official or unofficial, has been released by the commission, legislators noted Wednesay. Thus there is no way to yet know which bases might be closed. But critics have long pointed to a trio of bases which they say represent facilities that could be closed with little harm to the nation's defense. The three are <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, built more than a century ago to protect stagecoach routes; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, built inside a moat to defend against the British invasion in the War of 1812; and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sheridan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, where the major features are a golf course and two beaches on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Another potential facility to be closed may be <ORGANIZATION> Loring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base in northern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> base which the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> proposed closing in 1975. It was that proposal which prompted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to erect stiff hurdles against base closings. In 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> prepared a list of bases which it said could be closed. That list will likely be reviewed by the commission. The 1985 list included <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Devens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wingate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Depot </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Blytheville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, Ark.; the refueling wing at <ORGANIZATION> McConnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cumberland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Letterkenny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Hotline To Help With Care Of Latchkey Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A year-old program to promote the safety of so-called latchkey children who are home alone while their parents work is being expanded to include a tollfree hotline to a national resource center, organizers said Wednesday. Parents and other adults seeking information about the care of school-age children can call a hotline for `` Project Home Safe,'' a national program developed by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and financed by the <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The three-year project began a year ago and provides research, training, materials and standards on how to improve the care of school-age youth. The term `` latchkey children'' dates back to the 19th century when working-class children who were on their own wore their house keys on neck chains. <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>, the association's research unit administrator, said at a news conference that today's latchkey children number an estimated 6.5 million and cross racial, ethnic, economic and geographic lines. She was joined by Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., who said few families can attain the `` American dream'' of children, college, home ownership, cars and health insurance on just one income anymore `` We have to deal with reality, not with nostaligia,'' she said. During its first year, <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safe </ORGANIZATION> trained health care professionals who will work with home economists, parents, teachers and children in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, Ark; and <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Training sites in the second year will include <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sation </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> The tollfree number to reach the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> resource center is 1-800-252-SAFE. It is not designed for children.

 The four Panamanian members of the commission that operates the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> boycotted the quarterly meeting Wednesday in protest of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies toward the military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s rule. It was the second time since January the four have refused to attend, but the five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> members were able to conduct business. `` It does deprive the commission of the input of the Panamanian members with regard to Panamanian interests,'' commission Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gianelli </PERSON> said. At Wednesday's daylong, closed session, he said, members discussed the commission's $ 500 million budget and details of moving dependents of some 1,100 canal commission employees back home to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should they decide to voluntarily leave during the current tensions between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, the nation's most liberal republic, accused <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> again Wednesday of fanning ethnic turmoil that has combined with economic chaos to create a political crisis. The attack by <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON>, on nationalist rallies by Serbs came the day after <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> party leader <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> made a strong defense of the mass demonstrators, at which supporters often shout his name. <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON> told the Slovene party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>: `` It is not hard to kindle fires of political, nationalist, social and other passions, but one should also think about what remains after the fire. Burned-out structures take time to be covered with oblivion. `` It is the final hour for sobering up, for halting insanity which is driving us to destruction, and the last moment to stop those who are using and manipulating people's misfortunes.'' Weeks of strikes, public protest and ethnic unrest have plagued <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, which has not had strong leadership since President <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> died in 1980. Inflation running at an annual rate of 217 percent, the foreign debt is $ 21 billion and 15 percent of Yugoslav workers are unemployed. Austerity measures imposed in May have cut real wages while prices continue to rise. The split in the Slavic camp between Serbs and Slovenes is part of political maneuvering before a meeting of the national party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Oct. 17, which is expected to produce a showdown and leadership changes <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> national </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, promised a major shakeup after protesting throngs demanded the resignation of leaders blamed by workers and farmers for the worst economic crisis since World War II. There is broad consensus that radical economic reform is needed but the ethnic unrest, which developed into anti-government demonstrations last weekend, has split the leaderships of the national and regional parties. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> consists of six republics and two autonomous provinces, each with its own government and party structure. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> is the largest republic and both provinces, <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>, are part of its territory. Tito specified the decentralized system of government and collective federal presidency in his 1974 constitution to prevent one republic from gaining sway over the others, but the result has been ineffective government by compromise. <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON> urged national party members Wednesday to avoid a wholesale purge, which he said would not solve the nation's problems He said mass protests Oct. 6-7 brought <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> `` to the threshhold'' of `` an extraordinary situation'' in which some elements in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, left unidentified, would have welcomed military intervention. `` Do the proponents of these demands indeed fail to see that they only support the suspesion of the legal, legitimate system?'' he asked. In a direct attack on the Serbian leadership, which on Monday attacked the Slovenian party's weekend statement criticizing <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON> denounced `` the vehemence, aggression and the unsubstantiated nature of the reaction of the comrades from <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>.'' A meeting between members of the national party's ruling Politburo and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leadership of ethnically troubled <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province ended early Wednesday with no resolution of Serbian demands for the dismissal of three senior <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> party figures. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> made the demand Tuesday in the meeting in which <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> defended mass rallies of Serbs. Slavic residents of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, a southern province adjacent to <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, claim they are victimized by ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s population.

 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, who has been bedridden with intestinal hemorrhaging for three weeks, has grown weaker as his anemia and jaundice worsen, <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> officials and news reports said Wednesday. Doctors gave the 87-year-old emperor more blood in an attempt to reduce the anemia, said <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Officials said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s strength was declining because doctors were unable to supply enough nutrients through intravenous feeding. The emperor, the world's longest-reigning monarch, has not been able to eat anything except for two ice cubes and a few spoonfuls of porridge since his condition worsened Sept. 19. Although the emperor did not discharge any blood Wednesday, a Palace official said Wednesday he could not rule out the possibility of internal bleeding from his intestine. Palace officials have refused to confirm or deny news reports that <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has cancer in his upper digestive system, and they have urged the media to refrain from such speculation. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> announced that Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> has postponed a planned trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> because of the emperor's illness. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> was to visit Oct. 20-25 to mark the 10th anniversary of a peace and friendship treaty between the two countries. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has no political power but serves as a symbol of the unity of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

 The hunt crossed three continents and required hundreds of computers, but a team of researchers captured a prize few thought possible _ the prime factors of the 100-digit number on mathematicians' `` most wanted'' list. The breakthrough could have important implications for governments and banks, which use large-digit numbers in security systems on the assumption they provide a code too difficult to break. But the pleasure of the hunt concerned researchers more. `` Why did we go after it?'' <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> computer scientist <PERSON> Arjen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenstra </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Because people compile lists.'' The number, which begins 9,412,343,607 ... and stretches on for 90 more digits, defied all previous efforts to find its prime factors. The factors of a number are two numbers that, when multiplied together, yield the larger number. A prime number is one that is evenly divisible only by 1 or itself. The prime factors of 21, for example, are 3 and 7. By comparison, the prime numbers that solved the 100-digit number are, respectively, 41 digits and 60 digits long. Finding the prime factors of such large numbers was thought to be so difficult, in fact, that many security systems assume such computations to be beyond the range of even the most powerful computers being applied for long periods of time. Governments transfer secret messages and banks transfer funds electronically by encoding the information in large-digit numbers that require the receiver to know its prime factors in order to decipher the information. `` Ten years ago, everybody suggested 80 digits were safe. Nowadays, that's trivial'' said <PERSON> Lenstra </PERSON>, co-director of the project with Dr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Manasse </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` I think 150 is reasonable,'' he continued. `` But personally, I'd go a little beyond 200 now.'' Computer scientists had theorized that a single computer doing a million calculations per second would have needed 25 years to solve the problem. Even a state-of-the-art supercomputer such as the <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> would need about 10 months of constant computing _ that at a cost of thousands of dollars per hour. <PERSON> Lenstra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Manasse </PERSON>, however, factored the number in just 26 days. They began their attack on the 100-digit number by breaking the problem into smaller tasks, then farmed them out to about 400 computers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> through an exisiting electronic mail network. All the computers used in the project worked on the factoring problem only when they were not being used for anything else. Each time a problem was solved, it was relayed by electronic mail to <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> lab. The last sequence of numbers required to solve the entire problem flashed across a computer screen at 2:03 a.m. PDT Tuesday. `` One of the really nice things about this effort is that it cost us virtually nothing,'' <PERSON> Lenstra </PERSON> said. `` We contacted friends, other computer scientists, anybody that thought factoring was fun and got them to participate.'' <PERSON> Lenstra </PERSON>, 32, a visiting professor in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s computer science department is unsure where the next horizon lies. He said every time the length of the number goes up by three digits, the time needed to compute the prime factors doubles. `` But we do n't know what our problem-solving limit is until we find out how much interest is out there and how big an electronic mail network we can assemble. `` We've already started on a 102-digit number,'' he concluded, `` just to keep us busy.''

<HEAD>Organizers of Charity `Race Against Time' Go Into Liquidation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The future of the biennial `` Race Against Time,'' which raised millions of dollars for the world's poor, hung in the balance Wednesday when its sponsor went into voluntary liquidation. Sport for <ORGANIZATION> Sport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the series of six-mile road runs in 128 countries, relied on sales of T-shirts, entry fees and television videos to pay for administrative costs. Sport Aid blamed its collapse on an August mail strike in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> that hampered the distribution of sponsorship forms. Only 215,000 Britons, one-third the expected turnout, took part in the Sept. 11 event. The charity backed by the company, <ORGANIZATION> Sport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, `` is unaffected and is still receiving money,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cater </PERSON>. The company owes creditors $ 3.9 million, Cater said. The accounting firm <ORGANIZATION> Deloitte </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON> and Sells has been appointed to clear the company's debts. Money raised by people who took part in the Race Against Time wo n't be used to pay off creditors, said a spokeswoman who requested anonymity. `` The question of whether we will be back and do it all again depends on the people on the ground and those who took part,'' he said. `` They put heart and soul into the event. They will decide what is to happen.'' The first Sport Aid race, on May 25, 1986, attracted nearly 20 million runners in 89 countries and raised more than $ 35 million for African famine victims. The amount raised by Sport Aid'88 will not be known until the end of the year, Cater said. A third race had been planned for 1990.

<HEAD>EPA To Permit Some Cancer-Causing Pesticides If Risk Negligible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it will permit the use of cancer-causing pesticides whose residues on foods are increased during processing if the risk of cancer is negligible. The agency so far has interpreted the so-called `` <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> clause'' barring cancer-causing food additives as requiring it to refuse new pesticide licenses for such chemicals. The reversal of policy is in line with one of the recommendations of a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> panel last year. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy administrator, said the change clears the way for decisions on 73 old pesticides, licensed when standards were looser, for which there is some evidence of cancer-causing power. It also may permit the licensing of weakly carcinogenic new chemicals which might be safer than current compounds. At least a dozen chemicals are known to be in the second group, but not all have current license applications pending. `` If you do n't let -LRB- the new chemical -RRB- on the market there'll never be an opportunity'' to retire the old one, either through regulations or competitive pressure, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said Asked if he was arguing that the new policy would mean safer food, he replied: `` Yes. That's not a conclusion the agency came to by itself; it's also the conclusion of the academy report.'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s new policy defines as `` negligible risk'' a maximum one-in-a-million chance of getting cancer from the residue in question over a lifetime. Environmentalists denounced the action. `` We are horrified,'' said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` It amounts to rewriting the <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> clause and completely gutting the <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> clause.'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Misuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pesticides </ORGANIZATION>, said a one-in-a-million standard might be acceptable in principle, but not for a single pesticide considered apart from all the others. `` The agency has no proposal to curtail additive risk. ... we're talking about significant exposure'' when all chemicals are considered, he said The `` <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> clause,'' named for its 1958 sponsor, then-Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, is in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION>, Drug and Cosmetic Act It bars the use of any food additive shown to cause cancer in `` man or animal.'' The act classifies as additives those pesticides whose residue is concentrated during processing. The same act requires <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to set maximum permissible concentrations for pesticide residues on both raw and processed food, and no pesticide leaving a residue may be used if such a tolerance has not been established. The <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> clause does not apply to raw foods, and under the separate pesticide law <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> can permit the use of pesticides that cause cancer if the benefits outweigh the risk. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> was rebuffed in court in trying to use a similar one-in-a-million `` negligible risk'' standard for food coloring under the <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> clause, but <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the court `` went out of its way to point out that the language of the Cosmetic Act ... may not apply directly to food additives associated with pesticide use.'' The old chemicals of which <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> spoke, about 50 of which are known to concentrate during processing, have been in a regulatory limbo for several years. These and many other chemicals were licensed when standards were much looser. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> since the late 1970s has been gathering data from laboratory animal and other tests to re-license all 656 chemicals used as active ingredients in pesticides. About 300 are used on foods. New data for the 73 chemicals showed `` if we were to apply a rigid <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> approach those old pesticides would have to come off the market,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. A `` zero risk -LRB- policy -RRB- is totally infeasible as we sit here today. There would be so many pesticide uses being curtailed we'd cause dramatic and deep disruption in the food supply,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said Both Ms. <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> and <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has been obliged all along to use the <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> clause against old pesticides when new data become available, regardless of whether the clause bars licensing of certain new chemicals.

<HEAD>Coalition Including Farm Groups Joins Pesticide Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumer, environmental and farm groups launched Wednesday a drive for further tightening of curbs on the use of chemical pesticides on the nation's crops. `` We are drenching our food and drowning the nation in an ever-increasing amount of agricultural chemicals,'' declared <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, director of the newly launched <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toxics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>. The coalition was billed at a news conference as a switch from past campaigns to curb pesticides in which environmentalists and farmers have found themselves at odds. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> officials on hand praised the coalition's stress on restricting the supply of farm crops _ and thus raising farm prices _ as a prelude to scaling back pesticide use. Absent were the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> and other groups that traditionally represent a broad sweep of agribusiness as well as politically influential producer groups, such as the corn, wheat and soybean growers associations. Many farmers remain opposed to additional pesticide curbs and chilly toward environmentalists. Environmentalists have been campaigning for 26 years for tightened controls over pesticides, citing evidence that more than 50 basic ingredients in chemicals sprayed on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crops cause cancer in laboratory animals as well as an array of other health problems. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last month approved legislation that would set a nine-year deadline for completion of safety testing by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> of more than 600 active ingredients in pesticides. At the current pace, the job would take until the year 2024, congressional investigators estimate. Even sponsors of the legislation, however, have been painting it as a bare-bones measure that represented merely the best compromise that could be reached for the time being. They have been urging action next year to combat increasing pesticide contamination of groundwater _ the basic drinking supply for an estimated 113 million Americans. At its news conference, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toxics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> issued a 35-page report detailing the pesticide problem. It mainly represented a recycling of data that have appeared in previous documents examining the issue. It called for both control of the supply of agricultural commodities and a program of `` integrated pest management,'' as well as new pesticide curbs. Supply management, opposed by many farm groups, would go into effect under legislation sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>. Its aim is to prevent enormous surpluses that drive down farm prices. A few groups, such as the National Save the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, have long been campaigning for such a measure, which was nevertheless shelved early in the current session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. They say better farm prices would offset production losses as a result of reduced reliance on pesticides. `` Family farmers are ready to reduce their use of expensive and dangerous chemicals _ but federal policies stand in our way,'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Denser </PERSON> of the Family Farm coalition told the news conference. Consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, also on hand for the news conference, said keeping families on the farm was an important goal to avoid `` oligarchy domination of agribusiness plantations.'' Integrated pest managment, another goal of the coalition, stands for a variety of techniques such as reduced pesticide use, tilling in a manner that protects crops from pests and scouting farm fields to avoid needless spraying. Federal monitoring of pesticides in groundwater and an array of other measures left out of this year's pesticide bill also are being advocated by the coalition as part of a farm bill that may be written next year. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said congressional candidates received more than $ 4 million in campaign contributions from pesticide manufacturers over the last five years. The contributions were made by political action committees operated by 21 member companies of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents pesticide manufacturers, the Capitol Hill-based group said. It noted the chemical companies' opposition to groundwater provisions supported by most environmentalists `` There is a strong correlation between chemical company ... contributions to a politician and that politician's vote on regulatiion of the chemical industry,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hind </PERSON> of the research group. He said the chemical companies were `` applying agricultural techniques to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> _ they sow campaign contributions and reap legislation that allows them to operate with minimal government oversight.''

 Soldiers blew up four Palestinian homes and sealed five others Wednesday in reprisal for the murder of Arabs who collaborated with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Palestinians hurled a grenade at a troop bus but missed. Noting an increased use of guns and grenades by <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists, Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> suggested there had been a shift in Palestinian tactics from stones to more sophisticated weapons. `` Once they shift from civilian violence to terror for me it is proof that they failed to achieve their goals by what they call the intefadeh,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said, using the Arabic word for uprising. But clashes continued in the occupied territories. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported seven Palestinians wounded, four in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and three in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, sources said a grenade was thrown between a bus carrying soldiers and a civilian car. The army said no injuries resulted, and soldiers sealed the area and detained a number of Palestinians. A day earlier, a grenade was thrown at an army jeep, wounding two soldiers in the legs. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, speaking to a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> luncheon, noted Wednesday's incident was the third time grenades had been hurled in the recent days and that a village leader had been shot to death with an assault rifle by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> enforcers. He said terror attacks had declined in the occupied lands in the past 10 months as <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists focused on large-scale demonstrations and stone-throwing confrontations. But the defense minister said the army had succeeded in stopping big protests and in recent days there had been a upsurge in the use of bullets, bombs and grenades. `` It represents a failure by them to create a number of violent incidents by simple means, and therefore a beginning by this small group to return to terror as it was used in the past,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. The army did not identify the group behind the latest grenade attacks, but <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> journalists in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> said rumors circulated that the attacks were the work of Islamic militants. Palestinian sources said <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> was not involved, and prominent Palestinians said they were not aware of any change in <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> policy. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders have said Palestinian protesters had access to weapons but had been instructed not to use them in confrontations with Israelis. The restraint has won Palestinians international sympathy, and the embargo on terror is an essential ingredient for any <LOCATION> Palestinian-Israeli </LOCATION> dialogue after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Nov. 1 general election. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said he believed the use of bullets by Palestinians may be an effort to prod <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders into taking a stand politically on negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But many of the recent casualties have coincided with stepped-up arrest raids and the introduction of plastic bullets. Since the beginning of the month, 15 Palesitinans have been killed and scores wounded, raising the overall death toll to 295 since the uprising began Dec. 8. Ten suspected Arab collabators with Israeli authorities have been killed since last December, including three who were stabbed to death in recent weeks in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, about 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Soldiers blew up four houses in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and sealed five others. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, military commander of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, said the houses belonged to Palestinian members of a group responsible for killing the Arabs who cooperated with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has asked <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to stop the policy of blowing up houses because it is done without court hearings. A pool of Israeli reporters witnessed the house-blowing operation Wednesday, but foreign reporters and photographers were banned. <PERSON> Roni </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaked </PERSON>, a reporter for the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION>, saw the explosions and said the early morning reaction prompted immediate protests. `` Immediately after the blast, before the column of smoke rose up to the sky, terrible shouts came from all the windows and doorways of the neighborhood,'' he said. The reporter said there were calls of `` Allahu Akbar!'' _ Arabic for `` God is great!'' `` It was a call for battle, for revenge ... for many long minutes this call hung in the air along with many whistles,'' he said. The city of 120,000 has been under curfew since violent riots erupted Friday after rumors circulated that Israeli troops had opened fire on a mosque, killing four Palestinians, and killed another Palestinian who had his arms bound behind his back. The army denied soldiers shot into a mosque and the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted the army as saying soldiers had handcuffed a prisoner, not realizing in the dark that he had been wounded. He later died.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> engaged in some light preparation on Wednesday for a second nationally televised presidential debate he said would show Americans `` what my heartbeat is, what I really care about.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sandwiched several hours of debate preparation in between a morning jog and a baseball playoff game at night. The Republican presidential nomineee expressed confidence about Thursday's second nationally televised debate with rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and told reporters: `` We do seem to be looking a little stronger politically these days.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said the vice president planned only several hours of debate preparation with aides Wednesday and would not have any further mock debates. The last such sessions occurred Tuesday morning and last Saturday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with sparring partner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, a former deputy treasury secretary. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to take off the rest of the day to attend the seventh and deciding game at Dodger Stadium in the National League Championship series between <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION>. Asked by reporters what he hoped to accomplish in the second debate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` What I want to is have them -LRB- Americans -RRB- understand what my heartbeat is, what I really care about.'' He said those areas included `` foreign affairs, the defense of this country, world peace, how I as president would build on that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added that he planned to cite fewer statistics in the debate and talk more on `` how I would like to lead this country, where I'd like to see us be in the nineties if I'm elected president.'' `` So I want to spell it out on that broader sense this time, and let the others nitpick on all these other little numbers and statistics,'' he said. He denied anew that he had been engaging in negative campaigning against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying: `` What I have to do is make him be what he is, and that he seems reluctant to do, and then I've got to be what I am. And that second part is what I really want to concentrate on at this debate. `` He ca n't run away from his past, he ca n't say today that he's mainstream when he's been on the left-hand spectrum of the American political process. The vice president also jogged for about 20 minutes in a municipal park with about a dozen students from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, who all wore Bush-Quayle T-shirts. In a briefing for reporters, Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was n't worried about the possibility of a surprise blow from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` He's pretty good at dodging and weaving,'' she said. `` I do n't think we'll worry too much about unexpected blows. She also said she doubted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would rely heavily on one-liners in this debate. `` It ought not to be reduced to some kind of show-business sting of one-liners,'' she said. `` And if it is, the voters wo n't get as much out of it. `` Weeks of stories about handlers and crafting one-liners and strategic responses takes a toll. I think they lose some credibility.'' Comparing this debate with the last one, she said, `` we rate them pretty much the same.'' And, she warned, do n't expect to see a different <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this time around. `` What you see pretty much is what you get,'' she said. `` You're not going to see an entirely different type of debate from his standpoint.

<TEXT>
 Former Cambodian head of state Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said Wednesday after meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that moderate elements of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> should be included in a new coalition government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> once Vietnamese troops withdraw. While restating his view that <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> leaders who were responsible for `` genocide'' against the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people a decade ago must be excluded, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said moderate elements could be included in a new `` collegial system.'' `` Then we could control them,'' <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, adding that to exclude all elements of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> would `` make them bandits.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which is believed to have killed between 1 million and 2 million Cambodians during their 1975-78 rule, is one of three factions fighting the Vietnamese-backed government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. Based on his talks here, which included a meeting Tuesday with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said his view of the situation in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and that of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are `` practically the same.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> reaffirmed the longstanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position that elements of an acceptable settlement include a complete withdrawal of Vietnamese forces and the emergence of a coalition government `` not dominated by any faction.'' `` We simply can not see a return to power of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, who was deposed in a 1970 military coup, reaffirmed his view that leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> should be exiled, perhaps in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` But they must not participate in the new government. Only the ones who are the moderates who are not responsible for the genocide should be accepted,'' he said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is providing $ 5 million in non-lethal assistance to the two anti-communist rebel groups and is consulting with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the possibility of an increase. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has set a 1990 deadline for completing a withdrawal of its troops. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is said to be the strongest of the three factions fighting the pro-Vietnamese government and a major international effort is under way to ensure that that group does not play a dominant role in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s future political evolution. Particularly active in this effort have been the six members of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> _ <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>. One of the measures being discussed to limit the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> role is the establishment of an international peacekeeping force. Other measures under discussion include the disarming of all Cambodian factions and removing leading <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> figures from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.

 Friends of <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowdell </PERSON> predicted she would `` scream and squeal'' when she returned home from vacation and found her newly refurbished house. They were right. `` Oh man, this is neat!'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dowdell </PERSON> yelled Tuesday as she walked through her home in northeast <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The cabinets were neat. The dishwasher was neat, the curtains were neat, the carpet was neat. `` This is God's doing,'' she hollered. `` God is neat, buddy.'' And so, it seems, are many of Mrs. <PERSON> Dowdell </PERSON>'s fellow Faith Tabernacle church members. When she left town on vacation last month, the congregation moved in to fix her dilapidated house. When Mrs. <PERSON> Dowdell </PERSON>, 63, left to visit relatives, the house had a leaky roof, holes in the walls, gaps in the plumbing and hazards in the wiring. When she returned, her house smelled of fresh paint and hummed with new appliances. The church traditionally does such projects in other states and in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, said mission team leader <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>. This time, the church decided to do its work closer to home, for one of their own, favorite members. Her friends first put on a new roof and installed new sheetrock. Then a carpenter decided he could repair the windows, and a mason took a look at the brick, and someone brought by a new water heater. D.A. Counce, who supervised the project, estimates the donations included between 3,000 and 4,000 working hours and cash contributions of $ 1,100. Counce figured the job, if contracted out, would have cost $ 30,000.

<HEAD>Squabble Delays Negotiations on House-Senate Tax Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With time running out on the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> dispute over non-tax amendments delayed negotiations Wednesday on a compromise package of tax cuts and increases. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he doubts the bill can become law this year unless negotiators complete their work on Friday But squabbling over some <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> amendments delayed even the appointment of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators, who would be led by <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>. The delay forced cancellation of a scheduled negotiating session Wednesday. At issue are amendments protecting the <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Battlefield </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> against some commercial development, and proposed sanctions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for using poison gas against some minority citizens. The <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> amendment is under jurisdiction of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; the <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> amendment falls under the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Those committees could be expected to demand representation among the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators, which <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> opposes. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, said he expected the problem to be worked out, possibly in time for negotiators to begin work Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills are designed primarily to correct errors in the 1986 tax overhaul. They also include dozens of other amendments that cut some taxes and raise others. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill would raise about $ 3 billion over three years; the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version, between $ 7.1 billion and $ 7.5 billion.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has closed its monthlong investigation into allegations of a 1978 baby swap at a rural hospital after finding no evidence that federal laws were broken, an agency spokesman said. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Langhorne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, couple who sought the inquiry, can ask state officials to investigate whether violations of law occurred, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said Tuesday.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Wednesday declared Democrats the winners in the two debates thus far in the presidential campaign and promised to `` make it a clean sweep'' with a win in his final showdown with Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> interrupted his preparations for the debate to toss a baseball around with an aide and, sticking to sports metaphors, described the pitches he planned throw at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during their nationally televised debate starting at 9 p.m. EDT Thursday at the <LOCATION> Pauley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pavilion </LOCATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> campus. `` A fastball, curve, slider _ maybe a knuckler,'' was the Democratic nominee's description of his planned debate repertoire. `` We're ahead 2-0, we're going to make it a clean sweep.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, sporting a <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> sweatshirt, reacted firmly to a question as to whether he thought it possible he would win the popular vote but lose to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> count, which decides the election. `` We're going to win, period,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Various polls have suggested that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is close to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the overall race but that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is further ahead in potential electoral votes. Asked how <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should handle any debate questions about running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has been highly critical of the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator, answered in a single word, `` Gingerly.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> shook hands with several people eating their lunch on the pool deck of his <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> hotel before returning to daylong meetings with aides and advisers who traveled to the debate city with him Tuesday night. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is likely to be a prime debate target for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who aides say also will try to portray <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as an insensitive and failed leader who has offered no realistic solutions to the major problems facing average Americans. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> strategists from the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and national campaigns assessed the campaign so far and what <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> still must do. `` I hope we do n't look at presidential elections as personality contests,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aide who now advises <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` We hope the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public will judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on what he says and not on how he looks,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` We think that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, the more they see of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the more thay are going to be persuaded by his view of the future.'' As for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' state campaign manager, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Podesta </PERSON>, said the Democratic ticket held a small lead in this crucial state and hoped to expand on it through televisions ads that counter what <PERSON> Podesta </PERSON> called `` some of the slime and lies the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp has been putting forth'' about the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> record on crime and the environment. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> disputed Republican assertions that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has wrapped up most of the South, West and Rocky Mountain states, but he added that while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> publicly speaks of a 50-state campaign, targeting decisions will be made in the next few days. `` Obviously we are focusing on the areas where we think we've got to win,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said `` I think you see a scenario, a very reasonable scenario, that indicates this thing is nowhere near over.'' Added <PERSON> Podesta </PERSON>: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> lock theory has about as much truth as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s television spots.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, at airport rallies Tuesday in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said he was looking forward to the confrontation. `` One of the nice things about debates is they get people out from behind the balloons and out of the flag factory and it gets them to address the issues,'' the Democratic nominee said. On the flight here, his aides promised that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be ready to exchange one-liners with the vice president. More importantly, they said, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hopes to convince voters that he cares more about them and their children than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does. To underscore that point, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will discuss his recent proposals on health care, housing and helping pay college expenses. `` This is not a pingpong match of one-liners,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign and the candidate's closest adviser. `` I think people are fed up with the meaningless labels. Who's offering the leadership?'' <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> must convince the public that, under a Democratic administration, they will get `` the benefit of the doubt when the door of the Oval Office closes.'' `` I think it's very important that the American people know his values, know what he cares about,'' <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> grape growers sued <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> over a state rule that requires restaurants to post warnings when they serve fresh foods treated with sulfite preservatives. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Table </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 1,000 growers, fear restaurants will stop serving grapes rather than post the warnings, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Obbink </PERSON>, commission president. That could cost growers and food distributors several hundred thousand dollars, <PERSON> Obbink </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kristine </PERSON> <PERSON> Gebbie </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Divison </ORGANIZATION>, said she could not comment on the lawsuit, filed the lawsuit Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> until the state attorney general's office reviewed the case She said, however, that health officials made the right decision when they ordered restaurants to warn customers when foods have been treated with sulfites. `` We've got allergic people who can react to any level -LRB- of sulfites -RRB- and the only way to protect them is to either ban all products with sulfites, or warn them that it is present,'' <PERSON> Gebbie </PERSON> said. `` As I understand it, for a very sensitive person, any level of sulfite is a problem.'' The emergency rule, which expires in February, was approved Aug. 26 by Health Division officials after they learned that restaurants were serving <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> table grapes and other items that treated with sulfites. The rule accompanies a 1985 regulation that prohibits restaurants from treating fruits, vegetables and other salad items with sulfite-based preservatives. The restriction was pushed by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> after the death of a 10-year-old girl who died after eating sulfite-treated guacamole at a restaurant. The girl's family sued the maker and distributor of the sulfite product used at the restaurant. The <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last week that the maker and distributor were not liable for damages.

<HEAD>USDA Estimates of Corn and Soybean Crops Up Slightly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This year's drought-reduced corn crop is expected to yield 4.55 billion bushels, an increase of 2 percent from last month's estimate, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The figure was still 36 percent below last year's harvest, reflecting the heat and lack of rain that cut sharply into this summer's production and still represented a five-year low. Soybean production was forecast at 1.5 billion bushels, another gain of 2 percent from September's estimate, but still 22 percent below 1987. The estimate was based on surveys made Oct. 1. A month ago, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> put the corn harvest at 4.46 billion bushels and the soybean crop at 1.47 billion bushels. Corn is the largest and most important crop grown by American farmers and as a feed is essential to the production of meat, poultry and dairy products. Soybeans, which provide high-protein meal and quality vegetable oil used in food processing, also are vital to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food production. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> forecast the cotton crop at 14.7 million bales, slightly below last year's harvest but above the Sept. 1 estimate. Wheat production was reported at 1.8 billion bushels, about the same as last month. The average yield for corn was estimated at 80.2 bushels per acre, a sharp plunge from last year's figure of 119.4 bushels per acre. `` Harvest was ahead of normal in the central and <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> states,'' the report said. `` Crop maturity and harvest continued to lag behind normal in most of the East.'' In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, influential analyst <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> estimated soybean production at 1.48 billion bushels and forecast a corn harvest of 4.55 billion bushels. His forecasts, which came out Monday, were higher than <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s September estimates But analysts said <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>'s soybean production figure was lower than expected and it sparked some buying of futures. They said his corn production forecast was higher than expected and sparked some selling of corn futures. Despite lowered production as a result of the drought, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> officials say stockpiles of corn are sufficient to prevent any shortages. They have been estimating that the drought would add one percent to the consumer price index for food this year and two percent next year. The report said the `` all crops'' production index as of Oct. 1 averaged 89 percent of the base year of 1977, up 1 percent from September. Crop production averaged 106 percent of the base last year. The record was 117 percent reached in 1985 as well as 1982 and 1981.

 The Philippine government might delay filing charges against <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> until <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities decide whether to prosecute the exiled former president, an official said Wednesday. <PERSON> Mateo </PERSON> <PERSON> Caparas </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Good Government, said President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s administration would not `` seek to obstruct justice in other lands'' or permit filing of charges here `` to be used as an excuse by Mr. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to escape his indictment abroad.'' He spoke after reports that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s legal officer recommended <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> be offered a deal to avoid prison by surrendering millions of dollars allegedly embezzled during 20 years in power. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his family live in exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The Philippine government alleges <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> ad his associates stole up to $ 10 billion before his administration was toppled in the 1986 uprising that swept Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> adviser <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> recommended the plea bargain to avoid indicting and prosecuting a former head of state. The newspaper said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials feared <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> would seek to embarrass American and Filipino authorities by disclosing improper or illegal conduct if he were indicted. The plea bargain proposal reportedly involves an investigation of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> into alleged illegal money transfers and other activities. <PERSON> Caparas </PERSON> told reporters that even if <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> accepted a plea bargain, he would still face prosecution in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Filipino officials have filed no criminal charges against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for fear he would demand his right to return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for trial. Philippine law bars criminal trials in absentia. <PERSON> Caparas </PERSON>' commission is in charge of recovering money allegedly taken by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. He told reporters that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> had asked him to issue the statement. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has repeatedly refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, citing national security. <PERSON> Caparas </PERSON> said efforts by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return were `` either an excuse to get out of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> or a part of his campaign to destabilize the present government.'' <PERSON> Caparas </PERSON> also said American <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents seized $ 6 million worth of paintings and other art objects during a raid last week on the <ORGANIZATION> Woodside </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> estate of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' son-in-law, <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Araneta </PERSON>. He said he expected the objects to be turned over to the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government because `` those paintings were purchased with the Filipino peoples' money.'' <PERSON> Araneta </PERSON> is married to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' daughter, <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Russoniello </PERSON> confirmed the raid and said agents hauled away paintings, sculptures, Ming Dynasty vases and antique furniture.

 A merchant ship carrying <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup racing yacht was released from Cuban custody and escorted into international waters Wednesday, less than a day after its seizure, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said The brief detention was `` the maritime equivalent of ` pull you over and check your license,''' said <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a spokesman for the ship's agent, <ORGANIZATION> Zapata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said the ship, <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seahorse </LOCATION>, which was seized Tuesday, is now proceeding to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The Cubans claimed it was in their territorial waters, although the shipping firm denied that. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Seahorse </LOCATION> departed from the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> port at about 12:40 p.m. EDT Wednesday and the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> harbor pilots left 20 minutes later. `` They -LRB- crew -RRB- said they were seized, the vessel was inspected and their passports were checked,'' <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON> said after the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> talked to the ship by radio. `` The Cubans claimed their vessel was nine miles offshore,'' <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> claims a 12-mile territorial limit. `` The information we have right now is that they are still going to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We have not been asked to meet them.''

 The Maronite Christian spiritual leader is making a list of up to seven candidates in hopes of getting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Syrian support for a presidential election, several <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers reported Wednesday. `` He hopes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will use its good offices to persuade <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to approve two or three of them so the election can be held,'' the independent daily <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jawdeh </PERSON>, its leading columnist, urged Patriarch <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>, the 65-year-old Maronite leader, to run for the presidency himself. `` The qualifications of the president needed to save <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> from its crisis fit only you and your friend <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Edde </PERSON>,'' he wrote. `` It's a fateful responsibility which you will have to shoulder. Otherwise there will be no <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Edde </PERSON>, 75, is a veteran politician who moved to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1976 after surviving three assassination attempts.

Twenty-nine Christian members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> have authorized <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON> to consult with Moslem factions, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> about presidential elections. By unwritten agreement among Lebanese religious groups, the president is a Christian, the prime minister Sunni Moslem and the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker a Shiite Moslem. Christians also have controlled the army and judiciary since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943. Christians were the majority in 1943, but Moslems now make up an estimated 55 percent of the 4 million people and want an equal share of power.

 Premier <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON> said Wednesday the government prefers a settlement with guerrilla field commanders to a deal with leaders who direct the Moslem insurgency from neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. In a 90-minute meeting with five Western reporters, he made no new offers that might persuadethe U.S.-supported guerrillas to stop fighting. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, appointed <ORGANIZATION> Sharq </ORGANIZATION> on May 26. The 63-year-old premier, who has close ties to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> but is not a party member, has become increasingly visible as the government spokesman. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has said he would broaden the base of his Soviet-backed government by including non-party members. Speaking to the reporters Wednesday about negotiations with the insurgents, <ORGANIZATION> Sharq </ORGANIZATION> said: `` If we are not able to have ways of negotiating with all of them, we will have negotiations with some of them. Those who are sharing the miseries of the people of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will come first.'' Moslem insurgents began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978 and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent military forces to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. Under a U.N.-mediated agreement signed last April, the Soviets are withdrawing their estimated 115,000 soldiers. The guerrillas were not a party to the agreement between <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> signed as guarantors, and conmtinued fighting. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s regime is trying to establish provincial `` coalition governments'' including representatives of the insurgents. If successful, the strategy could neutralize the guerrillas on a piecemeal basis by persuading them to stop fighting in exchange for local power. That would return <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to its pre-Soviet situation: a weak central government that survives largely through coexistence with powerful local leaders who fight to the death for their villages, valleys or hilltops but do not threaten the capital. <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON> expressed willingness to talk with Afghan leaders inside and outside the country, including deposed King <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, to establish a new government and end the war. <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> lives in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and his return as a constitutional monarch is proposed periodically proposed as means of ending the current impasse. The premier would not say whether <LOCATION> Asadabad </LOCATION>, capital of eastern <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION> province, fell to the insurgents Monday night as their leaders in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> claimed. Referring to government forces in the town 12 miles from the frontier, he said: `` Maybe they are now under control of the coalition government.'' He said he spoke by telephone Wednesday morning to the <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION> governor in <LOCATION> Asadabad </LOCATION>, who was `` trying to establish a coalition -LRB- provincial -RRB- government and he assured me of progress that he will be able to establish it.'' <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Asadabad </LOCATION>'s defenders were local militiamen paid by the government, not army troopers. He spoke in <LOCATION> Dari </LOCATION>, the Afghan language, and government officials translated his comments into English. Urging the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to stop aiding the guerrillas, he expressed the hope that elections in both countries next month would bring policy changes and `` the smell of blood of innocent people will no longer be to the liking of the leaders of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Soviet resupply of the Afghan army is not the same, according to <ORGANIZATION> Sharq </ORGANIZATION>. He said the Soviets had been providing arms to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> for 35 years, since the time of <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, who was overthrown in 1973 by his cousin and former prime minister, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>. <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> was killed in the coup five years later. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the guerrillas began in earnest when Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. More than 5 million Afghans have fled the country during the civil war and 3 million are in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, living in border towns and refugee camps that serve as guerrilla bases and supply points. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> radio said the army had killed two foreigners and 319 `` criminal extremists'' _ guerrillas _ in an attack on insurgents in <LOCATION> Zabul </LOCATION>, a southeastern province. It did not identify the foreigners, but much of the broadcast was devoted to charges of <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> involvement with the insurgency and the radio claimed Pakistani army officers were fighting alongside guerrillas inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Since his apointment, <ORGANIZATION> Sharq </ORGANIZATION> has visited <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and meets regularly with foreign reporters allowed to visit <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s photograph appears less frequently in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> newspapers and nightly television newscasts no longer are dominated by lengthy videotapes of the president's activities. <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON> served as chief of staff <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>'s government during the monarchy. `` In spite of the fact that I was the second person who waged the coup against <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON>, I have never been opposed to <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> personally, but only to the kingdom, to the monarchy,'' he said Wednesday.

 Women helped launch the nation's major social reforms of the 20th century, but now they need more political power, speakers said Wednesday as they opened a first-ever conference on women's role in the civil rights movement. <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, widow of civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said women continue to be a great moral force for social change in the civil rights movement. She said during the opening session of the conference that the next mission in the women's rights movement is to get more women elected to political office, pointing out that only 23 of 435 House seats and two of 100 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats are held by women. She added that only one of those 25 women, Rep. <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, D-Ill., is black Three women are governors. `` Human survival in the future will depend on the political empowerment of women. We women stood in the background and held things up, to keep them going, over the years,'' Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` We have a tremendous job to do each time we communicate with younger people to help them understand what the conditions were so that they can appreciate the progress that's been made and is continuing.'' <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Height </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, said a forum to address issues concerning black women is particularly necessary during the current political climate. `` It is needed today more than ever before,'' she said. About 75 participants attended the session, which was held in historic <LOCATION> Ebenezer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, and sang songs from the civil rights movement. The participants included female ministers, activists, educators and students. The conference, being held at the <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nonviolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Change </ORGANIZATION>, was convened by Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, who in 1955 refused to sit in the back of a Montgomery bus and sparked protests that grew into the civil rights movement.

<TEXT>
 A mother of three held Wednesday for robbing a bank was apparently frightened that her husband would discover she'd squandered the family's savings, police said. The 36-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> woman, whose only past scrape with the law was a speeding ticket, was arrested at her mobile home Tuesday less than two hours after robbing the <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, 25 miles north of Grand Rapids. `` The only thing I can say is she was having some financial problems, and she did not care to face her husband about it,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Osmolinski </PERSON> said. `` They had some money set aside to purchase something, and it was squandered away.'' `` I do n't believe she's your everyday criminal. I believe she deeply regrets doing this,'' he said. The woman was being held in the <LOCATION> Montcalm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> on $ 5,000 bond, the chief said. She was expected to be arraigned Thursday on armed robbery charges. Authorities said her name would be released at that court appearance. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, the bank's president, said the woman walked into the bank about 3 p.m. and handed a teller a note that read: `` I want all your money. Give me the $ 100s and $ 50s first. I have a gun.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said the teller gave the woman an undetermined amount of money but triggered a silent alarm. Police arrested the women at her mobile home after tracing a license plate number scribbled down by a witness. Money was found scattered throughout the woman's bedroom, police said. Authorities also found a pellet gun at the scene. Authorities said the woman cooperated with police and told them she was nervous during the robbery. `` She did n't think her legs were going to hold up,'' <PERSON> Osmolinski </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Norvell </PERSON>, who lives next door to the woman, was home with her family when police arrived. The suspect's children, aged 16, 14 and 13, were just returning from school, <PERSON> Norvell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Norvell </PERSON> said the woman was silent as police led her to a squad car, but said the woman's youngest daughter was crying. `` The children were kind of mystified,'' <PERSON> Osmolinski </PERSON> said, calling the robbery a spur of the moment act. `` They were wondering why. They had no idea why she would do something like this.''

<HEAD>FBI Investigation Urged in Tobacco Export Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tobacco exports wrongly certified as 100 percent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grown and shipped under government credit guarantees should come in for a full-scale <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation, a tobacco-state congressman said Wednesday. `` The harm that this corrupt blending practice has caused the American tobacco farmer is inestimable,'' Rep. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, said in a letter to Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. The credit guarantees are supposed to be reserved for American-grown crops only, although the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says it will provide them for the American-grown portion of a blended shipment if the foreign-produced portion does not exceed 25 percent of the entire package. Fourteen of 19 exporters monitored by federal investigators received government credit guarantees for entire shipments that were certified as 100 percent American tobacco but which actually blended <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and imported leaves, investigators told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agriculture subcommittee last week. The findings have agitated tobacco-state congressmen who say they are not only concerned about potential fraud but believe the credit guarantee program should be reserved for crops produced exclusively by American farmers. The case already is under investigation by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said lawmakers and officials of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's office <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON> said in his letter he was `` shocked and angered'' to learn of the wrong certification. `` By any definition this constitutes fraud.'' He said any exporters who deliberately misrepresented a shipment as being completely American `` not only stole from the taxpayers of this country but they also stole sales opportunities from our tobacco farmers.'' He asked <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to make sure that any such exporter be `` brought to justice.'' <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON> in an interview acknowledged that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> would most likely be free to call on the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> for assistance. But he said it was important to contact the attorney general to urge such action. `` I do n't know what kind of staff they have'' at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, he said. `` This thing is far more involved, complex and complicated.'' He expressed hope that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> would examine all pertinent records of exporters and banks that provided advance payments to the exporters under the guarantee program. `` And the end users, the people who supposedly purchased the tobacco,'' he said. <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON> also renewed his criticism of the way the matter has been handled by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The agency scoffed at initial reports from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that not all of the tobacco being shipped was American. FAS Administrator <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s tobacco and peanuts subcommittee last week that he had no reason to doubt the word of the exporters. He said the complaint from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was explained to him as an ill-founded rumor started by a disappointed Zimbabwean exporter. <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON> said, however, that testimony at the hearing left him unsatisfied. `` The question begs to be answered: Who's trying to cover up what?'' he said. `` I'm saying, bring in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and see if anyone else gets caught in the loop.''

<TEXT>
 Dutch, a pit bull terrier who narrowly escaped being put to death for killing another dog, was sprung from jail by someone with a love for animals and a pair of sharp wire cutters. The case involving Dutch has pitted a district court judge against a homemaker who claims Dutch should not be punished for killing a small terrier in June. Judge <PERSON> Cornelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Terwee </PERSON> ruled Tuesday that Dutch should be taken from his owner, 28-year-old <PERSON> Saskie </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Poeteren </PERSON>, and placed in a new home. But hours later, Dutch was spirited away from an <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> kennel. Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Poeteren </PERSON> said she was n't involved in the breakout but that an anonymous caller telephoned her late Tuesday assuring her Dutch was safe. `` The gentleman just said, ` Do n't worry, it'll be all right,''' Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Poeteren </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. Dutch's reprieve from death made him famous. Police ordered Dutch destroyed after he bit another dog to death. But a local magistrate ruled that biting another dog did not make Dutch a threat to the general public and ordered him returned to Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Poeteren </PERSON>. The prosecutor's office appealed. Judge <PERSON> Terwee </PERSON> ruled the fault was with Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Poeteren </PERSON>, not Dutch, because the pit bull was not on a leash at the time of the attack. She ordered Dutch placed with a new owner and fined Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Poeteren </PERSON> $ 36 for violating leash laws. Dutch television interviewed Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Poeteren </PERSON> Tuesday as she wept outside the courthouse over the confiscation order. `` He was just the cutest little thing,'' she said. `` I was sure I'd get him back.'' The broadcast showed a family snapshot of Dutch wearing his owner's sunglasses, and a close-up of Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Poeteren </PERSON>'s goldfish, apparently to illustrate her fondness for pets. Even the authoritative <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Handelsblad </ORGANIZATION> newspaper published an article on Dutch's trial under the headline, `` Judges Chewing Over Pit Bull Case.''

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses 27 Counts in McMartin Molestation Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge dismissed nearly a third of the charges in the McMartin preschool molestation trial Wednesday and prosecutors moved to drop other counts, apparently because of insufficient evidence. The 17-month prosecution case against <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON> and his mother, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, ended last week with three children failing to testify. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> immediately granted a prosecution motion to dismiss 27 counts based on their unheard allegations. Prosecutors said the youngsters had refused to appear because they were too traumatized. Deputy district attorneys <PERSON> Lael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunson </PERSON>, who sought to drop a total of 35 counts, said the judge should resolve other matters before dismissing the eight counts based on testimony of children who did appear at the trial. But defense attorney <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> accused prosecutors of attempting to `` cut their losses,'' by eliminating from the case children who told incredibly bizarre stories of alleged molestations. `` The truth of the matter is the evidence these childen presented at the preliminary hearing was unbelievable,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said outside court. Ms. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gunson </PERSON> filed a new complaint listing 52 accusations against the 30-year-old <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, and 12 charges against his 61-year-old mother, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, as well as one joint conspiracy count. They cut the number of children allegedly molested from 14 to 11, nine of whom testified at the trial. Ms. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> told reporters the remaining evidence was sufficient to convict the defendants. `` We've had testimony from nine children in this case and medical evidence which strongly supports our position that children were molested at the McMartin school,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>'s attorney, <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gits </ORGANIZATION>, said the prosecution's action was `` highly unusual,'' and said he'd never seen a similar situation before. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> called the development `` heartening,'' saying, `` Thirty five counts are out without a breath wasted by the defense.'' He added, `` It's a face-saving device. But it looks like major plastic surgery is going on ... There is a major surgical slashing of the prosecution case and it's by their own knife.'' He equated it to `` the making of a $ 35 million settlement to a $ 100 million lawsuit before the opposition has put on a case. I've never seen that before. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he would move to excise even more charges in arguments Thursday. He contends that at least four children who testified spoke of acts that allegedly occurred beyond the six-year statute of limitations for prosecution. If his argument succeeds, he said, 60 to 70 percent of the charges would be gone. <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> said he would study the law on statute of limitations overnight. The <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> case has been troubled from its inception and has gone through repeated upheavals that diminished its scope. It began in 1984 with seven defendants and originally involved claims that 41 children had been molested at the now defunct <ORGANIZATION> McMartin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pre-School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. After a two-year preliminary hearing, District Attorney <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> dismissed charges against five former teachers, saying the evidence against them was `` incredibly weak.'' The trial began in April 1987. Prosecutors called their final witnesses last week, and the defense is scheduled to begin next week. On Wednesday afternoon, <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> went to the the site of the closed preschool to see whether jurors should be taken to view the scene.

 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said Wednesday the Republicans `` refuse to stand up for the American economy'' and are avoiding issues important to keeping the nation competitive. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, stalking votes in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> on the eve of the second debate between <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, also aimed new barbs at <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of trying `` character assassination'' against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator said the Democrats had no argument with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s assertion that other nations envy the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` America is still the envy of the world,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a crowd of more than 2,500 outside the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> courthouse, many waving tiny flags, `` but not because of people like <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who refuse to stand up for the American economy.'' `` You do n't stay number one by coasting,'' he said, responding to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s assertion that the Democrats were trying to scare people about foreign ownership of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, pushed through the trade bill earlier this year. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs leaders who will stand up for the working people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said later at a rally at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>. He told the student audience that the Republicans consider higher education a privilege of wealth, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has proposed a program so all qualified students could attend college. A strong contingent of pro-Bush students in the crowd of about 3,000 heckled as he spoke. They shouted `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in ` 88'' ` and, when <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> attacked the Republicans, `` Tell the truth, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told the crowd it was a sign of how united the Democrats are that he was `` saying nice things'' about <ORGANIZATION> Razorbacks </ORGANIZATION> just before the Texas-Arkansas football game. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> alumnus received an <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> football jersey that had his name over the number `` 88.'' At rallies and in interviews Wednesday, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> worked to make sure <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> remained a live issue for for Thursday night's debate. `` Today I read in the newspaper that <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says he's going to be his own campaign manager ... his own `` Dr. Spin Control,'' he said at the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> podium. `` That may be his pitch, but I'll bet it's thrown <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a real curve ball.'' Extending the baseball metaphor, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was another example of how the vice president `` swings and misses.'' In the war against drugs: `` No runs, no hits, no progress.'' The crowd held up `` wanted'' posters with unflattering photos of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He was `` missing in the war on drugs,'' the posters said. `` And now <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. He's no JFK and he's no candidate for rookie of the year,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` At some point, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has to take some responsibility for the quality of his decisions.'' In interviews with local reporters, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> rebelled at the notion that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> might be getting sympathy because of the debate outcome. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a man who's been subjected to a virtual character assassination'' by a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign afraid to face the issues,'' he said. `` There ought to be some sympathy for <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' As for backlash from his attack on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> during the debate, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said it was `` minimal.'' If people felt sympathy for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, he said, `` That would be misplaced.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would do `` an excellent job'' in his debate Thursday night. After the first two debates, he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` were 2-0,'' he said. `` I think we'll go 3-zip,'' he predicted.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gave voice-vote approval Wednesday night to a bill authorizing a monument to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women who served in the Vietnam War. The bill, approved earlier by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, does not specify the location of the memorial to the 10,000 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women who were in the nation's longest war, other than to say it must be placed somewhere in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> metropolitan area. The measure is a substitute for earlier legislation which had proposed the addition of a nurse's statue to the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial on the grassy mall that stretches from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial. That bill had been endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in June on a 96-1 vote, but was opposed by two of the three federal agencies whose approval would have been required. Critics said the addition of another statue to the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> memorial would have violated the artistic integrity of one of the city's most popular national monuments.

<HEAD>One Killed, 124 Injured In Fire At 22-Story Building Downtown</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Workers trapped in a 22-story building hung out of windows and shouted to be rescued from flames and thick smoke Wednesday in a fire that officials said killed one person and injured 124 others. It took two hours to put out the blaze at the government-run <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> do <LOCATION> Brasil </LOCATION> building, located in the busiest intersection of downtown <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. Firefighters broke through walls of adjacent buildings to pull people to safety. Hundreds of office workers fled in panic. The fire was confined to the bottom three floors of the bank building, but enormous amounts of heavy smoke billowed from every floor, casting a haze for blocks over the congested business district. `` The fire started at the worst time: 4 p.m., near the end of the workday and just at the start of the rush hour,'' fire department Col. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Vieira </PERSON>, in charge of the rescue operation, said at the scene. `` The traffic was terrible. And because it was raining, that intensified the smoke, and we could n't see people in the windows crying for help.'' Smoke was so thick that at times it hid from view workers who hung out of windows and screamed for help. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinto </PERSON>, who was pulled from a smoke-filled room, said: `` It was terrifying. I thought the ladder would never reach me. I saw the smoke getting thicker and prayed I would get out in time.'' Col. <PERSON> Flavio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagundes </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janeiro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said about 400 people were in the 1940s-era building, when fire broke out. Construction workers had been renovating the bottom three floors of the building at the intersection of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Branco </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Presidente </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> avenues, said <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Helio </PERSON> <PERSON> Saboya </PERSON>. He said the blaze began on the first floor but the cause was still undetermined. Many workers escaped by crossing over to an adjoining building. Others climbed stairs to the roof to await rescue by police helicopters. `` About 50 of us were working on the 10th floor, when all of a sudden smoke started coming through the ventilating system,'' bank employee <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` The building safety rules tell you that in case of a fire to go down, but when we got to the fourth floor, everything was blocked because of construction work. `` We went back to the eighth floor. Somebody found a big hammer, and we smashed a hole in the wall and got through to the building next door.'' People at the scene said it took 30 minutes for the fire department to arrive. According to fire department Col. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>, 70 people were treated for smoke inhalation at local emergency centers and 55 others were sent to a hospital. Nine of the 55 were in critical condition and one died, said Dr. <PERSON> Fatima </PERSON> <PERSON> Bressan </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Souza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguiar </PERSON> hospital. On Feb. 17, 1986, fire in a downtown Rio office building killed 24 people. Three people jumped to their deaths in desperation and 21 others died from burns or asphyxiation.

 The first baseball team from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may not have defensive whizzes or offensive sluggers. But there's no question about its eagerness. The team interrupted its first sight-seeing tour of the nation's capital to watch the major-league playoffs `` They did n't want to be rude, but the older players wanted to watch the game -LRB- Game 4 between the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Spooner </PERSON>, an American who serves as the coach of the Soviet team. The opportunities this week to watch the playoffs has been a big part of the trip for a team playing a game that is only 1 -LCB- years old in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Constantly we're trying to watch,'' said <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Borodin </PERSON>, the team's coach and first baseman. `` If there's any possibility, we stay in front of the game all the time.'' The Soviet team, which hails from the <ORGANIZATION> Mendeleyev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, played the first U.S.-Soviet baseball game in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Wednesday against a <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> squad. The Soviets lost, 16-0. They committed 11 errors. They had no hits. They did have six baserunners, one on an error, five on walks, but the game was never close. The <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> team scored eight unearned runs in the first inning _ on only four hits. The results were n't much different when a team from <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> visited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> recently. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team soundly beat <PERSON> Mendeleyev </PERSON>, considered the strongest Soviet team, in all three games. The Americans also gave clinics and other instruction to their Russian counterparts. The Mendeleyevs went on to win four baseball tournaments this year, playing throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` When I was there I said they were comparable to a junior varsity high school team,'' said <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> Coach <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Babb </PERSON>. `` Now I'd say they're equivalent to a high school team. And a pretty good high school team when they put all their best people on the field.'' The defensive skills of the game have come slowest to the Soviets. `` Their fielding, hitting cutoffs, fly balls, still give them trouble,'' <PERSON> Babb </PERSON> said. `` But their hitting has improved tremendously.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would like to field a baseball team in the 1992 Summer Olympics. `` If we follow the course of our basketball players, it will take 5-7 years and we will be playing with the best teams in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bogatiryov </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't talk about the Americans.'' Still, the game against Americans was important. `` I think they're feeling the pressure of this game,'' <PERSON> Babb </PERSON> said. `` They're here trying to represent the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in our sport. They believe they must make a good showing to get the support they need back home.'' There are no baseball fields in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> played the Soviets on Russian soil, the two teams played on a soccer field with a chalk-drawn circle for a pitcher's mound. So, the <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>' facility _ a diamond with dugouts and a batting cage _ is one not to be wasted. An extra daily practice has already been squeezed into the Soviets' schedule. `` They'd like to stay out on the field all day,'' <PERSON> Spooner </PERSON> said. What do they think of the playoffs? `` They're awed,'' <PERSON> Babb </PERSON> said. `` They ask a lot of questions, ` Why -LRB- do -RRB- things happen in a game?' Having studied the game game for only a year and a half, to see the strength of these players boggles their minds.''

 Authorities said Wednesday a former volunteer firefighter is suspected of setting 16 suspicious blazes that have terrified this town since May and prompted residents to sleep in shifts and form night patrols. Plainclothes police officers hustled <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON>, 23, into the police station in neighboring <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, where he was arraigned on one felony arson charge stemming from a fire at his brother's cabin Bail was set at $ 50,000. State Safety Commissioner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said the state will seek indictments against <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON>, charging him with setting 15 other fires. Five of the 21 suspicious fires apparently were set by others, said state Police Lt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloper </PERSON>, who declined to give details, including how many suspects there are and whether any of the suspects acted in concert. <PERSON> Sloper </PERSON> also declined to say whether authorities believe <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> acted alone in the 16 fires. `` We do anticipate further arrests,'' <PERSON> Sloper </PERSON> said of the five fires. The weekly <ORGANIZATION> Coos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> had been taken Tuesday to the <LOCATION> Twin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> police barracks in neighboring <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>. `` He is upset,'' the brother told the paper. `` There's a definite mental strain; there's no doubt about that.'' <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, a quiet hamlet of 850 people, has had 21 suspicious or confirmed arson fires since a May 5 grass fire. A barn was the next target, then empty homes and later occupied ones. Most of the fires were set late at night, many at the back of buildings. No one has been killed or seriously hurt, although some people barely escaped and lost their homes. Despite the arrest, many residents said they were still fearful. Most still refused to give their names for fear of retribution. One woman said she would not rest easy until every fire is explained and every arsonist convicted. `` Until then, I leave my light on and I'm going to stay up with a gun,'' she said. As the toll of scorched structures mounted, many families began sleeping in shifts and abandoned vacation plans. Some residents began night patrols. Police feared vigilante violence. `` I have a feeling we're developing the same callus you develop in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, a state senator and <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> resident, said last week. `` If a car bomb is going to blow up in front of your house, it's going to happen. You're scared, but you have to live with it.'' <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> once worked for the town's volunteer fire department but was asked to quit when he moved to nearby <LOCATION> Groveton </LOCATION>. He has since moved back to <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION>, where he works nights as a dishwasher at a restaurant. <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> has been staying at the <LOCATION> Skywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION> motel in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> since August. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, who has lived at the motel since his home burned in May, said he doubts <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> is involved. `` I think they've got the wrong fish in a cage,'' <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said. A co-worker also defended <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> on Wednesday. `` A couple of times there's been fires and he's been right here in the room across from me,'' said the man, who did not want his name used. <PERSON> Sloper </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> had been a suspect for some time. `` It's taken a great deal of time and effort to ... make sure -LRB- we had -RRB- more than a reasonable amount of evidence to present,'' he said. The fire for which <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> was charged occurred Aug. 23 at his brother <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s cabin. It was the 19th suspicious blaze to break out. <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> reported the fire and was trying to extinguish it when firefighters arrived. He was questioned for eight hours afterward and police searched his home and car. In an interview two days later, <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> told the Democrat: `` All I tried to do was save my brother's house and this is the thanks I get.'' <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON>, who had been followed constantly by police, again denied any involvement in the fires in a Democrat interview last month.

Maariv, an independent daily newspaper, said the new Israeli trading company was called <PERSON> Copeco </PERSON> and 20 possible projects were under study. A government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they focused on agriculture, medicine and medical technology. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio described the two companies as `` virtual chambers of commerce or interest sections.''

 Workers scrambled Wednesday to transform <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>'s basketball arena into a television studio where the debate between <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could help decide the Election Day choices of millions of voters. Debate organizers trucked in sets, lecterns and equipment straight from the Oct. 5 vice presidential debate in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. They said things were going smoothly despite the time crunch. As the Republican and Democratic nominees spent a quiet day preparing for their second and final debate, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Fouhy </PERSON>, executive producer for the bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Presidential Debates, said the frenzy was `` intense'' inside the <LOCATION> Pauley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pavilion </LOCATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> campus. <PERSON> Fouhy </PERSON> said his job was made easier because this university of 34,000 students is accustomed to handling big events. `` They have a whole special events staff that's used to doing these things,'' he said. `` We plugged into that.'' <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> served as the athletes' housing center and site of the gymnastics competition for the 1984 Olympic Games, and last year entertained <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s visiting Prince <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> and the Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Vice Chancellor <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> said the debate was `` a pretty big deal'' but nothing the university ca n't handle. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> campus in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was selected last Friday after the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> withdrew as debate sponsor in a dispute with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigns. The debates commission, established by both campaigns to handle the first presidential debate in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, on Sept. 25, quickly succeeded the league as sponsor of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> event. <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the league's original debate site, the old Shrine Auditorium near downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was vetoed when the league demanded reimbursement of $ 90,000. She said <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> offered free use of its 13,000-seat basketball arena. And on Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted 11-2 to give $ 25,000 to help fund the presidential debate. `` I would have supported it if it was open to the public,'' said Councilman <PERSON> Ernani </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON>, who dissented because only 1,500 people will be allowed in the 12,500-seat arena and the audience of chosen Republicans and Democrats would be waiting to cheer their candidate's `` hot shot statements.'' At the sprawling <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> campus, the floor of the arena was being covered and carpeted Wednesday and partitioned off from the rows of bleachers that will go unused during the debate. Organizers said 2,000 tickets will be distributed for the debate audience in keeping with the intimate, TV studio atmosphere that characterized the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> debate and the Oct. 5 vice presidential matchup in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. The red-carpeted stage, the deep blue backdrop and oak lecterns that were used in the previous debates were installed in the arena. A press center was set up in the nearby student union building for an estimated 3,000 journalists and crews covering the event. The debate format also will be the same. Each candidate will have two minutes to answer a question and one minute for rebuttal, with brief closing statements. The panelists will be moderator <ORGANIZATION> Bernard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Compton </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of Newsweek magazine. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to contribute funds to defray debate costs, which she said probably would be substantially more than the $ 500,000 required for the last debate. Raising private money for the debate has `` been a hustle,'' she said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is expected to take up compromise legislation Thursday to require banks, retail stores and other issuers of credit cards to provide more information to consumers about interest rates and other charges. The measure, which still falls short of the disclosure requirements sought by some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and consumer groups, likely will be sent to the White House by the end of the week. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed it late Tuesday. Senate-House negotiators met last week to iron out the differences between separate bills passed earlier by their respective chambers. Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking consumer affairs subcommittee, walked out of that session because, he said, Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the full <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, would not permit him to air complaints about the measure before the conferees `` This bill does not help the consumer,'' said <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gainer </PERSON>, an official of the Ralph Nader-organized <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, agreed somewhat with <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, saying the legislation fails to go far enough with the new disclosure rules and pre-empts states from passing stronger laws. Said Ms. Gainer: `` Unfortunately, congressional banking conferees crafted a bill which will wipe out existing state law, prohibit states from acting in the future and allow the credit-card industry to operate under a single new federal law.'' The bill requires disclosure of annual fees, the interest rate charged for unpaid balances, the method for calculating that balance and the length of grace periods during which no interest is charged. Similarly, late fees, over-the-limit fees, and fees for cash advances must be disclosed. It requires that information to be provided in all direct-mail solicitations for applicants. In other cases, however, some of the information need not be provided until the consumer already has been provided a card. Ms. <PERSON> Gainer </PERSON> and others argue the disclosures should be up-front in all cases. Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., noted during the final <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate Tuesday night that `` The initial motivation for this legislation came from the high costs consumers are paying to use their credit cards While most interest rates were declining by about 50 percent during the early 1980s, credit card interest rates not only did n't fall, they rose.'' With nearly 106 million Americans holding 800 million credit cards, <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said, the impact of even small changes in rates and fees can be vast. `` Even a 1 percent decline in interest rates would save consumers about $ 700 million,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents approximately 800 federally insured banks, savings and loans and credit unions, endorsed the legislation. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Belew </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBA </ORGANIZATION> president, said the measure `` provides for simple,; meaningful disclosures which ensure that consumers can compare terms on credit cards. Its enactment will show that consumer and industry representatives can work together to produce legislation which benefits the public.'' Ms. <PERSON> Gainer </PERSON> acknowledged that the bill `` does provide significant assistance to consumers in states that have not yet passed disclosure laws. In fact, now, most state laws are not as comprehensive in certain areas as the federal bill is.'' But she noted that the states would be precluded from enacting tougher disclosure requirements, including the length that rate and fee terms remain available to prospective applicants, whether the issuer reserves the right to change the terms after the contract has been signed, and whether an out-of-state issuer is complying with the state's interest rate ceiling.

 Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, saying he had reached a `` snapping point'' over control of his campaign by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides, declared Wednesday that from now on `` I am my own handler.'' `` I'm going to have fun, and I'm going to say what's on my mind,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters as he left <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> en route to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> for a fund-raiser and speech. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator said he was `` not mad at anybody in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign.'' However, he had previously expressed irritation at published reports quoting unidentified aides to <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as calling him a liability for the ticket. Over the weekend, he complained to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also has chafed at the rigid format dictated by the `` handlers'' from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, limiting his access to the press, scripting prepared texts for him to read and even determining when he would wave as he got off his campaign plane. He told reporters `` that's all been thrown away.'' Aides said the decision to publicly assert control of more aspects of his campaign was <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s alone and was not yet another new script handed down from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> officials. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s aides, many of them <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> intimates, were openly delighted that the story was dominating <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s campaign day. Beyond his speaking out, it was unclear what changes might be seen in <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s campaign. His schedule is still determined by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strategists, and even <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he would continue to deliver the speeches prepared for him. Those are cleared, at least in early draft form, by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. `` There'll be some off-the-cuff -LRB- remarks -RRB-, but there'll be some scripted. I've learned that there is a certain value in having a script,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He said he will still coordinate with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> officials and `` stay in close communication with them.'' `` They're going to suggest things that I say, suggest things that I do, and I'm going to take that under consideration,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that as one who has successfully run for elective office in the past, `` I know how to get votes and I know what's best for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I've done it their way this far and now it's my turn,'' he added. He said he has cordial relations with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the campaign chairman. The two men spoke at length on Tuesday night. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Wednesday in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>: `` These things are really very regrettable and I certainly understand why he would be steamed up about them. If I could find out who was putting them out, we'd have fewer people working in the campaign He said `` we're going to make a little effort'' to find out who on the staff was talking to the media. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had told a senior staff meeting last Friday `` at the vice president's recommendation'' that any member of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign staff who criticized <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> faced possible dismissal. The matter had come to a head last Friday, two days after the vice presidential debate, when anonymous <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides were quoted as saying <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had not done well in the debate and was a liability to the ticket. `` I think there is a snapping point that everyone goes through and it snapped about Friday sometime, last Friday,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. This week <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> started telling reporters, `` I do n't anybody to say well, here's what some campaign aide said about it. You ask me and I'll give you the answer.'' Although <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been more accessible to reporters since the debate, he has still not held a formal news conference since Sept. 15. He said he will try to have one soon.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> on Wednesday unveiled a plan aimed mainly at stopping massive, uncontrolled burning in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle by farmers and ranchers which has aggravated the worldwide `` greenhouse effect.'' The program, called `` Our Nature,'' calls for a temporary end to government tax and financing benefits for large-scale cattle ranching in the northern <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> and a ban on exports of unprocessed tropical timber. Environmentalists have charged that the clearing of vast <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> tracts by the primitive slash-and-burn method has released hundreds of tons of noxious gases into the atmosphere. They say this causes the greenhouse effect, the gradual warming of the Earth's atmosphere by a concentration of pollutants that act like a blanket, trapping the sun's warmth. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s government-run <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said about 77,000 square miles of land were cleared by the slash-and-burn method in 1987 and forecast a similar amount for this year. `` We must create nationwide consciousness that we are all passengers in the adventure of Man on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> said in a ceremony announcing the program. `` The era of unlimited natural resources is over.'' The `` Our Nature'' program also contains a recommendation to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cut mercury imports. Free-lance gold prospectors throughout the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> use the highly toxic element to separate gold from river silt and then throw the waste into the water. `` This program is going to shake up powerful economic interests,'' said <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Guimaraes </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s federal <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` But the government is resolved to carry it out.'' Earlier laws designed to colonize and develop the poor <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, which covers an area equal to roughly two-thirds of the 48 continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, permitted land developers to burn off 50 percent of their properties _ the fastest and cheapest way to open up clear areas _ and then gave them tax deductions for doing so. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that since 1978 this type of land-clearing in the <LOCATION> Brazilan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> has destroyed 240,000 square miles of natural tropical rainforest cover _ an area larger than <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Interior Minister <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Alves </PERSON> said the tax break suspensions were temporary, because the government is working out a plan to determine which parts of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> can be used for farming and ranching and which must be left alone. Even before `` Our Nature'' was announced, private <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> developers complained about the plan. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariutti </PERSON>, who has three projects on a total of 136,000 acres in the western state of <LOCATION> Mato </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grosso </LOCATION>, told the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Folha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION> that `` Cutting tax incentives will hold back development of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>.'' Large developers in the region, he said, `` generally preserve more than the 50 percent of the land required by law.''

 Former Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said Wednesday he declined an invitation to be interviewed for president of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, a decision that disappointed his top backer for the post, Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>. `` I've told the selection committee that I will not be a candidate,'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said. `` You know, I love our university, what it's meant to me and to so many of us ... but I just could not persuade myself that this was the best role I could play. It's a different world, you know, administering an academic community, and it just did n't seem the right thing for me to do.'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, a lawyer, had not expressed interest in the job publicly, but <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> had promoted him as the successor to <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, who resigned as the university's president last March. <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said by telephone from his home in <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> that he was disappointed by <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s decision but added, `` life goes on.'' <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said he did n't try to persuade <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> to reconsider after <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> told him of his decision Tuesday. `` You have to really want that; it's a difficult job,'' <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said. The governor said persuading lawmakers to approve his budget requests for the university would have been much easier with <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> at the helm. `` I was a little bit selfish,'' <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said. `` I wanted someone to help carry that burden, and he would have done it and I think very successfully.'' The university's credibility has been damaged by turmoil over spending on the university president's residence and office, which led to <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>'s resignation, and other problems during the year. <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> who returned to the state to practice law following his unsuccessful 1984 Democratic presidential bid, said he has no current plans to run for political office in the future.

 A dispute between scientists has left 200 rare and pampered rats without a hole to call their own. Carefully bred for up to 125 generations by <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION>, the rats represent rare genetic strains. Some are masters at racing through rat mazes, while others were bred with various personalities, or are drunks or drug addicts. The rats have bounced between <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> since they were evicted last month from <ORGANIZATION> Lafayette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, a state mental health facility, The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. `` I'm not sure what is going on,'' said <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, a psychiatry professor. `` I have devoted my career to the rats. They are the product of from 75 to 125 generations of precise breeding and considerable study. But I suppose if we do n't resolve it, this will bring it to an end.'' For years, the rats were bred in <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>'s lab in <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. But in March 1986, a lab fire wiped out half his 1,800 rats. The lab was closed. <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> took some of the luckless rodents home with him, and sent others to laboratories around the world. In January 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Lafayette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> hired <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> on condition that he bring along at least 100 of his special rats. He brought 200, and the rats enjoyed a warm welcome. But they fell out of favor when <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> was dismissed after spending a month at overseas medical conventions. Clinic officials contend <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> had no research plans for the rats. `` He was parading around <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, completing ignoring these rats,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenzweig </PERSON>, acting chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s psychiatry department. The <ORGANIZATION> Lafayette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> is run by the state but staffed by psychiatry professors from <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> State </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> denies neglecting his rats. He maintains that his troubles stem from rejecting a <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> colleague's request to receive credit on any research material published by <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>. After dismissing <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, the clinic tried to send his rats packing as well. But when the rodents arrived in <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> refused to accept them. The rodents spent part of last week in a shipping office until the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, offered the rats temporary shelter. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> State </PERSON> officials said they felt sorry for the rats, and sent a truck on Saturday to pick them up. The rats are now in an animal research facility while school officials ponder their fate.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has become `` the party of working people'' as he carried his campaign for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into the battleground states of the industrial Northeast Wednesday. `` The party that so many of us grew up with still exists, except today it's called the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, and I'm asking all of you to come home and join me,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said at a Columbus Day dinner here. Earlier, the president told students and teachers at <ORGANIZATION> Upper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Darby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the suburbs of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> that he is concerned about young people's future and `` the decisions we Americans make at the polls this year will determine whether or not that future will be bright.'' The president mingled public speeches with private <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> fund-raising sessions, meeting with 70 people who paid $ 5,000 apiece for a reception at a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> restaurant and attending a similar function at an airport hotel after arriving in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> on his way to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, he also met with Archbishop <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON>, head of the city's 1.3 million Roman Catholics, and with the family of a policeman gunned down in the line of duty. In his West Orange speech, he reminded the audience that in his earlier years he was a Democrat, and `` it is often said that the once-proud Democratic party of FDR and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> is dead and gone, that the Democratic party has been taken over by the left, that the departure from the mainstream that we began to see at their 1968 convention now defines the party at the national level, especially the liberal leadership in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` But there is something you should know,'' he added. `` The party of FDR and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> could n't be killed. `` You see, the secret is that when the left took over the Democratic party, we took over the Republican party. We made the Republican party into the party of working people, the family, the neighborhood, the defense of freedom, and, yes, the American flag and the Pledge of Allegiance to ` one nation under God.''' The menu for the $ 20-a-plate Columbus Day dinner was salad, ziti, meatballs, sausage, dessert and coffee. The affair was co-sponsored by Italian Americans of <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and the Italian <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, a Newark-based weekly newspaper. When he left the archbishop's home in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with the family of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON>, a policeman who was killed Sept. 30 in <LOCATION> Bryn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mawr </LOCATION> while investigating a burglary. His trip Wednesday took him to two hotly contested Northeastern states where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are slugging it out for a combined total of 41 electoral votes. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials said that as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was en route to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One and a commuter plane may have flown too close to one another, but the president was in no danger.

The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the incident, he said. Telling the <PERSON> Upper </PERSON> <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> students that `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s prosperity is both an opportunity and a challenge,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` I am dedicating myself this year to making sure that this future of hope built on opportunity and traditional values remains open to each of you. I believe that the decisions we Americans make at the polls this year will determine whether or not that future will be bright.'' Besides praising <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recognized the vice president's controversial running mate, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, by quoting his comment in last week's vice presidential debate that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is `` the envy of the world. The president also reminded the students that `` when you vote for a candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, you're voting for the direction of the country and the world as much as when you vote for president.'' `` In the last eight years we have set our sights once again on the enduring values of family, faith, neighborhood, opportunity, and freedom,'' the president said. `` I believe prosperity and economic growth are the products of strong values,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bishop in Besieged Town: Pray For Peace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Troops and rebels are fighting house-to-house in the besieged southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION> and a Roman Catholic bishop there sent a plea: `` We implore you to pray for peace,'' a newspaper reported Wednesday. The English-language newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> did not say how it received the written plea from Archbishop <PERSON> Paride </PERSON> <PERSON> Taban </PERSON>. It published the appeal Wednesday. The army meanwhile confirmed reports by the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> that the rebels had captured <PERSON> Ikotos </PERSON>, a town near <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION> It said soldiers made a `` tactical withdrawal'' from the town, 45 miles north of <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>. The army claimed its 108-man garrison inflicted many casualties among more than 3,000 rebels attacking from east, west and north but gave no figures for either side. The rebels said Friday that 62 soldiers died in the three-day battle and that 300 fled into <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>. The fall of <PERSON> Ikotos </PERSON> gives the rebels control over three towns that form a triangle around <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Equatoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, 85 miles east of <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>, the largest city in the south. <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> fighters captured <PERSON> Kialla </PERSON> and <PERSON> Katire </PERSON> weeks ago. The <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said street fighting was reported this week in <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION> and that the archbishop has been sending appeals for food and other relief supplies for the besieged populace. `` This is my last message to you,'' <PERSON> Taban </PERSON>'s message read, according to the newspaper. `` We implore you to pray for peace.'' He said Catholic agencies in his diocese have nothing else to offer <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION>'s thousands of hungry people, but the town has given up on expecting help from the outside, the newspaper reported. It quoted the archbishop as saying he told his parishioners `` everybody should decide for himself'' what he should do, and `` we can not do more than pray for the will of God for you.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> began its rebellion in 1983 in an effort to win autonomy for the south and now controls 90 percent of the southern countryside and an increasing number of villages and towns. Despite heavy rains in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> this year, many areas remain plagued by famine because fighting has forced farmers from their land. Relief operations are hampered because rebels control checkpoints on many roads, railways and the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and threatened to shoot at planes flying in the area without rebel permission. Two civilian planes were shot down in 1986-87 with a loss of more than 70 lives. A relief plane carrying about 100 people was hit last month as it landed at <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>.

 American and Soviet officials have agreed to set up a disinformation `` hotline'' to prevent accusations against each other's countries from escalating into worldwide propaganda campaigns, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. `` Agreement to work toward the establishment of an ` early warning system''' to challenge disinformation was among the results of U.S.-Soviet information talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Sept. 26-28, said <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> gave few details of the proposed system in a National Press Club speech but later used the term `` hotline,'' suggesting it would be a telecommunications link patterned after the 25-year-old Moscow-Washington `` hotline'' intended to prevent accidental triggering of a superpower nuclear war. The `` early warning system'' would be `` designed to give the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a mechanism to challenge disinformation efforts before they become part of a worldwide campaign,'' <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> said. The Russians have `` curtailed dramatically'' circulation of disinformation, and extreme, false or unsubstantiated charges against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since last December's summit between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>. But exceptions continue, he added, recalling an official <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> broadcast he heard a few days ago about `` Western countries buying children from impoverished <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries and treating them as slaves.'' `` I could n't believe my ears ... we are going to try the hotline on that one,'' he said. <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his supporters `` recognize this kind of disinformation which was part of the war of ideas a very short time ago is counterproductive.'' Soviet agreement for the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> to open a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> bureau was announced after the September talks. <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> said other agreements concluded in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> included commercial distribution of Soviet and American films within the two countries, sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> newsmagazines for Soviet currency provided expanded circulation is achieved, cooperation in publishing and printing and an annual exchange of 1,000 high school students from each country. The two countries also agreed to start talks in January on setting up cultural centers in each other's territory, <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> said, terming the agreements `` important first steps in establishing a freer flow of information and a more constructive relationship.''

 The best place to live in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in terms of psychological well-being, is <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; the worst is <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, according to a researcher writing in Psychology Today magazine. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, a psychologist at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, ranked 286 metropolitan areas based on rates of crime, suicide, alcoholism and divorce rates. His findings were published in the magazine's November issue. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said he was surprised that `` the West and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, known for their mild climates and easy living ranked highest and second highest respectively on all four types of pathology.'' He said the 25 best places were: <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>; St. Cloud, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> McAllen-Pharr-Edinburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Altoona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; Provo-Orem, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Utica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Sheboygen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; Paterson-Clifton-Passaic, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Lafayette-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Poughkeepsie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Albany-Schenectady-Troy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford-Fall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.; Bloomington-Normal, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; Wheeling, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Wausau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis </LOCATION> The 25 worst were: Reno; <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Lakeland-Winter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock-Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, Ark.; <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach-Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale-Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; Tampa-St. <PERSON> Petersburg-Clearwater </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Riverside-San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said he decided to develop his own system of rating cities after a study by a geographer in 1984 found <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> the `` worst city in This time <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> ranked 232 out of 286. The weakness of previous studies was that they `` assume that people who live under better environmental, economic and cultural conditions are more satisfied with their lives.'' Psychologists, he added, though, `` have long recognized that favorable living conditions do n't always produce subjective well-being.'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> and fellow researchers <PERSON> Kuni </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyake </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> settled on rates of alcoholism, suicide, divorce and crime as the yardsticks to measure by `` because they are both causes and effects of social stress, clearly an important element in psychological well-being,'' he said. A comparison of the new study with past rankings of the best places to live found `` virtually no correlation,'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said. `` The sharp differences between our rankings and the others indicate that the objective environmental, economic and cultural conditions they use as guidelines do n't relate very well on pathology,'' he said. `` When we compared their rankings with the alcoholism, suicide, divorce and crime rates in each city, the correlations were very weak.'' He said the researchers were surprised to learn that higher suicide and crime rates were associated with milder climates and healthier economic conditions. `` We know that moving to a new area often appeals to people who are having trouble in their lives and think that a fresh start somewhere may help them. So they move to a place where conditions are most attractive, bringing their pathology with them and driving up the rates of divorce, suicide, alcoholism and crime in these areas,'' he said. Also, sociologists have found that areas where there are many migrants suffer from social disorganization as the new arrivals struggle to cope with new situations, new stresses and new social norms, he said. `` We found that the higher migration rates of the Sun Belt areas of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and West went with correspondingly higher rates of alcoholism, suicide, divorce and crime, whether we compared cities or regions,'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Britain and Vietnam Agree To Repatriate Hong Kong Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> agreed Wednesday to repatriate Vietnamese refugees who want to return home from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, with financial assistance from the British government if needed. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said about 350 Vietnamese boat people who expressed a desire to return home will be sent back in a phased program that will start immediately. The agreement was announced at the end of a second round of talks between a joint <LOCATION> British-Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> delegation and a Vietnamese delegation led by the assistant foreign minister, Vu Khoan. The accord says both sides accept `` the need for comprehensive arrangements'' for Vietnamese boat people who arrived in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> after June 16, when the British colony moved to curb a steep rise in refugees by ending its open door policy. A Foreign Office spokesman, who by custom was not identified, said the 9,500 Vietnamese refugees in question are classified as illegal immigrants and will remain in detention centers pending outcome of further talks with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Forcible repatriation of refugees who do not want to return home has not been discussed with the Vietnamese, he said, adding: `` We will concentrate on the first 350. We hope others will come forward and realize that their future is in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' Vu said the returning refugees would be received in a `` humanitarian way.'' Under <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> policy now in effect, Vietnamese who can not prove they are fleeing political persecution are labeled illegal immigrants subject to repatriation. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> holds that most are actually economic migrants. The total number of Vietnamese boat people now in camps there is 25,000. Two weeks ago, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> began broadcasts aiming at <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> explaining the new tough policy in a move to discourage Vietnamese from heading there. The delegations also called on other countries to increase their efforts to accept Vietnamese eligible for resettlement from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. They invited the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugees </ORGANIZATION> to take part in putting into effect the accord to repatriate those Vietnamese who want to return home.

<TEXT>
 A bipartisan group of senators working on the $ 2.6 billion election-year drug bill agreed late Wednesday on a formula for paring down the more than 100 amendments to the catchall measure. Under the procedure, about 56 of the amendments would either be folded into the bill, offered as amendments or killed by the chamber's leaders. The remaining amendments would not be offered at all. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would vote Thursday on whether to follow the proposed formula and begin debating the <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said that if lawmakers agreed to follow the procedure, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could complete work on the bill by Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> leaders have been hoping that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could adjourn for the year by Friday. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said that if the procedure for considering the amendments was not adopted, `` It may mean we'll have no drug bill.'' The majority leader said the drug bill would be amended to include provisions giving prosecutors tougher powers to crack down on child pornography, creating a new position of federal `` drug czar,'' and stiffening sentences for some drug offenses. The agreement would allow votes on about eight other amendments, including language stripping a provision establishing the death penalty for certain drug offenders who commit murder, requiring states to randomly test new drivers license applicants, and allowing some drug offenders to lose federal benefits they might receive. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> took to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor Wednesday morning to urge his colleagues to refrain from offering amendments `` trying to indicate who can be the toughest, who can be the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> in the drug war. `` We can all be tough, but we've got a good tough bill,'' he said. But some lawmakers were holding out for guarantees that votes would be allowed on their own amendments. Included among them were Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, who was insisting on votes on proposals to toughen sentences for drug offenders convicted of dealing with children, and to deny many federal benefits to some people found guilty of drug sales. `` I'm going to offer those two amendments if I'm here and alive,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said before entering one of the day's negotiating sessions. The focus of much of Wednesday's discussion was an amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, to limit appeals by convicted criminals who claim procedural errors in their trials. By late Wednesday, lawmakers thought a compromise might involve delaying a final decision until after a commission appointed by <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> presents its findings next year. Another controversial proposal, also advanced by <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, would allow some illegally obtained evidence seized in good faith by police officers to be admitted in court. Lawmakers said a possible compromise would involve writing into law the language from a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that allowed the use of evidence seized by police armed with a defective court warrant. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> came to the Capitol to urge <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans to seek a bill resembling a tough version passed last month by the House. That legislation included the death penalty and many other provisions stiffening penalties and increasing the anti-drug powers of the authorities. Lawmakers also had to decide how to deal with other amendments that have nothing to do with illicit drugs. These proposals, written by senators realizing that the drug bill could be the last one to pass <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year, included language requiring warning labels on alcoholic beverage containers and imposing sanctions on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. One thing the legislation lacked was a way to pay for itself. Lawmakers say $ 1.4 billion of the bill's pricetag would be spent in 1989, but concede that the government can currently only scrape together no more than $ 450 million to pay for it. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has so far voted down efforts to raise taxes or slash other spending to provide the money. Even if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should approve a bill, <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators would have to agree to an identical version of the legislation before it could be sent to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for his signature.

 Indian demonstrators who say the discovery of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> led only to slavery and impoverishment broke up a Columbus Day celebration Wednesday, and 12 people were reported injured in the resulting street brawl. `` Long live Cuauhtemoc!'' demonstrators shouted, referring to the last Aztec emperor of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, who battled in vain against the Spanish Conquest. `` Death to Columbus!'' The Excelsior news service said several women, one police officer and a boy were among those hurt in a brawl between demonstrators and ceremony organizers. No arrests were reported during the ceremony to honor <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Columbus </PERSON>, who came upon the New World on Oct. 12, 1492 while in search of the Orient. The demonstrators were led by a group calling itself the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples and included residents of <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Seminario </PERSON>, an area in south <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> taken over by squatters in recent years. Some threw sticks and rocks at ceremony organizers. Several gardeners working nearby joined in and began throwing clods of dirt. The demonstrators ripped down flower arrangements in front of a statue of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> and interrupted singing of the Mexican national anthem and Columbus Day speeches during the short-lived ceremony attended by about 300 people. Another Indian group, the Center of Pre-American Culture, demonstrated peacefully on Tuesday in the Zocalo, a downtown plaza. The coalition of 52 organizations held a celebration of Indian dances, music, art and poetry in asking for abolition of Columbus Day as a holiday. Excelsior quoted Center president <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> as saying Tuesday that <PERSON> Columbus </PERSON>' arrival `` began the enslavement, the destruction of our ancient cultures and the stealing of our riches, something that has n't stopped in 500 years.'' `` What the whites want to believe is that Indian children are n't born in our country anymore,'' <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> said

 A federal judge and lawyers began the tedious process on Wednesday of whittling down a list of more than 100 prospective jurors for the trial of two Teamsters officials on racketeering and embezzlement charges. The process of finding a panel of 12 will last at least through Friday and possibly into next week. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, 66, is charged with two counts of labor racketeering, two of embezzlement and two of making false statements to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Prosecutors contend the alleged $ 700,000 embezzlement scheme was masterminded by the late <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> is president of the 5,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 507 </ORGANIZATION>, an international vice president of the union since 1983, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> and president of <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> 41 in northeast <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. He also is president of Bakery Workers Local 19 in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. Co-defendant <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, 52, Local 507's recording secretary, is charged with two counts of labor racketeering and one count of embezzlement. Until recently, both <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> were overshadowed by the defense of <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> president from 1983 until he died of brain cancer on July 9. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> also was indicted on charges of labor racketeering and embezzlement. Questionnaires were handed out to some 125 prospective jurors on Oct. 3 to save lawyers time in the interrogation process. District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> presided over the start of jury selection. About 25 possible jurors indicated the expected length of the trial, from six to eight weeks, would cause them personal problems and most were dismissed. Another three were dismissed after claiming to know one of the defendants. With 86 possible jurors then packing the courtroom, <PERSON> White </PERSON> asked if any of them would be unable to ignore pre-trial publicity surrounding the case. None responded. Federal prosecutors have alleged <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, as secretary-treasurer of Local 507, masterminded the alleged $ 700,000 embezzlement scheme. The trial culminates a federal probe that came to light on Oct. 8, 1982, when federal marshals and agents of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's office seized records at Local 507. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> hopes to prove that <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> helped place on the payroll of Local 507 three people who received money but did no union work and benefitted personally by doing so. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> have been identified in pre-trial documents as <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informants who would provide their <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> `` handlers'' with information about organized crime and Teamsters inner-politics. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> apparently had no such <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> link, and court documents are unclear whether he knew anything about the others' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> connection.

 Real estate mogul <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> announced Wednesday he has agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' profitable Northeast air shuttle for $ 365 million in cash and will rename it after himself. `` I want to run it as a diamond, an absolute diamond,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> proclaimed to reporters at a news conference with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> at the Plaza Hotel in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, another recent Trump acquisition He said the three-city service would be renamed `` The Trump Shuttle'' and its blue-silver <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s would be redecorated and emblazoned with red, black and gold stripes. The deal is expected to be completed by mid-December, if it survives government scrutiny and a legal attack by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions, who said the sale would be the death of the airline and vowed a fight to overturn the deal The announcement followed a week of speculation about the billionaire developer's interest in buying the shuttle from ailing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which is a major subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. The price was well above previous estimates of what <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> would pay. `` It's top dollar,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON>, an airline analyst for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Many analysts and other observers had estimated that the shuttle _ which serves <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and is the most profitable of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s operations _ could fetch $ 200 million to $ 300 million. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> had tried earlier this year to transfer the shuttle operation from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to a new subsidiary for $ 225 million, but <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> unions blocked that attempt. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in announcing that it was keeping a close eye on Eastern in the wake of the shuttle sale, said $ 365 million was `` a generous price.'' The interest on that sum could recover more than half the cash flow that would be lost by selling the shuttle, the credit-rating agency said. For the image-conscious <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, the purchase could be viewed more as a way to enhance his prestige and influence than a straight business deal. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> bought the legendary Plaza Hotel for $ 400 million following a heated battle with other suitors. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has admitted that he was `` in love'' with the hotel for more than a decade and `` tore himself up'' to get it. But there also could be compelling business logic behind <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s latest acquisition Many analysts said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> might use the shuttle to help draw people to his hotel and casino properties in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, on the weekends. `` It's something that we're looking at,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> now operates a helicopter service from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The resort city's <LOCATION> Bader </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> is too small to handle the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s operated by the shuttle, but the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> 10 miles from the city can accommodate them. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> noted a report that he intended to sell the land earmarked for a huge commercial development in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to help finance the shuttle deal, but he did not directly address its accuracy. No interested party could afford to pay him what the 100-acre site is worth, he joked to reporters. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said the shuttle would maintain fares competitive with the shuttle service of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and would not lay off any employees. The $ 365 million includes landing rights at airports in the three shuttle cities plus 17 planes. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said it welcomed <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> into the shuttle market. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> claims its share of that market has jumped from around 24 percent in October 1986 to roughly 45 percent. Eastern said the airline's shuttle service had net income of around $ 16.8 million in 1987 on revenue of $ 40.3 million, down from a 1985 profit of $ 28.2 million on revenue of $ 49.2 million, according to spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> has not disclosed earnings from its shuttle operations. The shuttle deal marks another tumultuous chapter in the saga of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, the Miami-based carrier that has been scarred by management-labor feuding and $ 1 billion in losses over the past decade.

 A deaf former church janitor pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges of kidnapping and molesting two girls, keeping one in a dirt crawl space under the church's altar for as long as six weeks. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, 32, entered the plea to two counts of kidnapping, one count of attempted kidnapping and seven counts of child molestation, said prosecutor <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> uses sign language and head nods to speak through an interpreter. Prosecutors filed an amended complaint that dropped another molestation charge, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. `` He freely admitted molesting both children but would not admit to one particular molest on -LRB- one of the girls -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said, explaining why prosecutors decided to drop one count. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> was accused of kidnapping 4-year-old <PERSON> Candi </PERSON> <PERSON> Talarico </PERSON> on June 4 as she played with friends outside her downtown apartment.

 A demonstration that temporarily closed <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> headquarters underscores the desperation of AIDS sufferers hoping for a chemical cure that so far has escaped researchers around the world. The action Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters building in nearby <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, also highlighted a fundamental problem facing the agency charged by law with overseeing the safety and effectiveness of its drugs. In essence, the hundreds of demonstrators _ including more than 100 arrested for blocking entrances to the building _ are asking the agency to recommend experimental AIDS treatments as soon as it determines they are no more dangerous than AIDS itself. The agency says that to do that would eliminate a major reason for its existence: to apply a scientific sorting process that tries to cull quackery from treatments proven safe and effective.

 Federal agents gave new meaning to `` hostile takeover'' by smashing a $ 32 million global money-laundering ring that routed drug profits through a bank to Colombian cocaine cartels, authorities say. Customs agents infiltrated <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> money-laundering syndicates and helped smuggle profits from drug sales out of the country, federal authorities charged Tuesday in a series of indictments naming 85 defendants.

 Negotiators are trying to reach a compromise on sharply differing tax bills passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, one containing a `` taxpayers' bill of rights'' and the other offering relief for 20 million owners of mutual funds. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, which was approved Tuesday night on an 87-1 vote, would cut selected taxes by an estimated $ 3 billion over three years and, to avoid worsening the deficit, boost other taxes by the same amount. The House bill, passed 380-25 on Aug. 4, has a $ 7.5 billion price tag. Far more provisions are identical in both bills. Both would correct hundreds of technical errors in the 1986 tax overhaul; extend several expiring tax benefits; relieve farmers from paying the federal diesel tax on fuel for off-road use, and raise some taxes to pay for the benefits. The tax bill and a comprehensive plan for fighting drug abuse are the only major pieces of legislation standing in the way of adjournment of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, as early as this weekend.

The suit was dismissed, but the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> picked up on the documents and in January 1986, <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges in a federal court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He was sentenced to a year in prison but was allowed to serve part of his sentence at a halfway house in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION> relatives were aghast at the war threatening to tear apart the family and the firm it had built `` The company was a part of my life,'' says <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paolo </PERSON>'s older brother `` I had always smelled the perfume of leather, had always watched my grandfather in the shop in <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, working with so much energy.'' In 1984, <PERSON> Maurizio </PERSON> used his 50 percent of the company to seize control and oust <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON>. The young, bespectacled <PERSON> Maurizio </PERSON> brought in a new team of managers. `` The board decided the company had to be professionally managed,'' explains <PERSON> Cucchiani </PERSON>, one of the young, American-educated executives. But older family members saw it differently. `` <PERSON> Maurizio </PERSON> wanted to overcome the idea of a family firm,'' says his cousin <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON>. Peace did not reign for long. <PERSON> Maurizio </PERSON>'s relatives alleged that the papers giving him half the company on his father's death in 1983 had forged signatures. <PERSON> Maurizio </PERSON>'s shares were frozen. Based on his relatives charges, courts in <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> charged <PERSON> Maurizio </PERSON> with exporting capital and evading taxes. An arrest warrant was issued and <PERSON> Maurizio </PERSON> took refuge in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. To replace him, state-appointed custodians of his shares appointed a <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> business professor, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Martellini </PERSON>. `` A new era has begun,'' <PERSON> Martellini </PERSON> says. `` The company has a place in the market that is more important than the specific problems of the Gucci family.'' Under its new management, the company has launched a program to expand production, standardize the quality of its stores and trim its product line, which had expanded beyond leather goods to 100,000 items. Sales increased by nearly 4 percent, from 229.7 billion lire in 1986 to 238 billion lire in 1987 _ about $ 170 million at current exchange rates. <ORGANIZATION> Guccio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION>'s linked initials still adorn the firm's handbags, luggage and scarves. And in workshops in <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, apron-clad artisans cut black and cobalt-blue alligator skins and guide handbags through sewing machines. But the Guccis are nearly gone rom <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION>. Last spring, <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> and his brothers <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paolo </PERSON> decided to sell most of their shares in the company. The purchaser was <ORGANIZATION> Investcorp </ORGANIZATION>, an Arab investment bank. While a judge ruled in July that 40-year-old <PERSON> Maurizio </PERSON> could return to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, his shares are frozen. If he loses his court cases, he may have to sell some. <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> says he parted with his shares because the new management was not interested in his ideas and the traditional standards. The new managers, however, insist the company will continue to reflect the vision of <ORGANIZATION> Guccio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is a tremendous strength that goes beyond the fights and feuds,'' says <PERSON> Cucchiani </PERSON>. `` The strength is the consumer who wants this brand. The strength is also with the people who work with the company that want the <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION> splendor, and the artisans that want that splendor. `` The name has got a magic connotation.''

 Something special happened when the widower and the divorcee, each 60 years of age, struck up a conversation while they waited in a supermarket checkout line. Before long, they were getting together regularly for dinners, movies and trips to the local museum. They had many shared interests. Their children were grown and well established with families of their own. Neither of them was rich, but both owned homes that had appreciated greatly in value since they had bought them many years before. So after the joyous day of their wedding, they were able to sell those houses, buy a comfortable condominium and put the rest of the proceeds in income-producing investments. What possibly could be wrong with a happy tale like this? Well, not much maybe, but it would have been even better if the sequence of events had been altered just a bit. The couple needlessly forfeited about $ 35,000 that could have paid for, say, a long honeymoon cruise. If they had checked with a good financial adviser, they would have sold their houses first and gotten married afterward. That way, say experts on the subject, each could have claimed a tax break sheltering $ 125,000 of the profits from the sale of their houses. Once they were married, they could claim that exemption only once. The $ 125,000 exemption was written into the tax laws with an intent that is readily apparent _ to make it more practicable for people 55 years of age or older to help finance their later years with proceeds from the sale of a home. But the rules had to be framed so that people were n't encouraged to go into the property-flipping business on their 55th birthdays, cashing in on the tax break over and over again. Thus was it decreed that the exclusion could be taken only once in an individual's, or a couple's, lifetime. `` Both spouses are ineligible for the exclusion if either of them previously claimed it,'' points out the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> KMPG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marwick </ORGANIZATION>. `` Only one exclusion is allowed per couple. Therefore, even if the exclusion was not claimed previously, a married couple can not claim exclusions for two homes. `` Couples who are planning to be married and who both wish to take advantage of the exclusion should sell their residences prior to the marriage.'' In some <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> publications, says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, an adviser on tax and investment planning, the agency says the couple in our story, having sold both houses before taking their nuptial vows, might still run into a snag if they filed a joint tax return. As a married couple, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> material says, they are entitled to just one exemption. But a memo issued last spring `` concludes that the critical time for determining the existence of a marriage is on the date the houses were sold,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> observes. `` If they were sold before the marriage, each is entitled to a $ 125,000 exclusion _ filing a joint return has no impact.'' There are some other fine points about the $ 125,000 exclusion that are noteworthy for anyone using a house as a building block in a retirement savings plan. For one thing, points out the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Deloitte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haskins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sells, you must have owned, and lived in, the home for at least three of the five years preceding the sale to claim the exemption. Also, you could conceivably find yourself in a situation where you might think about passing up the exclusion to save it for use on some future home sale. Says <ORGANIZATION> Deloitte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haskins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sells, `` since this is a one-time exclusion, you should consider carefully the time you decide to use it.''

 <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> recently celebrated the 26th anniversary of `` The Tonight Show,'' but their association goes back four more years. It was 30 years ago when they started working together, when <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> was host of a game show called `` Who Do You Trust?'' and <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> was hired to be the announcer. `` Our relationship was established the very first day,'' <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> recalled. `` I introduced the show, then I brought him the list of questions. He jumped and said, ` <PERSON> Lothar </PERSON>, you startled me!' <PERSON> Lothar </PERSON> was the faithful sidekick to `` Mandrake the Magician'' in the newspaper comic strip. When <PERSON> Mandrake </PERSON>'s magic was n't enough, <PERSON> Lothar </PERSON> supplied the muscle. `` That set our relationship. Lots of humor and kidding.

His many marriages _ it's always good for a joke. His wealth and his passion for privacy. Actually, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> kids himself. He'll say, ` Somebody came to see me, but they got wet when they fell into the moat.''' Their association has lasted longer than any of <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s marriages `` We've never had a disagreement, never had a problem,'' said <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>. `` I think we have a mutual respect for each other. I respect his being the boss. I respect his privacy. We like each other.''

 Teamwork is fast outpacing individual effort in the corporate world, and forward-looking companies are encouraging employee unity through new means that often include an unorthodox business concept: fun. While the company picnic and Christmas party still rank among the most popular extracurricular activities, some companies are relying on more creative means to break down corporate hierarchies and build up team spirit. `` Having fun is absolutely critical because it energizes people,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Flamholtz </PERSON>, professor of human resources at the graduate school of management at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` But, you want to simultaneously develop new skills and insights that can be applied in a practical sense to make the organization more effective.'' Take an all-day seminar for about 70 executives, sales managers and support staff at a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> sales division of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>. Following lunch, guest speaker <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingwage </PERSON> approached the dais, introduced himself as an expert in computer accessing, took a sip of coffee and dropped `` dead.'' Livingwage, also known as <PERSON> Buzz </PERSON> <PERSON> Noe </PERSON>, is an actor and partner in <PERSON> Capers </PERSON>, a company that plans murder mysteries, these days almost exclusively for corporate clients, including <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T employees had been given subtle clues throughout the morning that something was amiss: a shifty waiter who never set down a coffee pot, an appearance by an eccentric British mystery writer -LRB- played by <PERSON> Noe </PERSON>'s wife and partner <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> -RRB- and a Japanese businessman, who was really a Caucasian actor wearing make-up. `` Mr. <PERSON> Moto </PERSON> -LRB- the Japanese character -RRB- was so convincing despite his phony appearance that three <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> employees approached him trying to sell him some telecommunications services,'' <PERSON> Noe </PERSON> said. Entertainment aside, the amateur sleuthhounds, now divided into six teams, got down to the issue at hand: Who killed the speaker and why? After a while, questionnaires were handed out to be answered by the employees individually. Identical forms were then handed to each team to be answered as a whole. The Capers staff then graded the surveys and plotted statistics comparing the individual scores to the team scores. `` The whole idea is that the group should do as well if not better than the individuals,'' Ms. <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> said. `` If that was n't the case, it became clear that they did n't pool their resources or depend on the person who had the most correct answers. The exercise, Ms. <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> said, allows the teamwork concept to get out of the corporate environment and forces people who do not normally interact to communicate with each other. `` It puts everyone on the same level,'' she said. `` It gives the big guy the opportunity to see that he always has something to learn from his support staff.'' But such games are not without their critics. `` It's gimmicky,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON>, adjunct professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, and director of the campus's Center for Operations Management `` It's playing to management's natural desire to simple, quick solutions to what in effect are very complex and involved management issues,'' he said. `` When you look at some of the efforts that have gone into improved teamwork, you find that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spent eight years and several million dollars before employees felt they would not be risking their jobs if they stopped the assembly line because of what they believed was a problem in quality control,'' <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Flamholtz </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> professor, agreed. `` Teambuilding activities that most closely resemble everyday working situations are always more effective than those that do n't,'' he said. But <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T branch manager <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON>, who organized the murder mystery event, said his goal was not to solve his division's management problems `` It certainly helped to break down barriers,'' <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON> said. `` That's the first step. `` If it's fine tuning you're looking for, of course, you'll need more time and a more structured format.''

<HEAD>U.S. Election of Woman Bishop Shakes Anglican Communion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Election of the first woman bishop in the historic apostolic succession rankled some sectors in that tradition, but safeguards had been erected in advance to cushion the shock. These aimed, both in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in which the election occurred and in the world-wide Anglican Communion of which the U. S. church is a part, to stave off ruptures as a result. The event, nevertheless, heightened strains on the issue both domestically and internationally in that 70-million-member household of faith, and frayed unity talks with Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. They also, along with Anglicans, claim a succession of bishops traced back to the time of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>'s apostles and passed on by that lineage, but without women in it. Other churches, including some Protestant bodies with bishops, a few women among them, do n't maintain that ancient succession. The first woman chosen for it, the Rev. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, was elected Sept. 24 by a convention in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> of the Episcopal diocese of <LOCATION> Massacusetts </LOCATION>, as suffragan -LRB- assistant -RRB- bishop. `` For many it is the occasion of great joy and celebration,'' said Episcopal Presiding Bishop <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` For many it is a troubling time'' that `` will test our commitment to the unity of the church.'' It sent tremors through the Anglican world, already in turmoil over the lesser ordination of women clergy in a half dozen of its 28 national branches, including the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, and ruffled some ecumenical counterparts. Roman Catholic Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whealon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, co-chairman of <ORGANIZATION> U. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anglican-Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> talks, called the action a `` major setback'' to sought-for unity. Similar Roman reactions came on the international level. Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, leader of the world's Anglicans, said in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said the event would have `` far-reaching consequences,'' and he pledged to uphold unity `` as we begin to work out the implications. Rumblings of dissent also arose, both domestically and internationally. The Rev. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Polititzer </PERSON>, presdident of the Prayer Book Society of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said its survey of lay members show a majority oppose women bishops. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s Bishop <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, a leading opponent of women priests, said the event will cause deep divisions. `` In common with many other bishops, I would be unable to recognize a woman bishop or the validity of any ordinations or confirmations performed by her,'' he said. A few <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> bishops also hold this view, and so far have declined to recognize even women clergy, although they were authorized by the whole church's convention in 1976, and about 1,200 women have been ordained. Despite continuing tensions over it, both the 2.7-million-member U. S. church and Anglicans internationally have taken steps for living with the differences without breakaing up. With the posibility of a woman bishop being elected in mind, the <ORGANIZATION> Lambeth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, a once-in-l0-years world assembly of Anglicana bishop, in August approved what was called `` the great compromise.'' Passed by an an overwhelming majority of 423 to 28, the bishops of the 28 branches, including both proponents and opponents of female clergy, upheld the right of each branch to decide for itself whether to consecrate women bishops. The measure calls for mutual respect between branches which disagree on the issue, and exercise of courtesy between bishops of differing opinions. Conference resolution are not binding, but carry much weight among members. An international commission was authorized to work out means to hold the communion together once a woman was conscrated a bishop, and Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Eames </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> was named to head the seven-member body. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> said, `` The spirit of the Lambeth Conference has given all the bishops _ including those against the ordination of women _ the inspiration to maintain the highest possible degree of unity with those who differ.'' In a similar backstop measure in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s governing convention last July in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> approved a scheme whereby any congregation rejecting a woman bishop could petition for a male `` Episcopal Visitor'' bishop to administer confirmations. But the woman bishop still would make the periodic pastoral visits required by church law, even to congregations rejecting women bishops. The election of Bishop-elect <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 58, still remains subject to ratification by a majority of the church's bishops and 118 diocesan standing committees. But there was no indication it would be widely challenged. Her consecration and installation is expected to be early next year in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, another woman, the Rev. <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Maris </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, was among nominees for suffragan bishop of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> in an election scheduled Oct. 29.

 <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> was making a big mistake in his 1986 campaign for the presidency of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, said his campaign manager from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Play down domestic economic issues, New Yorker <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Napolitan </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. Instead, emphasize the need for peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> turned around his losing campaign, won the election and went on to father a Central American peace plan that won him the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize. The election was one more victory for the peripatetic Americans who are finding more and more work these days as advisers to foreign political campaigns. For 20 years, Americans have traveled the world to help candidates in both fledgling and longstanding democracies decide which issues are the key to success in their races. They also tutor them in the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electioneering techniques and technology. Sensitive to any suggestion that they change the nature of the political systems they intervene in, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campaign firms and advisers keep a low profile. But Americans have been deeply involved in national elections in more than 30 nations, including <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, with a presidential election scheduled for Nov. 1, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> is getting presidential campaign advice from <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sawyer-Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s firm also advised members of the opposition in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, where a well-organized campaign against the president, Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, resulted this month in voters rejecting his bid for another term. While the Americans claim credit for electing their clients, most of them strenuously deny having any influence in the subsequent policy of the government. The theme of a campaign, however, invariably determines the public's expectations of the winner's policy. `` I think it's the same as in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' acknowledged <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerrell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultants </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't see much difference. They can impact policy; they can change governments.'' Some might think Americans in foreign campaigns would be controversial, with opposition candidates claiming <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manipulation. There's good reason why that rarely happens. `` All the sides use them, so it would be the pot calling the kettle black,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, a professor of political science at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>. For instance, both <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advisers in their presidential election. `` Actually, to people assessing whether to take us or not, it does n't appear to be a question of ` Are we compromising on our values by taking in outsiders?''' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Malloch-Brown </PERSON>, a British adviser from <PERSON> Sawyer-Miller </PERSON>, who advised Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in her 1984-85 presidential campaign. `` The way they see it is, ` If we bring in state-of-the-art techniques, is there a way we can win this election more effectively, more honestly?''' <PERSON> Cerrell </PERSON> agreed that <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' campaign on the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace issue was a prime example of a campaign strategy that had far-reaching implications long after the election. Oddly enough, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> was opposed to that campaign strategy, <PERSON> Napolitan </PERSON> recalls. `` His argument was that everybody's in favor of peace; nobody is in favor of war,'' <PERSON> Napolitan </PERSON> said. `` We agreed with that, but pointed out that the more he started talking about peace, the more he would become identified as the peace candidate. And that's what happened, and to his credit he carried through after the election by coming out with his peace plan.'' Advisers are evasive about how much they earn. They say it is a business secret and that their charges vary widely, depending on the length of a campaign and what services a client needs. Published estimates of charges suggest a national campaign by a top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adviser costs about $ 150,000 for the basic consultant's fee, with expenses tripling the bill <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> said his firm advises some candidates, such as Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, for free. <PERSON> Sawyer-Miller </PERSON> maintains contracts with some clients even after the election. `` To keep a high enough level of mobilization and enthusiasm for the -LRB- political -RRB- goals you're trying to achieve,'' said <PERSON> Malloch-Brown </PERSON>, `` requires a constant political campaign-type dialogue with the population.'' <PERSON> Napolitan </PERSON> has longstanding contracts with Venezuelan parties, where he has been running campaigns since the early 1970s. Campaign advisers typically go to a country, conduct polls to find out what the key issues are among uncommitted voters, then target those `` swing'' issues, which may not be the concerns of the majority of the public. <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, an expert on campaign advisers, believes reliance on advisers and polls to chose campaign themes leads to passive, reaction-oriented government. `` I think there's a natural tension between a representative's role as a delegate, a faithful mirror of the constituency, and as a trustee, someone who is charged with making the right decisions, even if they are unpopular,'' said <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON> `` If you are wedded to polling results, and if they are readily available to you and consultants are constantly whispering in your ear and telling you what people are demanding, you're much more inclined to fulfill your delegate's role to the detriment of your trusteeship.'' The consultants flatly disagree. `` You ca n't have it both ways. Sometimes you have presidents in this country and others who are criticized because they are poorly advised or do n't have advisers,'' said <PERSON> Napolitan </PERSON>. `` You ca n't say the guy should not have advisers; what is the whole government for, really, but to advise the president? What's the difference if he gets expertise inside the country or outside the country? The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultants </ORGANIZATION> has about 125 members, more than half of them American. Most of the rest are from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but there are also Australian, Japanese, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> members. American advisers draw on the experience they gain in the elaborate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campaigns for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the presidency. `` This year, we'll have 400 or 500 elections in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, many of them very hard-fought campaigns with a lot of money being spent,'' said <PERSON> Napolitan </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> has one every five years. ... I work on more elections in a two-year period, for example, than any Latin American has worked on in his life.''

The tall, slender actor, with a beard and moustache, took over the role from <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> after about six episodes. <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON>'s role was written as a throwback to the 1960s But the producers felt the young people who watch the show could n't relate to that. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> is a very contemporary character. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> previously starred as Lt. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> on the first season of CBS' `` The Equalizer'' and was the policeman in hot pursuit of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Belushi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Aykroyd </PERSON> in `` Blues Brothers.'' Prior to taking over the role, he rode with officers from the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` I learned from that how dangerous undercover work is,'' he said. `` They put their lives on the line every day. They deal with the worst element. And when you're undercover it can be emotionally tough because you lose your identity. You start to identify with the other side.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he also asked policemen what they think when they see officers portrayed on television. `` They said they hate seeing cops do dumb things,'' he said. `` You always see a cop stick his finger in dope and taste it. Real cops never do that. It could be some bad stuff and they'd die. You see cops check their weapons with all the sound effects _ click, click, click! Cops know their weapons; they do n't have to do that.'' `` 21 Jump Street'' is currently <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s third highest-rated show, behind `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted'' and `` Married ... With Children.'' It was the fledgling network's top show before the debut of `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted.'' The show recently received a Presidential Citation for tackling such issues as teen-age drug abuse, AIDS, gang violence, runaways, child abuse and pornography. It has also frequently provided hotline numbers where youths can find help. `` My character has gone undercover a few times,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` Once as a uniformed cop and once as a man looking for a loan. I could go undercover as a teacher to look for guns in a school. The show provides an opportunity for me to stretch as an actor. `` I'd like to work undercover as a priest, as a bum, a nightclub singer. You can play a lot of different attitudes. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> could even go undercover and do a school production of ` Othello.''' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, but he spent time with his father in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, his mother in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and his maternal grandparents in <LOCATION> Millington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. He discovered acting while in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He was a boxer, and he and a friend began to stage mock fights to develop their timing and reflexes. That led to an interest in acting. On his return to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, he became a model, then got into local theater when he returned to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. He also appeared in a number of movies filmed in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> _ `` Mahogany,'' `` <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> <PERSON> High </PERSON>,'' `` Dummy'' and `` Blues Brothers.'' He moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in 1980 and immediately was cast in various series and feature and TV movies.

 The political coverup in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` Favorite Son'' might have worked if the conspirators had n't underestimated the cynical, jaded, veteran <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent assigned to the case An unknown sniper has assassinated a Contra leader and wounded a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator on the Capitol steps, and the president's chief of staff does n't want the case solved. So the case goes to <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent on the verge of retirement, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, an inexperienced young agent. `` He's not over the hill,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Loggia </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON>. `` He's being forced to retire at 55, because that's <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> policy. He's a maverick agent, which exists in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. They're not all plastic men. The heavies pick him, because they think he's past his prime, and the kid's a greenhorn. A couple of stiffs who'll botch the job `` <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON>'s the conscience of the piece. I guess in his own way he's the real patriot of the piece. He's a man doing his job well, serving his country well. He can make a difference as an individual.'' `` Favorite Son,'' which centers on a plot to win the presidential nomination, will air just one week before the real presidential election. The six-hour, three-part miniseries, based on the best-selling political thriller by <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohmer </PERSON>, runs Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, Oct. 31-Nov. 2 <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON> stars as an ambitious young senator, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozlowski </PERSON> as his even more ambitious image-maker, <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Guest </PERSON> as <PERSON> Loggia </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> partner, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmore </PERSON> as the president, <PERSON> Stepfanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> as the producer of a TV morning show, <PERSON> Ronny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> as the head of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> as the head of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> as the vice president. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bleckner </PERSON> directed from <PERSON> Sohmer </PERSON>'s screenplay `` Favorite Son'' is a powerful story of corruption in high places, and as the suspense builds, viewers will be guessing until the end which are the good guys and which are the villains. The complex story functions on several levels. It's a thriller about a murderous plot to capture the presidential nomination. It examines the power of television in making or breaking a candidate. And it's a vehicle that could lead to a series for <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Loggia </PERSON>, one of the hottest and most talented character actors in movies and television. `` It could be a pilot, but there are a few other steps,'' said <PERSON> Loggia </PERSON>. `` We might do a movie-of-the-week on <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON>. It's a really a case of wait-and-see. See what kind of ratings numbers it gets. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON> is a good character, but I do n't know if it can be projected into a series.'' <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON> is similar to <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ransom </PERSON>, the rumpled detective that earned an Oscar nomination for <PERSON> Loggia </PERSON> in the feature film `` The Jagged Edge.'' <PERSON> Loggia </PERSON> calls <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> an Italian version of <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>. `` We did n't do this picture with <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> cooperation,'' said <PERSON> Loggia </PERSON>. `` But when we did ` An Officer and a Gentleman,' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was very apprehensive and did n't cooperate. Then afterward, it came to be used by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> as a recruiting film. I would n't be surprised if a lot of young guys sign up for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> after seeing this miniseries. We see <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON> go full out. You see what makes him tick. In the end, the resolution of this character is very positive.'' <PERSON> Loggia </PERSON>'s acting career goes back to the days of live television. He starred in two series, `` The Nine Lives of <PERSON> Elfego </PERSON> <PERSON> Baca </PERSON>'' in 1958 on the Disney show and `` T.H.E. Cat'' in 1966-67. But in recent years, his career has exploded. It started with his role as a boozing sailor in `` An Officer and a Gentleman.'' He was a Cuban drug kingpin in `` Scarface,'' a Mafia lawyer in `` Prizzi's Honor,'' a detective in `` The Believers,'' <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> in `` A Woman Called Golda,'' a beachcomber in `` Hot Pursuit,'' the murderous school principal in `` Echoes in the Darkness'' and a warmhearted toy manufacturer in the current hit `` Big.'' `` I got a nomination for ` Jagged Edge,' which was n't expected,'' he said. `` The producer and director did n't expect the role to have that kind of impact. It's not a bad way to work, to give more than they expect. The best thing is you're not trapped in a heavy or ethnic role. `` I think you aim for this kind of thing. You can be a one-trick pony or have a whole bag of tricks. I guess what we're at now is to go from character supporting actor to character leading man. I'd certainly rather carry the ball I think ` Favorite Son' will help in this.'' <PERSON> Loggia </PERSON> recently returned from <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> where he co-starred with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerwin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Krige </PERSON> in a spy movie. A permanent title has n't been selected, but it's been known as `` Spies on Ice'' and `` Spooks.'' Next, he goes to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to play the father in a family drama for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> called `` The <ORGANIZATION> O'Connors </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` It's a morality conflict,'' he said. `` We're an Irish Catholic family. One son's a priest, one's in real estate at a heavy level. <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Linden </PERSON> plays a big real estate operator.''

 The drought was the last thing <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s public schools needed Long renowned for above-average test scores and graduation rates, the schools are sinking into a worsening financial crisis that began when oil and farm prices slumped six years ago. Educators now fear the state's economic woes will speed the departure of two of its most precious resources: its teachers and its children.

 The drought that laid waste millions of acres of wheat and grazing land across the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> now threatens to create a new victim: <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s already hard-pressed schools. Few states are suffering more acutely from the drought than <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, whose highly regarded schools were already reeling from a prolonged slump in crop and energy prices. Drought-affected states like <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> have cut or frozen education spending this year. But <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s current state appropriation of $ 346.4 million is fully $ 42 million less than it spent on public schools seven years ago. `` How serious is the drought for our schools? On a scale of one to 10, it is about an eight. It's very serious. It would n't have been so serious if we had n't been struggling for the last six years with the oil problem,'' said Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON>. The drought has so far cost this economically depressed state $ 2 billion, a 10 percent drop in the state's gross product, <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> said in an interview. At a time when the push for school reform was prompting many states to boost spending, Sinner this fall had to cut school aid 2 percent, or $ 9 million, the fourth education cut in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> in as many years. The latest cut means state aid dropped by $ 52 per pupil. Spending per pupil is $ 3,481, 31st in the nation. Six years ago, the state ranked 23rd. Teacher salaries average $ 21,660, 47th in the nation. Six years ago, they ranked 30th. Yet in many ways, the crisis is paradoxical. North Dakotans from the governor on down tend to regard public schools, for all their apparent troubles, as a comparative bright spot in the state's picture The state's 118,000 students generally score well in tests of basic skills. Ninety percent graduate from high school, the third best rate in the nation, although educators concede that's at least partly because school is the only game in town for rural youngsters, especially in hard times. A statewide poll last September by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> found that 41 percent of respondents think schools have improved from five years ago; a comparable Gallup poll conducted nationwide found just 25 percent of respondents felt that way about their schools. Demographically, the schools have much going for them. The state has fewer single-parent families than the national average. North Dakotans are ethnically homogeneous. The state has a long, ardent tradition of support for public education. Many here refer glowingly to the `` prairie ethic,'' the toughness of the early German and Scandinavian settlers who a century ago turned this harsh land into the nation's leading wheat producer. Yet that very ethic may be making <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakotans </LOCATION> slow to react to the schools crisis, educators fear. There is practically no chance for new state taxes this year to bail out schools, said state senator <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s education finance committee `` The prairie ethic is a double-edged sword because we've got to change. We ca n't just ask, how did our ancestors tough it out before?'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Smette </PERSON>, superintendent of the <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> school district, located in the western section of the state hardest hit by the agricultural and energy slumps. The biggest fear is that the drought will hasten the already pronounced exodus of teachers and young people. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> has become a favorite recruiting ground for teachers, especially for districts in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> that promise higher salaries and appealing lifestyles, said <PERSON> Peg </PERSON> <PERSON> Portscheller </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Right now the talk -LRB- among teachers -RRB- of leaving is more than at any time I've ever heard,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, a guidance counselor at <ORGANIZATION> Dickinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Seventy percent of young <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakotans </LOCATION> are leaving the state after finishing school, said <PERSON> Portscheller </PERSON>. In the most depressed places like <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, it's worse. A visitor asked 50 high school seniors at <ORGANIZATION> Dickinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> if they would stay in the state. One said he would. `` I do n't think there are a lot of job opportunities here,'' said <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Fruh </PERSON>, 17, who plans to attend the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> next year. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, president of <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>'s board of education, said, `` I've got a brother in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, a brother in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, my sister left for <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> to look for work, another sister's in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, and my folks are in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. I would n't be surprised if my three kids leave someday. That's the story of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>.'' Leaving the state is `` not necessarily what kids want. But we're not giving them the opportunity to dream, to explore, to build,'' said <PERSON> Portscheller </PERSON> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> ranks 50th in the number of students enrolled in advanced placement high school classes. Many schools lack art programs and offer little or no advanced math or science. Only 19 percent of high school students take a foreign language, compared with a third of high schoolers nationwide. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> `` reform is n't on the backburner. It is n't even on the stove,'' said <PERSON> Portscheller </PERSON>. `` Most people in this state think schools are OK. But educators generally agree that we're in a state of crisis. We've put children on hold,'' she said. `` We do a good job with basic skills ... but if you look beyond the basics, like problem solving and the ability to make good decisions, I'm not sure we're cutting the mustard.'' In <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, where teachers and administrators have already been laid off, there is talk of eliminating entire programs if the economy does n't improve. Science labs at <ORGANIZATION> Dickinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> are short of specimens, microscopes and other equipment. The elementary school has no central library and just one instructional computer. The <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> district cut $ 1.2 million from its budget in the last two years. The current $ 9.8 million budget includes a $ 500,000 deficit that will almost certainly lead to more cuts and possibly layoffs. As area oil jobs have disappeared and farm prices have dropped, land values have declined and school budgets heavily dependent on property taxes have suffered accordingly. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>'s property tax valuations have dropped from a high of $ 24 million in 1984 to a current $ 17 million. Local real estate agent <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Karn </PERSON> said homes that sold for $ 68,000 four years ago now go for $ 32,000. For many small districts, the drought may prove the last straw before consolidation _ a dreaded step in isolated towns where having a school is what keeps them on the map. But many such districts barely meet minimum standards, according to a report on <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> school problems issued last January. State Sen. <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> sighed when asked about the future of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> schools. `` There's always hope,'' she said. `` If the feds come up with a great drought program, if we can get some light industry, if <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> lets oil prices go up a bit. And if it would rain.''

The contract for the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude settled at $ 13.55, down 5 cents from Monday's close. Like Monday's session _ when <ORGANIZATION> November </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> climbed 66 cents _ Tuesday's trading was dominated by rumors and speculation about production by the 13-members Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, analysts said. Prices rose Monday as <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the world's largest oil exporter, reaffirmed it would stick to its production quota if other members of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> did. On Tuesday, prices again moved higher, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Redoglia </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>. But the market turned lower when Saudi King Fahd failed to discuss <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member's inability to stay within their output quotas during an address, <PERSON> Redoglia </PERSON> said Rumors that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> was willing to cut its production then hit the market, and prices advanced again before finally slipping lower at the end of the day, he said. <PERSON> Redoglia </PERSON>, who described trading as volatile, attributed Tuesday's brief rallies to short covering, in which investors buy contracts to offset those they sold earlier. He said the market's underlying fundamentals remained negative. `` The bearishness about <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> overproduction is still there,'' he said, predicting, `` the market is going to continue trading like this'' until <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> can resolve its differences. In other trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 0.62 cent to settle at 40.79 cents a gallon, while home heating oil rose 0.12 cent to 39.08 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Bond Sales Slip Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Savings Bonds dropped for the fifth time in six months in September, falling 10.8 percent to $ 519 million, according to the government. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that September sales were $ 63 million lower than in August, when they had risen 3.4 percent from the month before. Sales had fallen by 8.5 percent in July, 6.1 percent in June, 0.9 percent in May and 6.4 percent in April. Before that, sales rose for eight months in a row, hitting $ 706 million in March. September sales were up 9.5 percent from the same month a year ago. But sales for fiscal year 1988, which ended Sept. 30, totaled $ 7.26 billion, a 29.5 percent decline from fiscal 1987, when sales set a post-World War II record of $ 10.3 billion. Since November 1982, savings bonds held five years or longer earn market-based interest rates. The current rate, in effect through the end of this month, is 6.90 percent, down from 7.17 percent in the six months ended April 30. When market interest rates rise relative to savings bonds, as they have since March, bond sales tend to decline. A new savings bond rate, which will likely be higher, will be announced Nov. 1. Effective Sept. 30, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> scrapped a five-month experiment to bolster sales by offering consumers a toll-free, 24-hour telephone number to purchase bonds using a credit card. The program `` proved not cost-effective,'' the department said.

 The dollar dropped sharply against the Japanese yen today for the second straight day, while share prices edged down on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar finished trading at 129.65 yen, down 1.50 yen from Tuesday's close of 131.15 yen. This is the lowest since Jun. 24, when it closed at 129.70 yen. Opening at 131.12 yen, the currency moved between 129.60 yen and 131.38 yen. On Tuesday the dollar plummeted 2.35 yen, dropping from Friday's close of 133.50 yen `` Speculative investors' dollar-selling dominated the trading, and hardly anybody was buying the dollar,'' a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said today. The release in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of unemployment in September, which fell to 5.4 percent, ended concern over inflation and lowered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates, he said. `` So it is no longer profitable for investors to buy the currency with lower interest rates,'' the dealer said.

 The wedding invitations, printed in delicate script, were mailed to a select group of international bankers promising a grand affair. But the `` bride'' and `` groom'' were really undercover federal agents and the nuptials were a charade which resulted in the arrest of 11 party-goers linked to an alleged international drug and money-laundering operation. Seven of the 11 were nabbed Saturday night as they rolled into <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> in chauffeured limousines for what was supposed to be a wild bachelor party in a penthouse suite. `` They thought they were really going to a stag party. Not a one of them had any idea of what was going on,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, assistant special agent in charge of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs office in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, said Tuesday after indictments were unsealed naming 85 defendants, including an international bank. Individuals in 10 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> were accused of participating in a ring that laundered profits for the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> cocaine trade through the Luxembourg-based <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> BCCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> BCCI </ORGANIZATION>, two subsidiaries and nine bank officials were charged with laundering $ 14 million in drug profits collected in seven <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities. The elaborate wedding ruse began months ago when federal authorities tried to come up with a way to arrest as many suspects at once to reduce the chances they would escape. `` A wedding was a perfect opportunity,'' <PERSON> Ladow </PERSON> said. An undercover Customs agent had infiltrated the alleged money laundering operation posing as a financier and investor. As his relationship with suspects developed, he introduced a woman he said was his fiancee and business partner. The couple became a part of the suspects' social and business scene, traveling to parties, dinner engagements and sporting events, including a championship boxing match in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, authorities said. Six months ago they announced their engagement. Invitations went out for the marriage of <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrine </PERSON> <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Musella </PERSON>, the agents' fictitious names. The affair was set for Sunday at the exclusive <ORGANIZATION> Innisbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resort </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Tarpon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, 35 miles northewest of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. Federal agents did not tip the resort to their plan. As guests and their families arrived they were greeted by undercover agents posing as friends of the happy couple and were wined and dined at cocktail parties. Eight to 10 limousines ferried party-goers to <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> for the bachelor bash. `` We had undercover agents in the cars,'' <PERSON> Ladow </PERSON> said. `` All the way over, there were comments about, ` Hey, we're going to party tonight.''' When the bankers stepped off an elevator into the arm of waiting agents they did n't understand what was happening, officials said. One suspect apparently had been to a recent striptease party where a dancer placed handcuffs on him before her bump-and-grind routine. So when the handcuffs were slapped on him Saturday night, he did n't get upset, according to agents. `` He was all smiles. He said, ` All right, let's party!''' said <PERSON> Ladow </PERSON>. `` He thought it was a prelude to the same thing.'' But as things began to sink in, another suspect moaned: `` I thought they could only do this in the movies.''

<TEXT>
 The broiler, a tender young chicken that does n't live to a ripe old age, is gradually becoming a locally grown food item in the Third World instead of an imported delicacy, says <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analyst ary Vocke. One reason has been the modernization of chicken production in some Third World countries, where technology and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain have been used to begin or expand domestic broiler industries. `` For example,'' he said, `` the grandparents of a broiler raised in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> may be from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the corn in his -LRB- feed -RRB- ration from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and the soybean meal from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Vocke </PERSON> added: `` The automated feeding equipment that delivers the ration may be from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Saudi Arabian family that eats this broiler probably used to eat chicken from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Because of the rapid growth of poultry production, the Third World has become a net importer of coarse grains such as corn and sorghum, he said. And continued expansion `` will likely create even more markets'' for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other grain exporters. <PERSON> Vocke </PERSON>, who works in the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, described Third World poultry development and its impact on trade in a new report on world agriculture. The countries listed as major chicken meat importers included <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Third World exporters included <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. Modern broiler production, even in countries that are short on feed, does n't have to be linked to land and climate, the way crop production is. `` Raising broilers has become an industrial activity, the final step in the production process,'' <PERSON> Vocke </PERSON> said. `` The first step includes grain producers and foundation poultry breeders. The grain and breeding stock they produce are inputs for feed manufacturing and hatching egg operations.'' The feed rations and young chicks are the ingredients for the final step, raising the chicks to market size. Because grain and breeding stock are easily transported, broilers can be raised almost anywhere. <PERSON> Vocke </PERSON> noted that the broiler industry, which was pioneered in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and raised to a high degree of specialization, is relatively new. Sixty years ago chickens were raised mostly for eggs by farm families. Chicken meat, from young `` fryers'' and old hens, was a byproduct. City consumers found chicken often expensive relative to pork and beef. In grandmother's time, chicken on Sunday was a family treat. `` These conditions are not much different from those found in many Third World countries today,'' <PERSON> Vocke </PERSON> said. `` Few foresaw the technological and organizational innovations that created the broiler industry.'' The integration of the industry from feed preparation to slaughter and marketing resulted in reduced broiler production costs and lower retail prices. Broilers made a hit with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> shoppers and consumption levels rose. It is this experience that is being relived in the Third World. But <PERSON> Vocke </PERSON> said the technology transfer to the countries beginning to expand poultry output requires money, or foreign exchange, for the purchase of hatching and growing facilities. `` Feed mills for preparing rations are a high priority,'' he said. `` A local mill can reduce the recurring cost of importing feeds, even if some of the ingredients still have to be imported.'' Also, storage bins and equipment for feed ingredients may have to be imported, and if slaughtering is to be done in modern plants, that could mean further import spending. `` In traditional markets, chickens are sold live and often slaughtered on the spot,'' <PERSON> Vocke </PERSON> said. `` With urbanization and increasing concern about sanitation, slaughtering in plants becomes more common.'' Broiler productivity has been hampered by the shortage of foreign exchange in some Third World countries, he said. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, for example, is self-sufficient in grains but has a lack of foreign exchange to import vitamins, medicines and minerals for use in higher quality feed. The developing broiler industries are also hurt if they ca n't import chicks or hatching eggs from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> <PERSON> Vocke </PERSON> said that the proportion of total poultry output coming from modern operations is estimated at between a third and two-thirds in the lower-income countries of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` In the higher income countries of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the proportion is between 70 percent and 90 percent,'' he said. In some <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> countries, it is above 90 percent.'' But broilers are not always the locally favored source of animal protein, <PERSON> Vocke </PERSON> said. And, unlike chickens, grazing cattle, sheep and goats do n't compete with humans for grains grown for domestic consumption or for foreign exchange to import grains. `` Some countries, however, do not have sufficient land or a suitable climate either to provide grazing for ruminants -LRB- such as cattle and goats -RRB- or to grow grain to feed poultry or pigs,'' he said. `` When demand for animal proteins grows, countries can import meat, or, in the case of broilers, may import the production technology and the feed ingredients to raise the birds locally.''

<HEAD>Jumbo Jet Deliveries Delayed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Deliveries of some of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s new 747-400 jumbo jets will be delayed by a month or so, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> operating company, said Tuesday that of the 161 747-400s ordered by 21 customers, 20 planes will be delivered an average of one month past the previously agreed upon date. `` We intend to obtain <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> certification of the 747-400 in December, to deliver the first two aircraft that month and to be back on our original schedule by mid-1989,'' <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said. Two deliveries will be pushed back from December to early 1989, and there will be a substantial reduction in first-quarter 1989 deliveries, the company said in a news release. Most of the deliveries will be made up in the second quarter of 1989, it said. <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said far more orders for the new jet were received from customers on an earlier schedule than anticipated when the program was launched in October 1985. <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said the delays are due to the increase of 747 production rates at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s Everett plant from two planes to five a month and to customers seeking a wider variety of plane configurations than on earlier programs. The delays also stem from the 747-400s being offered with three different engine types, with each being introduced and certified in a record four months. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is doing its best to minimize the impact of the delays on customers, <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said, including working overtime and reassigning additional experienced workers to the 747 plant. The new jet, which made its first flight earlier this year, is the largest commercial jet in production. The plane will be able to carry 412 passengers more than 8,000 miles, and greater passenger loads on shorter trips.

<TEXT>
 Wheat futures prices were slightly lower while corn and soybeans futures were a bit higher in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat prices were pressured by fears that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may revive their recently expired grain agreement for one year rather than sign a new, multi-year pact, said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leow </PERSON>, a grain and soybean analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators are scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to discuss the possibility of a new multi-year agreement. Corn and soybean prices opened slightly higher, but trading activity was light and cautious ahead of this afternoon's revised crop production report from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Things are usually dead ahead of a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report,'' Ms. <PERSON> Leow </PERSON> said. In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.33 a bushel; corn was 1 \ cents to 1 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.96 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with December at $ 2.56 a bushel; soybeans were -LCB- cent to 2 cents higher with November at $ 7.95 a Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .15 cent to .60 cent higher with October at 72.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .53 cent higher with October at 81.90 cents a pound; hogs were .07 cent lower to .25 cent higher with October at 40.15 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .15 cent to .70 cent higher with February at 48.15 cents a pound. Cattle futures settled slightly lower Tuesday while pork futures were mixed.

<TEXT>
 British <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> announced today they were buyers of portions of <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s oil and gas properties <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>, part of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch-Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said it would buy <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s Colombian operations for $ 500 million, while <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> said it was the successful bidder for a hodgepodge of <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s international oil and gas interests with a $ 194.5 million offer On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> estimated the net proceeds from its asset sale would be $ 6.4 billion on a gross take of $ 7.3 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is auctioning its oil and gas interests to pay down $ 8.5 billion in debt and to concentrate on its pipeline and industrial businesses. On Monday, eight other companies announced they were buying various parts of the oil and gas properties. The main Colombian operation <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> is buying is <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colombia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, which is currently producing about 40,000 barrels a day. Output from <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s Colombian interests have been restrained by pipeline constraints, and production will rise when a new pipeline is installed, said a <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, who was not identified, in accordance with British custom. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> already has a 25 percent stake in the <LOCATION> Cano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Limon </LOCATION> field in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, which it acquired when it bought <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s Colombian operations in 1985. The field produces about 170,000 barrels a day. British Gas' purchase is a major step in its diversification efforts since it was privatized by the government in late 1986. British Gas said it was buying all of <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s non-North American oil interests, excluding those in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The purchase includes interests in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Eygpt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. British Gas said the interests contain estimated proven and probable reserves of 47 million barrels of oil equivalent. About two-third's of the reserves are oil. British Gas has been increasing its non-gas and non-British activities since its privatization. In 1987 it bought <ORGANIZATION> Acre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> for 370 million pounds, or $ 640 million, and bought 51 percent of Canada-based <ORGANIZATION> Bow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> after a protracted battle with Canadian regulators. In September, British Gas launched a `` dawn raid'' on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Scottish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> Lasmo </ORGANIZATION>, but only managed to get about 1.1 percent of the company's stock, well short of its stated intention of buying 14.9 percent. Among the transactions announced Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> oil and natural gas reserves, production facilities and leasehold interests for nearly $ 2.6 billion. In other deals: _ <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy the mid-continent division oil and gas subsidiary for $ 715 million _ <ORGANIZATION> Fina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petrofina </ORGANIZATION>'s principal operating subsidiary, agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s Gulf Coast-Southwestern exploration and production business in a stock purchase plan valued at a little more than $ 600 million _ <ORGANIZATION> Seagull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> signed letters of intent to buy the outstanding capital stock of <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>, for $ 16.4 million _ <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced it signed a definitive agreement to buy <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chalmette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, refinery and related facilities for $ 560 million and an adjustment for working capital _ <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is buying <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> operations for between $ 670 million and $ 700 million while <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> division for $ 900 million _ A subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Conoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to purchase the Norwegian affiliate of <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> for $ 115 million After the sale, company officials said, <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> will comprise 31 percent farm and construction equipment, 23 percent pipeline, 14 percent shipbuilding, 13 percent auto parts, 10 percent packaging and 9 percent chemical.

 <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has bought the profitable <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> shuttle from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 365 million cash and will rename it after himself, it was announced today, but <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s militant union leaders called the sale the death of the airline and vowed a fight `` I want to run it as a diamond, an absolute diamond,'' the flamboyant real estate-gambling mogul proclaimed to reporters at a joint news conference with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> at the Plaza Hotel in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, another recent Trump acquisition. `` You're going to be flying with something that's quality and good,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said of the moneymaking commuter service between the heavily traveled cities of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He said the shuttle will now be called `` The Trump Shuttle'' and its blue-silver <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s will be redecorated and emblazoned with red, black and gold stripes. The deal is expected to be completed by mid-December. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> told reporters the sale was `` not our preferrred course.'' But he said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s militant unions had created a situation that deprived management of the right to negotiate. The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> chief also confirmed speculation he had talked with takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, about selling him other operations of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s company bought two years ago, creating the nation's biggest airline company <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> also owns <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, a non-union carrier based in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said the shuttle will maintain fares competitive with the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> shuttle service operated by <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and wo n't lay off any employees. The $ 365 million cash acquisition, substantially above previous estimates of the shuttle's sale price, includes landing rights at airports in the three shuttle cities plus 17 planes. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> noted recent reports that he intends to sell the land earmarked for a huge new commercial development in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to help finance the Shuttle deal. No interested party could afford to pay him what the 100-acre site is worth, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> joked to reporters. The sale marks another tumultuous chapter in the saga of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, the Miami-based carrier that has been scarred by management-labor feuding and $ 1 billion in losses over the past decade. The shuttle is considered Eastern's crown jewel. Eastern officials testified recently that the shuttle is the airline's only remaining profitable operation. When word of the deal leaked earlier today, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s machinists vowed to seek a federal court order against it. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrieri </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, said he was readying a request to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to grant an injunction against the sale and would file it later this week. `` The sale of the shuttle is the death knell of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> as we know it. We just ca n't allow the employees to be walked over in this manner. We intend to keep <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> a viable entity by seeking to enjoin this sale,'' <PERSON> Guerrieri </PERSON> said by telephone. Eastern spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> confirmed pilots and flight attendants unions were informed of the sale today but did not disclose details. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Currier </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> local representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management had told the union a copy of the agreement would be sent to the unions later. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> local representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots, said earlier that his union opposes the sale and `` we will take whatever legal means is possible.'' The shuttle was made into a separate division last year, clearing the way for a possible sale. In February 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> announced plans to sell the new division for $ 225 million cash and marketable securities to <ORGANIZATION> Air-Shuttle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION>, a new subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> blocked the plan with a contempt of court finding against Eastern in March. A federal appeals court reversed the contempt order in June but left the door open for the unions to continue legal action. In July, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> announced the cancellation of the plan. Reports surfaced recently that the shuttle was again for sale _ this time to an outside buyer. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s desire for the shuttle became known last week.

 <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> guru <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jobs </PERSON> arranged a grand debut today for his latest attempt to put high-powered computers into the hands of the ordinary person _ the Next computer workstation. The 2 -LCB- - hour product demonstration in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s swank <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> Symphony Hall before 3,000 guests comes a year after it had been promised, prompting critics to dub the secrecy-shrouded machine the `` Eventually. The computer wo n't immediately be available, and <ORGANIZATION> Next </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, so far has refused to say when the machine will be on the market. Besides its release date, the big question is the machine's price tag Next's machine is designed with the power of an engineering workstation, the kind that normally sells for upwards of $ 30,000 to $ 50,000. Jobs has promised to offer it for considerably less, but just how much less is unknown. Analysts early on speculated the machine would range from $ 3,000 to $ 5,000, but estimates now range up to $ 7,000 to $ 10,000. Jobs, who co-founded <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 in his parents' garage, has said the Next computer was initially designed for college students and academic researchers, although analysts believe he now envisions a wider market It's been speculated his machine will be capable of competing with such hot-selling technical workstations as those from <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsytems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Apollo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Some of those companies are working on similar products that eventually will be sold for about $ 15,000. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Seybold </PERSON>, a leading Los Angeles-based trade publisher who has seen the Next, says industry critics `` ... all going to change their minds'' after the machine's debut. `` From a hardware and software standpoint, this is a remarkable achievement ... and will have a significant impact that will spread well beyond the number of computers Next will sell,'' he said in a recent interview. Some details of the computer have leaked out, the most reliable one being its unusual visual design with a black magnesium case and 17-inch monochrome monitor. Dazzling Display Postscript software by Adobe Systems and other software are widely expected to give exceptionally vivid graphics _ possibly offering photo-like realism _ and numerous type fonts and sizes. A laser printer also is expected to be offered, which would vastly improve industry reproduction quality standards. In hardware, the Next is expected to come with an erasable optical disk drive, which could increase current computer storage as much as 50 times, allow the storage of detailed images such as photographs and give stereo-sound capability. Jobs himself has indicated the computer will have a 32-bit Motorola 68030 chip, the industry's fastest; a connector to an industry standard network called Ethernet that will allow Next to share files with other types of computers; and <LOCATION> Mathematica </LOCATION> software, of special use for sophisticated math equations. `` This is going to be the biggest little computer in the world,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, an independent <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> software specialist. A computer workstation is a machine about halfway between the computing capabilities of a personal computer and a mainframe.

 The baby of the <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> family has grown _ not up, but stronger and longer. Redesigned for the 1988 model year, the Civic Hatchback DX showed just how far the Honda Civic has come since its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> introduction in March 1973. Back then, the car was 146.9 inches long, with 86.6-inch wheelbase and curb weight of 1,605 pounds. It looked something akin to a beer can on wheels. The 1988 Civic Hatchback DX test car was 9.2 inches longer, nearly 400 pounds heavier and had a wheelbase that had grown by nearly 12 inches. Add the new model's 1.5-liter, 16-valve, fuel-injected, four-cylinder engine _ the early Civic had a puny 1,200-cc engine in 1973 _ and this is no beer can any longer. The Civic line, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s lowest-priced car line, offers sedan, hatchback and wagon models. But it does n't get just first-time car owners. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> said median age of buyers of the test car, the Hatchback DX, is about 35, and median household income is $ 38,300. Spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Butorac </PERSON> said 59.4 percent are male and 76.3 percent have college education. The Civic line has done well over the years. Looking at the previous Civic redesign beginning in the 1984 model year, for example, sales increased steadily, from 136,401 in calendar 1984 to 173,110 in 1987. That's a far cry from the 38,957 Civics sold in calendar 1973. Price has increased, too. Base price for the Hatchback DX is $ 8,310 compared with $ 2,250 for a hatchback Civic in 1973. Competition also has changed. Today, the Civic faces a number of subcompact rivals, some with lower starting prices. Among them are the Toyota Corolla FX, which starts around $ 8,000, and <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> 323, which starts at more than $ 6,000. There's also the subcompact Hyundai Excel hatchback, which starts at $ 5,395. But <PERSON> Butorac </PERSON> said the Civic has a substantially different class of standard features and a substantially different powertrain, and <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> does n't consider the <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> a direct competitor. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> officials name the Civic as one of their competitors, however. The test Civic Hatchback DX showed why, even with all the competition, some buyers still decide on the Civic. Fit and finish was excellent inside and out. The car, with five-speed manual transmission, was peppy, thanks to the the 90 horsepower the engine can crank out. The engine is standard in the Hatchback DX, but a 70-horspower version is standard in regular Civic Hatchback model. The car was fun to drive around town, and fit in small parking spaces easily _ most of the time. At times, however, such as when the car was at a standstill, it took effort to move the steering wheel. There was no power steering. On the highway, the car moved well, but the ride could be punishing, jostling. There also was a fair amount of road noise. But fuel economy was admirable, with the car getting 30-plus miles to the gallon in demanding driving in both the city and on the highway. The interior was pleasant, with easy to read gauges and molded-type front bucket seats that looked modern. Rear legroom was nearly nonexistent if the front seats were pushed all the way back and reclined some. There were three seat belts in the back, but three adults would have a tough time sitting there for long. The car had nice touches. To the left of the driver was a small drawer for coins. The hatchback area was covered by a ledge that hid items stored below. The ledge doubled as a shelf for the rear seat. If more cargo room was needed, the split rear seat folded down. While the 1988 redesigned Civic is too new for reliability tests, past Consumer Reports rankings based on owner reports of trouble showed 1982-86 Civics had a much better than average rating.

<TEXT>
 A day after the board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> approved a defense plan against hostile takeovers, rival poultry processor <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> made a $ 1 billion offer to buy the company. Springdale-based <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, the nation's largest poultry processor, on Tuesday offered $ 45 cash and a quarter share of its Class A common stock for each of <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> 18.1 million outstanding shares. The deal would be worth $ 1 billion based on Tuesday's closing prices: <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> closed at $ 43 a share, up $ 2.37 -LCB- in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, while <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> rose 62.5 cents a share to $ 17.62 -LCB- in national over-the-counter trading. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said today its board of directors would consider the offer `` in due course'' but declined further comment. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Justice </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> executive vice president for community relations, said <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> general counsel <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> would not be available to answer questions Tuesday night. Several hours before <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> announced its offer, <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> had announced it had been approached by an unidentified company regarding a possible business combination. <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Farms </PERSON> said no specific proposal had been received and <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Farms </PERSON> did not intend to seek one. `` The board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> believes the best long-term interests of the company and its shareholders will be served by the company continuing to operate as an independent entity,'' stated <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, president and chief and executive officer. The company also said it had activated a shareholder rights plan, commonly known as a `` poison pill'' takeover defense, aimed at making a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive. In a letter to <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, son of the company's founder, referred to a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> officials four weeks ago in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> and said he believed it was an ideal time for the companies to merge. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> said the offer would expire by close of business Oct. 19 and asked for access to nonpublic corporate information from <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> to help determine whether his company might increase its offer. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> is a wholly-integrated poultry company which produces 14 million pounds of chicken meat a week, according to Justice. Justice said <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> has hatcheries, grows its own chickens, operates its own feed mills, has its own processing plants and markets both whole chickens and `` value enhanced products'' to supermarkets, fast food chains, and institutional customers. According to the company's 1987 annual report, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> had gross sales last year of about $ 1.8 billion, with net income of $ 67 million. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> has 25,600 employees, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Farms </PERSON> is a diversified foods company, with about 50 percent of its sales concentrated in chicken. The company also provides other meats for the food service industry and mills flour. <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> apparently made its announcement before receiving the <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> proposal, stating that it had not received any written proposals. <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> declined to comment at that time on how many businesses had expressed interest in a merger or which companies were involved. `` We remain committed to our shareholders, a leader in long-term investment performance for shareholders, a leader in long-term dividend growth and a leader in financial strength and cash flow,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` We believe we have established a superior record in all these respects, even in poor years. We have every reason to believe that our future record will be even better.'' <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> had sales of $ 1.6 billion last year and net income of $ 36.2 million, or $ 2.06 a share. In the first quarter of this year, <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> reported sales of $ 504.2 million and net income of $ 29.8 million, or $ 1.65 per share. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, 58, son of the company's founder, is a bearded, balding cannonball of a man, wears a tan uniform on the job, the same type of clothing worn by his workers. The company's orange and yellow logo is on the uniform, along with his name. `` If we had suits on, we might not go out in the chicken house or the feed mill or the processing plant,'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a 1985 interview. Forbes magazine this week listed <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> as the 245th wealthiest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resident, with an estimated net worth of $ 330 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to plead guilty to fraud charges brought after a federal investigation revealed the company had been overbilling the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for airplane parts, authorities said today. <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to pay a $ 115 million settlement, the largest single fraud settlement in history, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` What you have, in a sense, is a tragedy,'' <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. `` You have a company that set out to defraud the government. `` The only way that type of activity can be deterred is through swift legal action,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernam </PERSON> was not immediately available for comment, said a secretary in his <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION> office who would identify herself only as <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>. Rockford-based <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> makes flight-data equipment, engine startup systems and other electronic equipment for military and commercial aircraft. The Pentagon accounts for 42 percent of the company's $ 1.4 billion in annual sales. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> would not comment on a published report that the aerospace contractor could be suspended for a time from doing business with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The company agreed to plead guilty to a four-count criminal information that accused Sundstrand of overcharging the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> from 1981 through 1985 and concealing millions of dollars in cost overruns on design-and-development contracts, officials said. The company also was accused of conspiring to undermine the contract-bidding process by spending more than $ 100,000 to provide <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> personnel with liquor, meals, theater tickets and other amenities in a bid to gain greater access to them. `` <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> has provided a good-quality product for a long period of time. Unfortunately, we've been paying too much for it,'' <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, regional commander of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said at the news conference. In its annual filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> said the `` government has advised that it intends to charge the company with criminal violations'' in <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sunstrand </ORGANIZATION> operates a subsidiary, part of its <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Redmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing said the company was `` in the process of entering a settlement in one or possibly both actions.'' It added that settlements `` could result in the imposition of materially adverse fines and penalties.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> reported in a 1987 financial filing that the government was seeking repayment of $ 13.5 million plus interest and $ 102.9 million plus interest in two separate disputes over contract pricing. The company began putting money in reserve two years ago to cover settlement and legal expenses resulting from the dispute. Business Week reported last month that <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> could face possible suspension by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stock exchange finished a jittery session sharply lower Wednesday, pulled down by sinking prices on Wall Street. The markets were battered by rumors that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for August, due j5w Thursday, could show a significant widening in the country's trade gap. The <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index fell 24 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,814.3, near its worst level for the session of 1,811.8. The index opened at its highest point, down 7.1 points. Volume was modest, as 475.9 million shares changed hands, compared with the 462.9 million shares traded Tuesday. Dealers said the market came unglued by Wall Street's overall decline, with the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average dropping as much as 25 points within the first 15 minutes of trading. By the close of trading in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the average was 30.23 points lower at 2,126.24. Attention focused squarely on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures, which are expected to show a widening of the trade deficit in August to $ 11.3 billion from July's $ 9.5 billion, according to several economists. But market watchers suggested that the shortfall could surge to as much as $ 15 billion.

<HEAD>Walgreen Announces Haft Family Purchase Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Walgreen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said today the <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> family, which already has a bid outstanding for supermarket owner <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is seeking federal permission to acquire at least $ 15 million of the drug retailer's stock. <ORGANIZATION> Walgreen </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest drugstore chain, also reported a 22 percent increase in its fourth-quarter net income and a 25 percent profit gain for the 1988 fiscal year. The <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> applied for federal clearance to purchase the <ORGANIZATION> Walgreen </ORGANIZATION> stock, the retailer said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Walgreen </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said it did not know how much, if any, <ORGANIZATION> Walgreen </ORGANIZATION> stock the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> already own. `` We will monitor the <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> situation carefully and take all actions necessary to protect the company and its shareholders,'' said Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walgreen </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Neither the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> nor their company, <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, would comment today on any plans regarding <ORGANIZATION> Walgreen </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Walgreen </ORGANIZATION> stock rose $ 1.37 -LCB- a share to $ 34 in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading after today's announcement. The Hafts, based in <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, sold <PERSON> Dart </PERSON>'s discount drugstore chain in 1984. Since then, the family has said they want to acquire and operate another retailing company, but they have a string of unsuccessful takeover bids behind them that have cast doubt on their sincerity. Last month, <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> chairman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> and his son, company president <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Haft </PERSON>, offered to buy <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> for $ 55 a share, or a total of about $ 4.32 billion. The status of the bid was in doubt after the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> withdrew a $ 5.03 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> offered last week to help <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> fight the <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION> bid by proposing to provide additional equity for <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s previously-announced restructuring <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> reiterated Tuesday the family `` remains interested in working with <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> to strengthen the company and enhance their restructuring by providing additional equity.'' He declined to comment on whether the <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> offer for <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> was withdrawn. The Hafts have bid unsuccessfully in the past for retailers including <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Supermarkets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. However, they have made millions of dollars in profits from the sale of their stock in their targets, and have been labeled corporate raiders in the process. In its earnings report today, <ORGANIZATION> Walgreen </ORGANIZATION> said it had net income of $ 31.9 million, or 52 cents a share for the three months ending Aug. 31, compared with $ 26.2 million, or 42 cents a share, for the fourth quarter a year ago. Sales during the period increased to $ 1.2 billion from $ 1.1 billion. For the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, <ORGANIZATION> Walgreen </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 129.1 million, or $ 2.10 a share, compared with $ 103.5 million, or $ 1.68 a share, in fiscal 1987. Sales in fiscal 1988 totaled $ 4.9 billion, up from $ 4.3 billion in fiscal 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Walgreen </ORGANIZATION> has 1,400 <ORGANIZATION> Walgreen </ORGANIZATION>'s drugstores in 29 states.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it has resumed an inquiry into alleged anticompetitive practices in the spare parts market by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s British subsidiary and other car makers based on a court ruling last week. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> said two car makers, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s AB Volvo of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, could refuse licenses to spare parts makers if they did not abuse this power of refusal. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said its probe must show if <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and others, which it did not name, engaged in `` abusive practices'' violating <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> antitrust rules. The court said illegal practices included arbitrary refusal to supply spare parts, charging unfair prices or not making parts for models that were still on the road in large numbers. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s inquiry was begun several years ago following complaints by independent spare parts makers that car makers used their copyright and design rights to prevent them from making and selling components. The Commission threatened to sue <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.K. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 after a complaint by British spare parts makers but suspended its action when <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> agreed to change some of its practices. Investigation of the substance of the complaint against <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> is continuing, the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Survey Shows Lower Expectations By Plant Managers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Plant managers' expectations for increased orders and overall demand in the current quarter declined for the second period in a row, but their longer-term outlook remains strong, a survey showed Wednesday. The quarterly plant-managers survey done by <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> showed modest declines in the key indexes of expected production, new orders and demand for the last three months of the year. Similar declines were reported in the survey about expectations for the June-September quarter. But for the next 12 months, the survey showed, plant managers believe production, new orders and overall demand will sustain their underlying strength, although many respondents are worried about inflation. `` The bottom line is that expectations have moderated to more sustainable levels after a dramatic surge earlier this year,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate economist and chief statistician. The survey asks 1,500 manufacturing plant managers about their views on existing and expected conditions in their factories, including production levels, new orders, costs and prices, as well as their perception of overall demand in their industry. <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> is the world's leading marketer of business information and related services, with worldwide revenue of $ 3.4 billion in 1987.

<TEXT>
 A $ 17 million wrongful death suit filed by a cancer victim's family against the maker of Pall Mall cigarettes probably wo n't be scheduled for retrial until next spring at the earliest, the plaintiffs' attorney predicts. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> of <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> probably will st the second trial date soon _ now that the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has refused to rule on issues in the case before it is heard by a second jury, attorney <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Wednesday from his <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> represents the family of now-deceased <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> of <PERSON> Durant </PERSON> in a case against <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the maker of Pall Malls, and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Candy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, a local cigarette distributor. The first <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trial in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, which attracted dozens of Wall Street analysts and national news media, ended Jan. 29 in a hung jury. `` We hope it's real soon,'' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said of the second trial date. `` We've had a problem of course with the death of one of our circuit judges, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, so Judge <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> is really snowed under and the <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> family understands that. But we believe he'll give us a setting as soon as his schedule will permit. National anti-smoking advocates had hailed the first <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> trial as a chance to ruin cigarette manufacturers' long string of victories in cases seeking damages for cancer victims who smoke. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> died of cancer on Jan. 26, 1987, and his family contends the two packs of Pall Mall cigarettes he smoked each day for 35 years caused his death. Since the hung jury in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, a federal court jury in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> held a cigarette company partially responsible for the 1984 death of <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> and awarded $ 400,000 in damages to her widower, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> case `` may be psychologically important'' in the <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> retrial. However, he added, `` We're going to win our case on the evidence we present.'' Attorneys for the tobacco company have repeatedly said they wo n't comment on any aspect of the pending case. The <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, without a written opinion, refused on Sept. 21 to hear an appeal filed by <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>'s family. The plaintiffs had wanted the high court to rule on 15 legal issues in the case before it went to a second trial. One of the main issues the high court was asked to determine is whether the <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> family can introduce evidence of advertising they contend might have encouraged <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>'s smoking habit. Defense attorneys wanted the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to decide whether federal tobacco labeling laws warning of health risks would make the advertising arguments moot. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>'s family counters that he began smoking the cigarettes in 1955, 10 years before the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Surgeon General required a warning label on cigarette packages. However, they say the cigarette maker knew then that its product was harmful and addictive.

<HEAD>Georgia Pacific's Third-Quarter Earnings Down Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading maker of plywood and other forest products, announced a small decline in third-quarter earnings Wednesday because of weak prices and higher interest costs from a stock-buyback program. Earnings for the three months ended Sept. 30 totaled $ 114 million vs. $ 118 million a year earlier. Earnings per share, however, totaled $ 1.19 vs. $ 1.10, the Atlanta-based company said. The rise in earnings per share was due to the smaller number of shares outstanding from the stock buyback, which left the total number outstanding at 95.32 million in the latest quarter vs. 107.56 million a year earlier. Sales for the latest quarter totaled $ 2.4 billion, down marginally from the $ 2.42 billion a year earlier. <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said the company's overall business was sound, reflecting healthy demand for pulp and paper products, but he said earnings were affected by weak plywood and lumber prices. He also attributed the lower third-quarter earnings to `` higher interest costs associated with debt incured to finance our share repurchase program and acquisitions.'' For the first nine months of the year, earnings totaled $ 338 million, down 2.3 percent from the $ 346 million earned in the comparable year-earlier period. Per-share earnings totaled $ 3.41 vs. $ 3.16, which the company attributed to the lower number of shares outstanding. Nine-month sales totaled $ 6.94 billion, up 9 percent from $ 6.37 billion in the year-earlier period.

But little change was expected in the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s September corn production estimate of 4.46 billion bushels. The report, issued shortly after the close, pegged soybean production at 1.5 billion bushels and corn production at 4.55 billion bushels.

<HEAD>Whirlpool Third Quarter Earnings Down 29.3 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTON HARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Appliance maker <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 29.4 percent drop in third quarter earnings Wednesday, primarily because of the higher costs of materials. The company said it earned $ 31.5 million, or 45 cents per share, on sales of $ 1.2 billion in the July-September period this year, compared with $ 44.6 million, or 63 cents per share, on $ 1.1 billion in sales during the same three months last year. The third-quarter sales, up 5.4 percent from the third quarter of 1987, set a company record, and were attributed to increases in shipments of <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> KitchenAid </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Kenmore </LOCATION> products. During the third quarter of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> announced some price increases and acquired <ORGANIZATION> Emerson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s dishwasher and trash compactor manufacturing business. For the first nine months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 106.1 million, or $ 1.53 per share, on sales of $ 3.4 billion. During the July-September period last year, the company earned $ 151.5 million, or $ 2.09 a share, on sales of $ 3.2 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> said the drop in third quarter earnings and the 30 percent decline so far this year was due largely to higher material prices not covered by price increases. A weak kitchen-cabinet business and a $ 10.8 million addition to the 1987 figures because of an accounting change also played roles in the earnings weakness this year, the company said.

<HEAD>World Oil Glut Prompts Budget Cuts in Mexico</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The plunge in prices for oil, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s leading export, has prompted the government to announce painful budget cuts, consider an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> contingency loan and renew calls for a better deal on the foreign debt It also highlights a stubborn battle against inflation and an ambitious trade liberalization program meant to diversify <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s export earnings and wean the nation from dependence on oil-generated revenues <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>, the government oil monopoly, said on Oct. 7 that average spot market prices for Mexican crude had sunk to about $ 9 a barrel and that revenues for this year would fall below 1987's $ 8.6 billion. Last year, oil accounted for 41 percent of total Mexican export revenues and helped the country post an overall $ 8.4 billion trade surplus. Reacting to the drop in oil-based earnings _ estimated by one <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official at $ 2 billion below official projections so far this year _ President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s administration announced more than $ 200 million in budget cuts last Friday. The administration took pains to assure Mexicans, whose paychecks are worth half what they were in 1982, that the cuts would spare social programs. `` We can manage the problems -LRB- caused by falling oil prices -RRB- with some sacrifices,'' <PERSON> Agustin </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Legorreta </PERSON>, president of the private <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. The falling price of oil has spurred new calls for renegotiation of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s $ 104 billion foreign debt. <PERSON> Legorreta </PERSON> said interest payments on the debt are sucking funds away from economic development. The government has been using its foreign reserves to support a 7-month-old peso currency exchange rate freeze as part of an anti-inflation wage and price stabilization program. If the price of oil keeps dropping, however, the government may actually be forced to add to the debt burden. Most analysts believe the government when it says inflation is its No. 1 economic priority and say President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> will try to maintain the fight. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> takes office Dec. 1. `` The danger of hyperinflation is so big that the effort should continue,'' said <PERSON> Jacobo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaidenweber </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mexico-United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, in a recent interview. `` It could take between one and three years in one form or another.'' Under terms of a 1987 foreign debt rescheduling agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has the option to draw up to $ 1.2 billion in contingency loans if the price of crude oil drops below the $ 9 barrier. Hard currecny reserves, which reached a high of $ 16 billion in April, dropped to an estimated $ 12 billion in July as the government propped up the peso against the dollar. The government has resisted fresh calls to devalue and give Mexican entrepreneurs a new export advantage that could help offset the shrinking trade surplus. A devaluation would generate new inflationary pressures; the anti-inflation plan has, officially, reduced annualized inflation from a record 159.2 percent in 1987 to about 45 percent this year. Although resisting the calls to devalue, the administration has stressed the importance of non-oil exports to make up for the shortfall in oil revenues. Through June, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s first-half merchandise trade surplus totalled $ 2.4 billion, well below 1987's first-half surplus of $ 4.76 billion, according to the Center for Private Sector Economic Studies. But non-petroleum exports, at $ 7.1 billion, were up 20 percent over the same period in 1987. However, the surplus was hurt when merchandise imports surged by 53 percent between January and June to $ 8.3 billion. That was encouraged by trade liberalization aimed at forcing domestic industry to become competitive and lower prices. On Monday, <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, director general of <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petrochemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, reiterated the government's position that manufacturers' exports are the best way to compensate for the weak oil sector.

 Credit comes for the Latin word for `` believe.'' One year ago, as the stock market went down in flames, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s lenders almost stopped believing The credit crisis that nearly imposed gridlock on the financial system is one of the least understood yet most important aspects of last October's historic plunge. In human terms, the crisis sprang from a loss of faith that participants in the market would honor their commitments. Markets are founded on that belief and can not function without it. The stock market depends on the banking system because every trade involves money passing from a seller's bank to a buyer's. Banks also provide lines of credit for investors. Instead of making fresh loans during the crash, some big <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> banks actually demanded more collateral on existing loans from desperate customers that had to meet margin calls. Only decisive action by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> prevented the banks' response from triggering a wave of defaults that could have ushered in a full-fledged panic A year later, in spite of numerous studies, little has been done to rebuild the financial system so the next stock market collapse does not bring the circulation of money to a deadly standstill. `` All financial panics result from the withdrawal of credit by the banks. It's the grease in the engine, and the engine seizes up without it,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, a veteran banking writer. The survival of the markets through Black Monday proved the financial system can withstand a major shock, but a bit of luck was involved. If the crash had occurred one week earlier, banks and the money transfer wires would have been closed for Columbus Day. Traders would have piled up huge debts with no way to pay them. `` It would have been horrendous. The system would not have worked. It would have stopped,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a partner in the consulting firm of <ORGANIZATION> McKinsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. To a degree, the banks' caution on lending last year is understandable: Banks have a duty to both federal regulators and their own shareholders not to throw money away on loans that will not be repaid Complicating credit decisions last year were deficiencies in the back offices _ the operations that work out who owes what to whom and then carry out deliveries of securities and payments for them. These back offices, known as clearing and settlement systems, have grown haphazardly into a disjointed network that is unsuited for a world of global trading and tightly interconnected markets. A clearing and settlement network consists of organizations that help stock exchanges sort out the terms of a trade and then make the swap by taking in the securities from the seller and the payment from the buyer. If one side or the other defaults, the system is supposed to make good on the deal. In spite of safeguards, some regulators feared last October that a single default in the back offices could have set off a chain reaction of defaults. The worriers included <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON>, who many regard as a hero of the crash because he oversaw the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s emergency lending and arm-twisted bankers into supplying credit to financial institutions The possibility of a major default in one of the clearing and settlement systems was `` the greatest threat to the stability of the financial system as a whole in that period,'' <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON> said last May. Most proposed reforms have dealt with highly visible matters _ an express lane for individual investors, coordinated circuit breakers for stocks and futures. Far less attention has been paid to clearing and settlement, the invisible side of the financial system. `` It's not a subject that people have considered sexy. It is sexy. You're talking about well over a trillion dollars a day,'' said <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, the banking writer and author of a new book, `` Markets.'' Each of the major exchanges has its own system for clearing and settling, and each system has different rules. The fragmentation was acceptable when <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> stuck to beans and bellies, but it does not work in the era of index arbitrage, when traders simultaneously do business in multiple markets. Delays in settlement keep traders guessing about whether their sales and purchases will actually go through. It takes five days to be paid for stocks sold on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Some foreign exchanges take months. Changes are coming, but slowly. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> says it will not reduce the lag in payment and delivery from five days until sometime in the next decade. The irony is that settlement problems could push a customer into default even if it had plenty of money coming to it, a point made by the presidential task force in its post mortem on the crash. The fragility of the settlement system is worsened by a practice known as `` daylight overdrafting,'' in which banks cash checks for big customers or other banks before the money to cover the checks has arrived. These overdrafts are huge, a fact that becomes apparent only when something goes wrong. In November 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> had to take out an emergency overnight loan of $ 26 billion from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> because of a computer bug. `` The real issue is, what you've got is risk piled on top of risk,'' said McKinsey's <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. Global trading is exacerbating the problem. Big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks routinely shut down for the night with giant holes in their books because they have not received money from abroad to cover overdrafts. Theoretically, a major default overseas could knock out a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank while all its officers were asleep. Although the 1987 stock market crash began in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the next one could well start in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Or a big institution could fail for reasons unrelated to a stock crash _ as <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> nearly did in 1984. Americans say the European clearing and settlement systems are one place trouble could start. The two biggest European systems handle a combined $ 90 billion a week but, unlike their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterparts, do n't guarantee that the parties to a trade will fulfill their obligations. `` There are few institutions that seem to monitor and are fully aware of that type of risk,'' said <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulkowitz </PERSON>, senior vice president for credit policy at <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is cutting back on the size of overdrafts banks are allowed to make. But since global markets are here to stay, the long-term solution is for banks to stay open around the clock. In the end, there is a danger that the market's survival through Black Monday will create a false sense of security, leading bankers, brokers and traders to believe that reforms are not needed because the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will always be there to bail the system out.

<TEXT>
 Here are some changes in the clearing and settlement system that would reduce the likelihood that another stock market crash will send the financial system into gridlock: SPEED UP SETTLEMENTS. Delayed settlements tie up money and keep traders exposed to risks. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> has said it recognizes the problem and will move by 1990 to two-day clearing _ that is, straightening out who owes what to whom. However, settlement will continue to take places five days after trading until sometime later in the 1990s. KEEP BANKS OPEN. Banks need to move to around-the-clock operations so they can meet the needs of financial institutions that do business at all hours. This will reduce risks and keep banking business from moving to foreign banks. REDUCE OVERDRAFTS. Customers should have to pay for the privilege of getting cash from a bank before the money to cover the withdrawal has been deposited. This should discourage overdrafts and reduce the vulnerability of banks to defaults. UPDATE LAWS. Revise the federal bankruptcy code and other laws so they treat stocks, futures and options more consistently. For example, banks should have clear rights to obtain liens on put options that are pledged as collateral. PERMIT CROSS-MARGINING. With changes in laws, exchanges would be freer to allow traders to pledge assets in one market as collateral against liabilities in another _ for example, put options against stocks. This would help traders with hedged positions and ease the selling pressure in a falling market. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clearing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plan to allow cross-margining next year. IMPROVE EQUIPMENT. Make sure computers and communication systems are secure and have back-ups. Many observers feel the sense of panic on Oct. 20 was heightened when the Fedwire, which handles money transfers between banks, briefly failed. LOOK OVERSEAS. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities should take the lead in improving the security and efficiency of foreign clearing and settlement systems. In today's interlocked markets, a major default in a system overseas would quickly affect the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, on Wednesday criticized a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report that said the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> did not fully investigate as many as 80 percent of job discrimination claims over a three-month period last year. In a statement, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the report by <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, an investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, `` trivializes civil rights enforcement to a level commensurate with widget making. It's politically motivated, highly misleading and deficient in several major regards.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> criticized the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report for failing to note improvements in <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION>'s program and its successes in civil rights enforcement; conducting a limited, overly mechanical study that ignored the complexities of civil rights enforcement; and recommending old ideas for improvement and disregarding initiatives implemented by <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION>'s recent unprecedented success in comparison to the agency's past record was virtually ignored by <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> in this report,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. `` We have investigated more charges, filed more lawsuits and obtained more tangible benefits for victims of unlawful discrimination than any previous commission.'' He said the report's `` inaccurate and misleading findings impugn the reputations of many career civil servants and undermine the progress we have made as a civil rights enforcement agency. `` We have buttressed our strengths,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` We have acknowledged our weaknesses and taken steps to correct them. Our program is working.'' In its report, released Tuesday by Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the stated policy of <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> since 1983 has been to `` fully investigate'' charges of violation of federal, state and local anti-employment discrimination laws <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> reviewed investigations of charges closed between January through March 1987 in which no evidence of discrimination was found. The investigators said 41 percent to 82 percent of the charges closed by the six <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> district offices and 40 percent to 87 percent of charges closed by five state agencies were not fully investigated. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, who asked for the study, said: `` I find it outrageous that there are people across the country who may have a legitimate job discrimination claim denied because the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> mishandled the case, did n't enforce the law and was more concerned with reducing paperwork than with protecting claimants' civil rights.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged it has a lack of expertise in evaluating evidence to determine whether discrimination had occurred. `` <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> has a fundamental lack of understanding of the investigatory and judicial principles of witness credibility, evidence and burdens of proof inherent in civil rights enforcement,'' he said. `` <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> refused to seek clarification of the evaluation standards used by <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> and ignored our attempts to define those standards. `` A full investigation is that amount of investigation required to make a sound determination on the merits of the charge,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. `` It is nothing more and nothing less.''

<HEAD>Bank Of England Scales Down Size Of British Banknotes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tourists will find it easier to tuck British banknotes into their wallets in a few years as the present series of large, unwieldy bills is replaced by smaller currency, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday. `` <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> banknotes are quite, quite large internationally,'' said a spokesman for <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s central bank, requesting anonymity. `` There seems some logic in reducing their size so people can fit them into their wallets.'' The bank's D-series notes, introduced in 1970, will be phased out in gradual stages beginning with the introduction of a new E-series 5-pound bill in 1990, which is the equivalent of $ 8.50, and continuing with new 10-pound, 20-pound, and 50-pound bills through 1994, the spokesman said. They are the equivalent of $ 17, $ 34 and $ 85 respectively. The D-series notes will remain legal tender. Unlike the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> notes are a uniform size and color, British banknotes come in various dimensions and hues. The blue 5-pound note, slightly larger than a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar bill, is dwarfed by the greenish 50-pound note, nearly the size of a page from a paperback novel. The average reduction will be about 0.5 inches -LRB- or 1.27 centimeters -RRB- in length and width. The bills will remain different sizes to help blind people distinguish between them, the spokesman said. Britons carry more of the high-denomination notes than they used to, the spokesman said. The most popular is the pink 10-pound note, with 610 million in circulation. The Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> will save `` substantial'' paper costs by reducing the size of the notes and producing them with advanced printing technology, the spokesman said. Though final designs remain to be worked out, all the bills will continue to feature a portrait of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on the front and a historical figure on the reverse, the spokesman said. The reductions in size for each bill are: Five-pound note, from 3 inches by 5.7 inches to 2.7 by 5.3 inches; 10-pound note, 3.34 inches by 5.94 inches to 2.95 inches by 5.6 inches; 20-pound note, 3.5 inches by 6.3 inches to 3.14 inches by 5.86 inches; and 50-pound note, 3.7 inches by 6.65 inches to 3.34 inches by 6.14 inches.

<HEAD>Some Kroger Employees Fear Another Takeover Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> employees are concerned that another takeover attempt might be looming, even though a big investment firm has withdrawn its $ 5.03 billion buyout bid and the giant supermarket chain has undertaken a major defensive restructuring. Employees at <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> headquarters say they are relieved <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which specializes in corporate takeovers, withdrew its $ 64-per-share buyout offer on Tuesday. But concern about <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> and their jobs remains. `` I think we are going to make it, but it will still be tough,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Aulick </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s management information systems department. <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, began the bidding for <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 19 with a $ 4.32 billion, $ 55-per-share offer. <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> has not improved its offer but has not indicated whether it too was withdrawing from the scene. To thwart both buyout offers, <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> has undertaken a $ 4.6 billion corporate restructuring that includes the sale of some of the company's stores and food processing businesses. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> dismissed 300 of its approximately 800 headquarters employees as part of the restructuring, in order to save $ 13 million annually. <PERSON> Aulick </PERSON> said he believes attempts to acquire the company will end because <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> was unsuccessful in its bid for <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> after a three-week effort. He noted that <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price fell after <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> withdrew, reflecting speculation that there would be no further buyout offers that might drive the price higher. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s stock fell $ 2.62 -LCB- a share to $ 55 in heavy trading Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, but closed $ 1 higher at $ 56 on Wednesday. But Kroger headquarters employee <ORGANIZATION> Bruce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said he thinks another buyout attempt probably is looming. `` I think attempts to take over the company will continue. The climate is ripe for them now and <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> is a solid company, which makes it attractive,'' House said. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> officials say the restructuring _ which will result in a smaller and more indebted company _ is a better deal for shareholders than the <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> offer. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> shareholders will get a $ 40 a share special cash dividend, plus notes and stock in the restructured company. A few <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> employees were surprised, but not disappointed, by <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON>'s decision to withdraw. `` I was happy but caught off guard,'' employee <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Wurtzler </PERSON> said. `` We thought it was good the company's -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- plan seems to have worked.'' Company employees said they have not heard whether more firings were planned. The remaining employees are concerned about their futures. `` I have mixed emotions about everything,'' House said. `` It's been so rough the last two weeks. After last week's firings, which many employees blamed on <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover attempt, there were few kind words for the buyout specialists. `` They made their money, they stripped the company, they did their damage, and now they're gone,'' <PERSON> Aulick </PERSON> said. `` I'm glad they're gone. We're going to make it.'' The 105-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> has about 170,000 employees and 52,000 shareholders. The company's main businesses are its supermarkets and convenience stores, with operations in 29 states. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it has received <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> approval to sell 24 <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choice </ORGANIZATION> supermarkets and 24 <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choice </ORGANIZATION> liquor stores, all located in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, to the <ORGANIZATION> Kash </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> N </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Karry </ORGANIZATION> firm for $ 55 million.

 The dollar fell to its lowest point since the early summer on Wednesday, continuing a swift descent that was blamed on nervousness about Thursday's report on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. Meanwhile, gold prices were mostly higher. A big deficit would indicate that the dollar needs to fall further to erase the trade deficit by making <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods cheaper in world markets. Since its latest peak on Sept. 1, the dollar has fallen 6 percent against the Japanese yen, 4 percent against the British pound and more than 3 percent against the West German mark. The steepest slide has occurred this week. `` This is the first time in a long time that I've sensed the currency markets to be as nervous as they have been in the last 48 hours,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. Some traders said the dollar might fall if the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported an August trade deficit greater than $ 11 billion or so, compared to $ 9.5 billion in July. However, the market's reaction to trade numbers is unpredictable. If sentiment has shifted decisively against the dollar, even a small deficit could fail to boost the currency. `` It appears there had been a consensus in the market that the dollar fundamentally should drop,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` There's a sense developing that we're getting to the end of the line'' on monthly improvements in the trade deficit, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, a currency analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The dollar began to ease in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, following Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON>'s indications that he is n't too concerned about the Japanese yen's recent strength. <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON>'s statements, some <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> dealers said, triggered sales of billions of dollars by institutions in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to a closing 129.65 yen from 131.15 yen late Tuesday. It was the first time the dollar closed below the 130-yen level since June 24. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 129.20 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar plunged to 129.03 yen from 131.07 late Tuesday, reaching its lowest point since June 23, when it closed at 128.55. Market participants said the Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, repeating Tuesday's move, came into the market Wednesday, selling modest amounts of sterling when the currency traded at about $ 1.7270. But the intervention failed to stem the dollar's fall and the pound's rise At the end of the day, it cost $ 1.7305 to buy one pound, more expensive than $ 1.7175 late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound rose to $ 1.7364 from $ 1.7172. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.8345 West German marks, down from 1.8541; 1.5491 Swiss francs, down from 1.5615; 1.2112 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2111; 6.2545 French francs, down from 6.3165; and 1,366.63 Italian lire, down from 1,380.75. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.8340 West German marks, down from 1.8512; 1.55865 Swiss francs, down from 1.5690; 6.2770 French francs, down from 6.3070; 2.0760 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0850; 1,370.50 Italian lire, down from 1,379.00; and 1.21175 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2075 Gold prices were mostly higher. The exception was <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, where gold prices fell $ 3.06 a troy ounce to close at a bid $ 408.53, after rising on Tuesday. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 409.25 a troy ounce, compared with late Tuesday's $ 406.25 an ounce. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold rose to a bid of $ 408.10 an ounce compared with $ 406.00 late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 408.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 404 late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Holly Farms Will Study Tyson's Takeover Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it will consider the nearly $ 900 million takeover offer from rival poultry processor <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, the nation's largest poultry processor, offered late Tuesday to pay $ 45 in cash and a quarter share of its Class A common stock for each of <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>' 18.1 million outstanding shares In a brief statement Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> said its board of directors would study the offer. The company declined to offer any other comment. `` I think <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> will sell to <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> only as a last resort,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillin </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, an associate analyst at the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keegan </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, predicted a deal would be worked out between the two poultry rivals. <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> stock rose sharply in heavy trading, jumping $ 6.62 -LCB- a share to $ 49.62 -LCB- in composite <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> fell 62 -LCB- cents a share to $ 17 in over-the-counter trading. <PERSON> McMillin </PERSON> said he estimated <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> was worth at least $ 55 a share, or about $ 6 a share higher than <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> offered. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> put <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>' value at between $ 50 and $ 55 a share. <PERSON> McMillin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>' managers could seek a higher bid from a third party but he speculated they might try to buy the company themselves in a leveraged buyout. A leveraged buyout is financed with debt that is repaid with the target company's cash flow or sale of assets. `` There's a couple of options,'' <PERSON> McMillin </PERSON> said. `` One is to look for a white knight, which could potentially be a <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> or a <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> ... look for a company to basically choose who they want to get married to. `` The other is to pursue a management-led leveraged buyout, take the company private. I think that's what they're pursuing right now,'' he said. Several hours before <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> disclosed its offer, <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> had announced it had been approached by an unidentified company regarding a possible business combination. <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Farms </PERSON> said no specific proposal had been received and the company did not intend to seek one. The company also said it had activated its `` poison pill'' takeover defense, which is designed to make a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Justice </PERSON>, a spokesman at <LOCATION> Tyson </LOCATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Springdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, said Wednesday that <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> had not heard from <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> about the offer. `` We are just waiting on whatever decision they are making over there. We are standing by,'' he said. `` We do have a timetable of Oct. 19. That's our deadline. Hopefully, they can make a decision prior to that. And we feel optimistic about a response before that.'' <PERSON> McMillin </PERSON> said a merger would increase <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s share of the national poultry market from 18 percent to 28 percent. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> produces 14 million pounds of chicken meat each week from an operation that includes hatcheries, feed mills, processing plants and a sophisticated marketing arm. The company sells both whole chickens and processed products to supermarkets, fast food chains and institutional customers. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> had revenues of about $ 1.8 billion in its most recent fiscal year, with an after-tax profit of $ 67 million. It has 25,600 employees. <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Farms </PERSON> is a diversified foods company, with about 50 percent of its sales concentrated in chicken. The company also mills flour and provides other meats for the food service industry. <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> had sales of $ 1.6 billion last year and net income of $ 36.2 million.

<HEAD>Gold Prices Rebound But Experts Still Expect Sharp Drop</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Retransmitting with correct header</NOTE>

<TEXT>
 Precious metals futures prices rebounded Wednesday in response to weaker bond prices and a softer dollar but analysts continued to predict that gold would soon return to its recent lows below $ 400 a troy ounce. On other markets, energy futures rallied sharply; livestock and meat gained; grains and soybeans were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated. Gold for October delivery traded as high as $ 409 a troy ounce on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and December gold hit $ 416 as traders interpreted lower bond prices and the weaker dollar as bullish signals for the precious metals. But to chart-watching technical traders, those gold prices _ the highest in three weeks _ meant the market was overbought. The technicians sold, driving the December contract down to a close of $ 412.20, although the spot contract held up well, settling at $ 408.40. Analyst <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Josephthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the bond and dollar weakness that precipitated Wednesday's gold rush was largely based on expectations that the government would report a widening of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit in a report due out Thursday morning. Meanwhile, he said, the low inflation rate, ample gold supplies and other factors that led to the gold market's collapse last month remain in place. `` I think the market is in an overbought condition and I think we'll test the recent lows of $ 390 to $ 395'' in the December contract, <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON> said. Gold settled $ 3.80 to $ 4.70 higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 412.20 a troy ounce; silver was 11.9 cents to 12 cents higher with December at $ 6.395 a troy ounce. Energy futures prices galloped higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, paced by unleaded gasoline, which surged the 2-cents-a-gallon daily limit before late profit-taking reduced the gains. Crude oil settled above $ 14 a barrel for the first time in two weeks. The rally reflected `` a general mood of reassessment'' about the ability of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> to curb their crude oil production and boost prices, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON> said the oil rally was linked to growing signs that the cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> would develop into a lasting peace West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 33 cents to 56 cents higher with November at $ 14.11 a barrel; heating oil was 1.01 cents to 1.76 cents higher with November at 40.84 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.40 cents to 1.95 cents higher with November at 42.66 cents a gallon. Cattle futures posted strong gains due to higher cash markets and indications of firmer demand for beef at the wholesale and retail levels, analysts said. Pork futures gained on spillover buying from the cattle pits. Live cattle settled .25 cent to 1.02 cents higher with October at 72.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .73 cent higher with October at 81.75 cents a pound; hogs were .22 cent lower to .30 cent higher with October at 40.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to .17 cent higher with February at 48.05 cents a pound. Grain futures finished mostly higher while soybeans ended mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in light, cautious trading ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s revised crop production report. The report, issued shortly after the close, pegged soybean production at 1.5 billion bushels and corn production at 4.55 billion bushels. Both of those estimates were higher than the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s September projections, reflecting better-than-expected yields from the ongoing harvest. The numbers indicated that drought damage would result in a 35 percent reduction in the corn crop from last year's 7.1 billion bushels and a 21 percent drop in soybean production from last year's 1.9 billion bushels. Analysts and traders said the report was slightly bearish for grain and soybean prices but they did not expect a major sell-off. `` I would n't be surprised if it ticks down and goes right back up,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. Wheat settled \ cent lower to 2 cents higher with December at $ 4.34 -RCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.96 \ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with December at $ 2.56 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 \ cents lower to 1 cent higher with November at $ 7.90 \ Stock-index futures fell sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for December delivery of stocks on the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 3.94 points lower at 273.99.

<TEXT>
 Personal computer industry pioneer <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jobs </PERSON> unveiled his Next computer workstation, calling it a `` university on a desktop'' during a glitzy product demonstration on Wednesday that rivaled a Hollywood premier. `` This will serve not only as the latest state-of-the-art technological tool, but as a partner in thought,'' Jobs told 3,000 people gathered at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s posh <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> Symphony Hall. `` Its performance is staggering,'' the 33-year-old co-founder of <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said as students, industry executives and potential software contributors wildly cheered. Jobs founded <ORGANIZATION> Next </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 after leaving Apple in a power struggle with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sculley </PERSON>, the chairman and chief executive officer. Jobs, a college dropout, said his long-awaited computer would be available to universities by April of next year at a price around $ 6,500, about twice early estimates. It eventually will sell for commercial use at about $ 10,000, but Jobs would not say when it would be made available to the general public. A special laser printer, featuring the highest resolution capabilities in the industry, will be sold along with the Next for $ 2,000. `` This is going to be the biggest little computer in the world,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, an independent <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, software specialist. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsop </PERSON>, the influential publisher of the P.C. Newsletter, called the machine a `` landmark computer.'' `` Over time, it will change the way people look at computers ... that's the innovation here, that's what all the hype is about,'' <PERSON> Alsop </PERSON> said after the presentation. But <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, has derided the Next, saying it represents little in the way of innovation. `` What's novel about it? Is it as much of an advance as the Mac -LRB- Apple Macintosh -RRB- was with its graphics interface? Is it marketed to a broad enough part of the market?'' he asked, implying it was neither. One thing it lacks is a color monitor, although <PERSON> Jobs </PERSON> said one would be available in about a year. To those in attendance at the demonstration, the software was the biggest innovation. Using its own distinctive set of symbols, the Next is easy to program, allowing college professors, for example, to design illustrations of complex scientific principles according to their own needs. The Next uses a simplified version of Unix, the standard operating system for advanced workstations. Among other things, it allowed Jobs during Wednesday's demonstration to recreate the sounds of a thunderstorm; <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s `` I Had a Dream'' speech; and a speech from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, all computer-generated In an agreement also announced Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has licensed the right to use the symbols and commands developed by Next and probably will use the technology on <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> computers that run Unix. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said last month that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 10 million for the license. The agreement with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> will solve one of Jobs' biggest problems, getting software writers to convert programs to a single system. This way they will be able to make sales to users of both Next and <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> computers. Although the Next initially will be available only to universities, analysts expect Jobs to aggressively move into other markets within a few years. `` He's seeding for the future,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lupatkin </PERSON>, senior technology analyst at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hambrecht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There was a lot of hype and anticipation about this thing ... and Jobs has lived up to all those expectations,'' <PERSON> Lupatkin </PERSON> added. One of the biggest innovations in hardware was a robot-built streamlined printed circuit board only 1-foot square that <PERSON> Jobs </PERSON> said packs enough power and speed to approach mainframe computer capabilites. He called it the world's most compact circuit board, a device which runs any computer. Each board is built in 20 minutes at a factory in <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION>, some by robots with vision and others that can place up to 150 parts per minutes, <PERSON> Jobs </PERSON> said. The Next comes in a black magnesium case, with a tilt-up, 17-inch screen. Data is stored on a device that is similar to a compact disc player but uses a disc that can be erased and rewritten upon. Next said the device, supplied by <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has about 50 times the storage capacity of competitive products. `` Once or twice in a decade something like this comes along and I believe it's going to change the future of computing ... Next is incredibly great,'' said Jobs. The Next will compete with such hot-selling technical workstations as those from <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsytems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Apollo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Some of those companies are working on similar products that eventually will be sold for about $ 15,000. Apollo's manager of educational business, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON>, said in a prepared statement Wednesday that `` Jobs has a lot of catching up to do'' in the university market. `` Big software companies may not be willing to take the time and money to -LRB- adapt -RRB- to his system, an untested concept,'' <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> said. At a news conference after the demonstration, <PERSON> Jobs </PERSON> said software by <ORGANIZATION> Adobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and other companies gives the Next exceptionally vivid graphics, offering photo-like realism and numerous type fonts and sizes. The Next is built around three chips from <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, including the 68030 microprocessor, a math chip and a signal processing chip. It also has connections to industry-standard network called Ethernet that will allow Next to share files with other types of computers; <LOCATION> Mathematica </LOCATION> software, of special use for sophisticated math equations; and built-in reference sources, including a dictionary and the complete works of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>.

 Real estate mogul <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> ended a week of speculation Wednesday by announcing he has agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' profitable Northeast air shuttle for $ 365 million in cash and will rename it after himself. `` I want to run it as a diamond, an absolute diamond,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> proclaimed to reporters at a joint news conference with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> at the Plaza Hotel in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, another recent Trump acquisition He said the three-city service would be renamed `` The Trump Shuttle'' and its blue-silver <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s would be redecorated and emblazoned with red, black and gold stripes. The deal is expected to be completed by mid-December, if it survives government scrutiny and a legal attack by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions. Eastern's militant union leaders said the sale would be the death of the airline and vowed a fight to overturn the deal. The announcement of the sale followed a week of speculation about the billionaire developer's interest in buying the shuttle from ailing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which is a major subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. The $ 365 million price tag was well above previous estimates of what <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> would pay. `` It's top dollar,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON>, an airline analyst for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Many analysts and other observers had estimated that the shuttle _ which serves <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and is the most profitable of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s operations _ could fetch from $ 200 million to $ 300 million. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> had tried earlier this year to transfer the shuttle operation from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to a new subsidiary for $ 225 million, but <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> unions blocked that attempt. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in announcing that it was keeping a close eye on Eastern in the wake of the shuttle sale, said the $ 365 million was `` a generous price.'' The interest on that sum could recover more than half the cash flow that would be lost by selling the shuttle, the credit-rating agency said. For the flamboyant and image-conscious <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, the purchase of the shuttle could be viewed more as a way to enhance his prestige and influence than a straight business deal. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> bought the legendary Plaza for $ 400 million following a heated battle with other suitors. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has admitted that he was `` in love'' with the hotel for more than a decade and `` tore himself up'' to get it. But there also could be compelling business logic behind <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s latest acquisition Many analysts said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> might use the shuttle to help draw people to his hotel and casino properties in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, on the weekends. `` It's something that we're looking at,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said at the news conference. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> now operates a helicopter service from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The resort city's <LOCATION> Bader </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> is too small to handle the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s operated by the shuttle, but the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> 10 miles from the city can accommodate them. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> noted a report that he intended to sell the land earmarked for a huge commercial development in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to help finance the shuttle deal, but he did not directly address its accuracy. No interested party could afford to pay him what the 100-acre site is worth, he joked to reporters. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said the shuttle would maintain fares competitive with the competing shuttle service of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and would not lay off any employees. The $ 365 million price tag includes landing rights at airports in the three shuttle cities plus 17 planes. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said it welcomed <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> into the shuttle market. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> claims its share of that market has jumped from around 24 percent in October 1986 to roughly 45 percent. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said late Wednesday that the airline's shuttle service had net income of around $ 16.8 million in 1987 on revenue of $ 40.3 million, down from a 1985 profit of $ 28.2 million on revenue of $ 49.2 million. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> has not disclosed earnings from its shuttle operations. The shuttle deal marks another tumultuous chapter in the saga of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, the Miami-based carrier that has been scarred by management-labor feuding and $ 1 billion in losses over the past decade. `` I think -LRB- the sale -RRB- was inevitable; you could see it coming,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Borman </PERSON>, the former astronaut and chairman of Eastern. `` The inevitable problem at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has been a very recalcitrant union leadership,'' <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruces </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, where he works as an aviation consultant.

<HEAD>CBS Posts Earnings Rise, Boosts Dividend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday its third-quarter profit climbed 16 percent, reflecting improved broadcasting results and a hefty amount of interest earned on the money it has amassed from asset sales. The company also said its board had boosted the quarterly dividend by 47 percent, a move that some shareholders have been pressing for in the wake of the recent sales of major assets such as the magazine and records divisions. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said the dividend boost to $ 1.10 a share `` reconfirms our confidence in <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s future prospects and represents a tangible sharing with our shareholders of our financial well-being.'' But on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> fell 75 cents a share Wednesday to $ 178.12 -LCB-. For the three months ended Sept. 30, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 69.9 million, or $ 2.72 a share, compared with $ 60.1 million, or $ 2.31 a share, a year earlier. Third-quarter revenue rose 4 percent to $ 568.8 million from $ 545.5 million a year earlier. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> posted an operating profit of $ 49 million, up 7 percent from $ 45.6 million a year earlier. <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, president and chief executive, sales and profits were up at the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> despite the presidential election coverage and disruptions to the fall season caused by the now-resolved writer's strike. Results for the company's television stations were mixed with soft local advertising demand in some markets, the company said, while the radio division had higher sales and profits. But a big contributor to the improved overall results was the $ 44.5 million in net corporate interest income recorded for the quarter. The company had a net interest expense of $ 2.3 million in the quarter last year. For the first nine months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had a profit of $ 1.11 billion, or $ 43.16 a share, up more than fivefold from earnings of $ 200.9 million, or $ 7.84 a share, a year earlier. Nine-month revenue edged up 1 percent to $ 2.01 billion from $ 1.99 billion a year earlier. The nine-month results include an $ 866.6 million gain on the sale of the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> division to <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The new dividend, up from 75 cents a share last quarter, is payable Dec. 12 to shareholders of record Nov. 23.

<HEAD>Striking UAW Local Rejects Chrysler Contract For Second Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FENTON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Striking <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> at a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> assembly plant on Wednesday narrowly rejected a new contract, a week after walking off their jobs, a union official said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Local 110, said the three-year agreement was rejected by 41 votes, with 1,197 members voting against it and 1,156 voting for it. The suburban <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> plant is the only one producing the long-wheelbase minivan, said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Northard </PERSON>. It was the second vote on the contract, which was worked out last Friday, two days after some 3,200 union members walked off their jobs when negotiators failed to meet a contract deadline. In a vote Sunday, the contract was rejected by 61 percent of the union's rank-and-file amid reports of illegal balloting. <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> said he thought the contract was rejected Wednesday because of union members' concerns about outside contracting and `` outsourcing,'' the practice of shipping out work from the plant to lower-paid workers. Those issues were taken away from Local 110 bargainers by the international <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> said. The vote `` sends a message that the primary concern of the people on the line and in the plant lies in the outsourcing and outside contracting arena,'' <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> said. `` We recognize that this is a problem.'' <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> said the local leadership would be meeting Thursday and would be in contact with the union's national leadership. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, vice president for human resources at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, said the company was `` deeply disappointed'' by the vote because the local union bargaining committee, as well as <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> 5 and the international union, had approved the agreement last Friday. `` The result is that the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> plant employees continue to lose wages, several hundred employees elsewhere at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will remain on layoff, and the corporate-wide profit sharing program for all employees is affected adversely, as is <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s loss of revenue resulting from the strike,'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. `` We are considering the options available to us in this no-win situation,'' he said.

<HEAD>Group Begins Soliciting Zenith Shareholder Votes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A battle for control of <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> officially began Wednesday when the company's largest shareholder began soliciting shareholder consents for its plan to sell the troubled company. <ORGANIZATION> Brookhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a limited partnership formed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investors <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abelow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ihasz </PERSON>, mailed blank consent forms to all <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> shareholders along with a letter outlining its proposals and urging shareholders to sign and return the forms. If a majority of shareholders return signed forms by Dec. 4, the Brookhurst proposals will take effect, just as if shareholders had voted by proxy, <PERSON> Brookhurst </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Brookhurst </PERSON> wants to shrink <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors from 10 to six members and replace three of the remaining six with its own nominees, who would be committed to a sale of the entire company. The dissident shareholders said shareholder value `` can be maximized only through the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>, and the election of our nominees to the board of directors will best ensure that the sale of the company is both actively pursued and fairly considered.'' <PERSON> Brookhurst </PERSON> also is seeking a change in <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s bylaws to permit shareholders owning at least 10 percent of the company's stock to call a special meeting of shareholders. <ORGANIZATION> Brookhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> owns 6.1 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Glenview </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>, the last <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television manufacturer, have contended in a lawsuit that <PERSON> Brookhurst </PERSON> actually was seeking only to drive up the price of <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s stock so it could sell its shares at a profit. The company has asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to block the group's move.
