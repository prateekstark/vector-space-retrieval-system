<HEAD>NAACP Drops Out of NY Times Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it had pulled out of a suit against <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that charged the newspaper's real estate advertisements promote racial discrimination by featuring white models. Director Dr. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> `` suspended its participation'' because the organization had not held direct negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> prior to filing the suit, contrary to longstanding policy. The suit was filed Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disrict </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> by the New York Open Housing Center and four individuals, along with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. `` While other members of the coalition met with representatives of the Times, the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> was not represented and hence the Times' publisher, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochs </PERSON> <PERSON> Sulzberger </PERSON>, was correct when he complained that the lawsuit was filed without any discussion with the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> said in a news release Hooks said the failure to hold direct talks occurred `` through an adminstrative oversight.'' Hooks said the suit had not been dropped and a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> officials would be sought. `` We regret any confusion that might have arisen over this matter and have taken steps internally to see that such an oversight does not occur again,'' <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> said. On Thursday, the Times issued a statement maintaining that its advertising conforms with anti-discrimination laws and saying the complaint appeared at first reading to be `` without merit.'' The plaintiffs said photos and drawings that accompany real estate ads in the Times `` depict whites almost exclusively as potential residents, thus indicating a preference based on race.''

 <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewczenko </PERSON> has n't mastered English yet, but he reached a pinnacle in the dwindling art of deep-cut crystal glassmaking when he cut the bowl <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will give <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Inauguration Day. `` It was like a dream come true,'' the shy Polish immigrant said from his job at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION>, 40 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lewczenko </PERSON>, 39, is one of fewer than 25 master deep cutters in the country and of four on the <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION> staff. His experience cutting difficult designs nominated him for the bowls ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on the Inauguration, plant superintendent <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eshland </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Lewczenko </PERSON>, pronounced Lev-chenko, is not known as a talkative man. He did little more in a telephone interview than express his pride in the assignment and the finished piece. `` He's excited and bashful about all the publicity going on around him. He's not comfortable about it. He's -LRB- a -RRB- rather quiet man,'' his wife, <PERSON> Krystyna </PERSON>, 33, said from their home in Mount Pleasant. `` This is like <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream come true, especially ... coming to this country with 3-year-old kid, without language and $ 100 on hand,'' she said. <PERSON> Lewczenko </PERSON>'s pride was infectious, said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Handyside </PERSON>, the 33-year-old <PERSON> Lenox </PERSON> designer who interpreted the congressional committee's ideas and worked side-by-side with <PERSON> Lewczenko </PERSON>. `` The enthusiasm was just overwhelming. That was part of the excitement in working with him,'' Miss <PERSON> Handyside </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Lawrenceville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The first gift <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> receives Jan. 20 and the only one he's scheduled to get at the inaugural luncheon will be <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'s crystal bowl of nearly 20 pounds and nearly 9 inches in diameter, according to Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will receive a smaller version of the bowl, which <PERSON> Lwwczenko </PERSON> also cut. <PERSON> Lenox </PERSON> declined to reveal the price of the bowls. Blossoming cherry trees engraved on the front of each bowl frame a transparent area through which the west face of the Capitol is visible engraved on the far side of the bowl. The president's bowl rests on a 14-pound, beveled, lead glass plinth, or flat base. It is inscribed with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s name and the words `` Bicentennial Inauguration, Jan. 20, 1989.'' Rendering an architectural scene on a curved surface complicated the cutting, which was accomplished by holding the hefty piece against diamond-and carborundum-tipped cutting tools. `` It makes it even more difficult seeing through the glass to cut,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Potts </PERSON>, vice president of manufacturing for <ORGANIZATION> Lenox </ORGANIZATION>. `` The skill is to make sophisticated and accurate cuts when your're holding a heavy piece such as this. `` To hand hold this thing absolutely steady through the hours that it takes to polish this thing is absolutely unimaginable,'' Miss <PERSON> Handyside </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lewczenko </PERSON> showed an aptitude for skilled work while sculpting clay as a child, his wife said. He studied at a glass-cutting school in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> then spent 20 years cutting glass there. He and his wife and son, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>, now 10, immigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in April 1983, two weeks before huge antigovernment protests at the Lenin shipyards. <PERSON> Lewczenko </PERSON> worked as an maintenance man while building a glass-cutting machine at home to create pieces to prove himself as a cutter. A one-year stint at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> glass studio led to his job at <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION>.

 New research indicates blacks have less access to medical care than whites. According to a 1986 nationwide telephone survey, one in 11 blacks reported not seeing a doctor for economic reasons, compared with one in 20 whites. And blacks who did go to a doctor may not have been treated as well as whites, the study said. The report, which appears in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, also said blacks were less likely to have health insurance. Another study in the Journal reviewed 50 medical studies of trials of new drugs published from 1984-1986 and found that blacks were included in less than two-thirds of them. A third study looked at racial inequities in use of medical procedures for heart-disease patients in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and found that whites were 1.38 times more likely to undergo angiography, a technique for taking X-rays of the heart, and 2.26 times more likely to undergo bypass operations.

 Scientists say a new treatment for osteoporosis has proved successful in reversing the bone loss that afflicts an estimated 5 million Americans. A five-year clinical test reveals that use of a new slow-release form of sodium fluoride _ long used by dentists to strengthen teeth _ when given with calcium citrate can reverse the effects of osteoporosis by increasing bone mass, researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. Spinal osteoporosis, a gradual loss of a kind of bone found primarily in the spine, commonly affects elderly, postmenopausal women and results in shortened stature, curvature of the back and a protruding abdomen that can cause back pain and discomfort in the digestive system.

 A new ulcer drug that is still being tested is superior to one of the mainstays of ulcer treatment because it promotes healing and relieves symptoms more quickly, according to a new study. The study found the new drug, known as omeprazole, worked better in patients with stomach ulcers than Zantac, one of two widely used treatments for ulcers. Both work by blocking the body's secretion of hydrochloric acid. After one month of treatment, ulcers had healed in 80 percent of those getting omeprazole and 59 percent receiving Zantac. After two months, 96 percent of the omeprazole patients and 85 percent of the Zantac patients had healed. The results were published in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> recommends two significant changes in the routine for measles vaccinations. _ Infants under 15 months old, in areas where recurrent measles is a problem, should get two measles shots instead of one _ a shot of measles vaccine alone at 9 months, and a second dose at 15 months of the commonly used measless-mumps-rubella vaccine. _ In schools with measles outbreaks _ and in nearby schools where the disease might spread _ all students whose measles shots came before 1980 should be re-vaccinated, along with their siblings. Measles specialists have discovered two major outbreak patterns in recent years: outbreaks among infants under the 15-month vaccination age and outbreaks among school-age children who have been vaccinated but still got measles anyway. As much as 10 percent of all vaccinations do n't provide the intended protection.

Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology, said Thursday that a study involving 261 patients with active herpes infections showed that outbreaks of the disease were virtually eliminated for about half of those taking acyclovir twice daily. The others who took the drug experienced milder, shorter outbreaks. Although earlier studies showed that acyclovir was effective temporarily against herpes, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the trial was the first to demonstrate that the antiviral drug is effective over many months. A report on the study was published this month in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology.

 A Belgian soldier assigned to his country's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> embassy surrendered to police Thursday, saying he had killed two people here as revenge after breaking up with his male lover, authorities said. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Den </PERSON> <PERSON> Borre </PERSON>, 25, surrendered after making several calls to police, challenging them to `` come and find me.'' He was booked into Broward County Jail without bond on two counts of first-degree murder. He told the officer who arrested him early Thursday that he'd killed two people and was planning another murder as revenge against the lover he'd just broken up with, the <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's office said in a `` He had a lover's quarrel with his boyfriend up -LRB- in -RRB- the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area,'' sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> told reporters. `` He came down here, he was emotionally upset about that.'' Police statements said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Den </PERSON> <PERSON> Borre </PERSON> arrived in south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Jan. 4 and wandered around the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> beach area visiting gay hangouts. `` And he meets these people at local clubs, goes down on the beach with them and at some point decides that he's going to shoot and kill them,'' <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>, a 36-year-old airline reservation clerk from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, was found shot in the head Jan. 8. Less than 24 hours later, the body of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> cab driver <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Simons </PERSON>, 52, was found, similarly killed. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> police said both victims were homosexuals.

 A generation ago, when this was <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officers lived and played in the Rex Hotel, a sandbagged fortress frequently silhouetted against the night sky by flares and tracer bullets. Today, sedans instead of jeeps drive up to its doors, and uniformed doormen rather than military guards greet them. The <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> now beckons foreign businessmen and tourists, not soldiers. This is the new <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, leaving its course of economic self-destruction, opening its doors, courting capitalism. Its young are attuned more to American jeans, pop music and the good life than to a war with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> they never really knew. `` In 1975, at that time, I was just seven; I do n't know anything,'' said Thu An, a 20-year-old classical violinist studying at the Ho Chi Minh Conservatory of Music. It was in April of 1975 that the long war ended. In the fifth floor restaurant of the <PERSON> Rex </PERSON>, beneath the chandeliers, Thu An entertains <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> tourists with such ballads as `` I Left My Heart In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'' and `` The Shadow of Your Smile'' as they dine on lobster and Chateaubriand. There even was a `` Happy Birthday'' salute _ that venerable bit of Americana _ for <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> travel agent who turned 47. Black-tied waiters brought a birthday cake decked with lighted candles. For the masses, things remain the same, at least for the moment. They struggle to survive along with their proud and stubborn country, which exiled itself and waited in vain for what it considered its due from the world for standing up to the Giant of the West. Throngs of unemployed wander the streets of <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, once the boisterous capital of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate is about 25 percent and the cost of living increased in 1988 by 7 percent to 11 percent a month. Like the violinist Thu An, many young Vietnamese have no emotional attachment to the war, in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> took part from 1961 to 1975. They are restless, impatient, looking to personal futures of education, jobs and travel abroad. They envy affluent <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> neighbors and countrymen who went to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as refugees and prospered. Some older southerners live in the past, the good old days when millions of American dollars propped up the economy and brought <PERSON> Saigonese </PERSON> the luxuries they no longer can afford. More workers and government officials are speaking out about the hardships. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Thuong </PERSON>, maitre d'hotel at the Ramuncho Restuarant favored by Americans in the war years, is unhappy with the measly $ 50 a month he is paid for the same job at the Rex. `` I do not have enough food for my family,'' said <PERSON> Thuong </PERSON>, who is 53 and has six children. `` I work much but I receive nothing. At Ramuncho, I was happy.'' He looked around the room and added: `` There are government officials everywhere, but we do n't scare because our life go down.'' Some officials agree with him. One is <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON>, a Harvard-educated economist for the old <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> regime who advises the communist government in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and serves in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. `` It has deteriorated,'' he said. `` We try very hard to keep some of the hotels in a decent state so the foreign investors can come in. We need capital. We need more industrial ventures. We need technology. We have plenty of labor.'' The Vietnamese look to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for these necessities of transition from failed central planning to a market-oriented economy that allows free enterprise, competition and foreign investment. <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON> said it does not mean the end of communism, or socialism as it is called here. He explained: `` Socialism is not an end in itself. There are so many variations of the same thing. We try very hard to keep away from ideology. `` Whatever the Americans, the Europeans have done, this is the result of thousands of years of experience. Let's just take that. Do n't say this belongs to capitalism or what. Take the best of both worlds and build the economy of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' In keeping with the new approach, <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON> was blunt in evaluating the economy: `` We have had a lot of state enterprise, but these guys are no good because they just wait for the government. ... They do n't care whether -LRB- what they make -RRB- can be sold or not. `` Now it's different. We now allow the private businessman to really worry about production so they have to watch their step. They have to worry about marketing, everything, just like any other businessman.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> now imports three times more than it exports, but officials hope the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will help by providing financial aid and lifting its trade embargo once diplomatic relations are established. They say that should happen within a few years. A major sticking point is the Vietnamese occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, which began with an invasion in December 1978. Occupation troops and the government <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> installed are fighting a civil war with Cambodian guerrillas. `` If there is a political solution, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will withdraw all its troops at the latest by next September,'' said Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> <PERSON> Cong </PERSON> <PERSON> Man </PERSON>, editor of the army newspaper. `` If there is no political solution now, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will withdraw all its troops in 1990. There will be nothing to settle and to debate. Then the Americans will have no reason not to establish diplomatic relations.'' Half a million southerners, many of whom worked for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, have applied for exit visas to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to join relatives or in hopes of jobs and business opportunities. Tens of thousands have spent years trying to get out and their struggle has an ironic counterpoint: Members of the first emigrant wave, many of them now American citizens, return by the thousands for short visits with relatives and pour badly needed dollars into the economy. Gen. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Nghi </PERSON>, 58, who was captured by North Vietnamese troops shortly before the fall of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on April 30, 1975, hopes to take his wife and three children to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He was released from prison camp a year ago and says: `` I have nothing to do here.''

 A 75-year-old widow in need of money said officials tricked her out of a masterpiece for a pittance. A court agreed, giving the first round to her in one of three swindles that have shaken the French museum world. Last month, the court convicted the city of <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Decorative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> fraud </ORGANIZATION> in the purchase from <PERSON> Marie-Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Falbisaner </PERSON> of an unsigned painting attributed to <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vouet </PERSON>, court painter of King Louis XIII. When the museum did not return the painting as ordered, a magistrate charged chief curator <PERSON> Jean-Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludmann </PERSON>, 51, with `` breach of trust,'' for failing to do so. `` My family has lived for generations in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> and I wanted the family heirloom to remain here,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Falbisaner </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` This is what I get for being sentimental. I was gypped.'' <PERSON> Ludmann </PERSON>, the museum and <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> have appealed. A decision is expected within two years and Mrs. <PERSON> Falbisaner </PERSON> hopes to recover the painting, now in storage at the museum. `` Knock wood, I wo n't die before then,'' she said. Also in December, charges were brought against <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, chief curator of paintings at the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION>, for involvement in the purchase of a work by 17th century portraitist <PERSON> Bartolome </PERSON> <PERSON> Esteban </PERSON> <PERSON> Murillo </PERSON> for half its estimated worth. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, a scholar with an international reputation, was accused of either knowing or purposely ignoring the fact that the painting, `` The Gentleman of <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>,'' might have been stolen from its owner, an elderly, eccentric heiress who died under suspicious circumstances in 1986. Another elderly widow saw justice done in December when an unsigned painting by <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Poussin </PERSON> was returned to her and she sold it for $ 1.4 million. Twenty years ago, her husband sold it for the equivalent of $ 366 to the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION>, whose experts had noticed the mislabeled painting in a sale catalogue. After the museum displayed it as a <LOCATION> Poussin </LOCATION>, the family sued. The court ruled that the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> did not have the right to use its vast resources and expertise to cheat ordinary citizens. French museums have been an elite preserve, some say above the law, so newspapers recounted the unfolding dramas like installments in a seamy soap opera. `` Is there something rotten in the kingdom of museums?'' art critic <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Foucart </PERSON> asked in <ORGANIZATION> Beaux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, recalling <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON>'s moral dilemma. `` Curator Tripped Up By Canvas,'' one headline sniffed. An editorial by <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dupuy </PERSON> in the newspaper Liberation was called `` The Scholar Gone Astray.'' The latest episode is known as the Vouet Affair for the 17th century portraitist who experts say is the likely creator of Mrs. <PERSON> Falbisaner </PERSON>'s unsigned `` Allegory of Force.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Falbisaner </PERSON>'s story began in 1986 when she decided to supplement her monthly pension of about $ 450 by selling `` Allegory'' to the city of <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> for about $ 55,000. It had been in the family for more than 250 years and was believed to be the work of <PERSON> Vouet </PERSON>, who introduced the Italian Baroque School to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Experts examined the painting before the sale, however, and to Mrs. <PERSON> Falbisaner </PERSON>'s chagrin, concluded it was a high-quality example of the Vouet school but not by the master himself. The museum still was interested, however, and curator <PERSON> Ludmann </PERSON> borrowed the work to examine its condition, a standard procedure. Without telling Mrs. <PERSON> Falbisaner </PERSON>, he took the painting to the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> for laboratory examinations, including X-rays. Tests indicated the work was by <PERSON> Vouet </PERSON>, or at the very least attributable to him. That information was not passed on to Mrs. <PERSON> Falbisaner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ludmann </PERSON> sent an enthusiastic letter to city officials urging them to approve the sale. The tests, he wrote, `` reveal the existence of several retouchings by the artist himself.'' He said the price was `` more than reasonable, and assuredly advantageous, given <PERSON> Vouet </PERSON>'s fame and his value on today's market.'' Both the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> officials have denied formally authenticating the work as a <ORGANIZATION> Vouet </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm convinced the essentials of the painting _ its composition, idea and colors _ are <PERSON> Vouet </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Ludmann </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, but added that he can not be certain because the work is unsigned. Big money is at stake. In today's art market, a Vouet is estimated to be worth up to $ 500,000, nearly 10 times what the museum agreed to pay Mrs. <PERSON> Falbisaner </PERSON>. Many in the art world say privately they are delighted to see museums get a comeuppance, but have closed ranks publicly, dismissing the scandals as the price of becoming fashionable. `` Ten years ago, no one outside the museum world would have noticed,'' one said privately. `` Today, a curator is a superstar who appears on television and dines with the mayor.'' <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Cremin </PERSON>, a respected art critic, said: `` The museums, because of their limited acquisitions budgets, have to be on the lookout for bargains. `` These kinds of affairs have probably happened countless times in the past. The difference is the money involved. The ordinary person today hires a good lawyer to get the property back, and the story makes the papers.''

 <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> seems of another time, a time when <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Odetta </PERSON>, <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> celebrated freedom and the spirit of man, and defied brutality and repression with their songs and anthems. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, whose self-titled debut album has been nominated for six Grammys, is of this age and her songs take a hard, cold look at poverty, racism, inequality and human relations. She is uncompromising, tough and compassionate. `` I think people look at the world in many different ways and choose to see what they like,'' she said in an interview last year with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think lots of people ignore some of the harder issues, the more unpleasant things. I do n't think I harp on them.'' Her LP opens with `` Talkin' Bout a Revolution,'' a song that tells of `` standing in the welfare lines Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation Wasting time in the unemployment lines Sitting around waiting for a promotion Poor people gon na rise up And get their share Poor people gon na rise up And take what's theirs.'' Until `` <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'' hit record stores last April, the 24-year-old poet-singer-songwriter-folksinger was one of the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area's best kept secrets. As an anthrolopolgy major at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, she performed in coffee houses and clubs, and was a local hit. The LP, with its range from folk to pop ballad to reggae, enchanted millions more. It has sold over 4 million copies and has been nominated for album of the year and best contemporary folk recording. The single, `` Fast Car,'' has been nominated for best song and record of the year, and <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> herself is up for best new artist and best female pop vocalist. `` Fast Car'' was a No. 1 hit and tells of a high school dropout who works to supports her alcoholic father and who wants to escape it all with her unemployed boyfriend: `` You got a fast car And I got a plan to get us out of here I been working at the convenience store Managed to save just a little bit of money We wo n't have to drive too far Just ` cross the border and into the city You and I can both get jobs And finally see what it means to be living. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s rich contralto with its melancholic underpinnings is an instrument by itself and highly effective on `` Behind the Wall,'' a song about a battered woman. She sings a capella of the harsh realties of the domestic fight: `` Last night I heard the screaming - Then a silence that chilled my soul'' _ and slams the police for doing nothing. She grew up in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and has been singing since she was a child. She was in a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> boarding school when singer-songwriters had been put out to pasture by synthesizer philistines. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> did n't turn on her radio, but many of her classmates listened to folk music and played guitar. In college, one of her classmates was <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppelman </PERSON>, whose father, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, is a leader in the music publishing business. This gave her the wedge she needed to gain entry to the recording world. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, whose musical roots can be traced to <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Armatrading </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, was part of a new wave of singer-songwriters in the late 1980s, especially women such as <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Childs </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Etheridge </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Shocked </PERSON>.

 Public school officials, concerned that students may be living on the streets, opened homeless shelters in two <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> schools Thursday so needy pupils can get beds, showers and a meal. A 12-year-old girl who had been sleeping under an abandoned house was the first of eight people to enter the shelters, officials said. `` We did n't discuss anything with the child when she came in,'' said school board President <PERSON> Melody </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>. `` Right now she's playing checkers with one of the administrators. We just tried to give her encouragement and let her play.'' The shelters will remain open nightly until at least Jan. 20, when the superintendent the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> will recommend to the school board that the program be continued or modified. Within an hour of opening, six children arrived at the shelters, and Ms. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said four other young boys who showed up at one of the campuses left before entering, apparently because of television cameras nearby. `` It is drizzling outside and it is extremely cold, and I would really like for these children to come in,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said when asking reporters to leave the area. Temperatures were in the low 40s Thursday night. By late evening eight youths and one parent were in the two shelters, including a homeless woman with five children, all enrolled in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> schools, and a 14-year-old dropout. <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> is estimated to have 20,000 to 25,000 people who live on the streets or in shelters, but it's uncertain how many of those are children. The school shelters are not intended for children whose families are staying in city shelters, but rather for those pupils who seem to live alone on the streets. `` We've had teachers discovering students sleeping in areas around schools, storing clothes under houses in the neighborhood and some who are asking for help,'' school district spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Yawn </PERSON> said. It's not certain why those pupils are on the streets, however. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said use of the term `` homeless'' for the school program may be a misnomer. `` I know there's children out there,'' she said. `` But I certainly did n't think they were in school. These children have a home somewhere, but they either are abused or choose not to be at home.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said programs already exist for `` truly homeless'' children, whose parents, for example, may be living out of their cars. Other social service programs also exist for children who need a `` cooling-off'' time away from their parents, she said. `` There are vacancies in shelters right now,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said. `` It's going to be interesting to find out what these principals have been seeing.'' Under the Schoolhouse Shelters program, approved this week and announced Wednesday, volunteers from the school system and other social agencies will staff the shelters, which officials hope may lead to more permanent assistance for homeless youths seeking help in a familiar place. One school is set up to handle children from kindergarten through eighth grade. The other is intended for high school students. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has donated 75 beds and blankets. Existing showers and dressing rooms in gymnasiums of the schools will be used, officials said. The cost to the school district, while not yet determined, should be minimal, officials said. The district is providing food _ soup and sandwiches _ and security guards. The program will serve only students enrolled in the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, among the nation's 10-largest districts with about 190,000 students. Security officers will guard against drugs and weapons, and <PERSON> Yawn </PERSON> said hand-held metal detectors will be used at the school entrance. Students entering the shelters, operated from 5:30 p.m. until 7 a.m., will have to prove they are enrolled before entering.

<HEAD>Bush Known as `Ellie the Elephant' After Wartime Rescue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Surviving crew members of the World War II submarine Finback are looking forward to a nostalgic reunion with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the young <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot they dubbed `` Ellie the Elephant'' after rescuing him from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> more than 44 years ago. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohler </PERSON>, 64, of <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, the torpedoman who helped pull a grateful <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to safety from his orange life raft onto the Finback's deck, remembers offering a smile and a hearty `` welcome aboard,'' but recalls little else about the incident `` At that time, he was just another downed pilot,'' said <PERSON> Kohler </PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> businessman. `` Nobody back then knew he'd become president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Rescued after his plane was shot down by Japanese fire, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> eagerly took his turn at night lookout watches and other seagoing duties, watched <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Grable </PERSON> movies in the wardroom and donned earphones to listen in awe as the submarine's torpedoes sank two enemy ships. Former Finback officers remember the 20-year-old <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a gregarious jokester who earned the nickname `` Ellie'' for his comic wardroom imitation of a trumpeting elephant, they said in recent telephone interviews. `` I remember he was very lively, obviously intelligent and very personable,'' said retired Rear Adm. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyworth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who was the Finback's torpedo and gunnery officer when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was hauled aboard on Sept. 2, 1944. Said <PERSON> Heyworth </PERSON>: `` All three pilots we rescued were bright, bright-eyed young men, but <PERSON> George </PERSON> seemed the most outgoing and had the most ebullient personality. He was the most entertaining, and he made us laugh a lot. `` We called him <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON> because of his outstanding imitation of an elephant trumpeting. <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON> the Elephant. It was n't because we all sat around thinking we were Republicans. We must have seen one in a Tarzan movie. We just thought elephants were funny. We kept asking <PERSON> George </PERSON> to do it over and over again.'' `` He had a tremendous sense of humor,'' recalled W.E. `` Bill'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, an insurance agent and retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> commander. As a bearded ensign aboard the Finback, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> filmed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s rescue with an 8mm Kodak movie camera. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said that at last count, nearly 30 surviving officers and enlisted crewmen of the Finback were planning to attend <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s swearing-in at noontime Jan. 20 at the Capitol They and a few of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s former flying buddies plan to sit together in prime bleacher seats on <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> for the inaugural parade after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes the presidential oath of office. Inaugural officials reportedly were trying to arrange a reunion for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his old submarine buddies at <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the presidential guest quarters across the street from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, possibly next Wednesday. <PERSON> Heyworth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> have stayed in touch with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over the years. But most of the Finback veterans have n't seen or spoken to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> since he left the submarine at <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> after a month-long combat patrol. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the Distinguished Flying Cross for completing his bombing run against a <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> center </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Bonin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, about 600 miles south of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, after his Grumman Avenger torpedo bomber was struck by enemy fire and engulfed in flames. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bailed out over the water but his two crew members were lost. According to his autobiography, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s only injuries were a gash on the forehead and a painful sting from a Portuguese man-of-war. He was picked up by the Finback less than two hours after his parachute hit the ocean. `` I'm proud of what I was able to do to help Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on board our boat,'' said <PERSON> Kohler </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON>, 71, a Finback veteran and retired radiation laboratory technician living in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, gave little thought to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the time. `` We brought him aboard, dried him out and gave him hot coffee,'' he said, and then forgot him. `` I was 26 years old and a first class torpedoman,'' <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Who'd pay any attention to a 20-year-old kid?''

 Retired Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> is scrambling back to his battle station three years after ending a sparkling 41-year <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> career. But this time the threat is a homegrown crisis instead of a foreign power. He was nominated Thursday by President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which has been rocked by a partial shutdown of the nuclear plants that produce the nation's atomic warheads and by the prospect of devoting tens of billions of dollars to rebuilding and cleaning up the aging nuclear complex. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, 61, has no background in the commercial energy field, but he has been associated with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear operations since early in his career, which was capped by a four-year stint as chief of naval operations, the top <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer. In 1958, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> studied nuclear engineering at <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, one of the links in the nationwide nuclear bomb-making network. He later taught at <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> nuclear training centers and worked in the Naval Reactors Division of the <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a forerunner of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. At a news conference following the announcement of his nomination as energy secretary, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said grappling with the nuclear weapons plants problem would be his `` first order of business'' before his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearings start. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' selection came just hours after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> formally endorsed an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report recommending that $ 81 billion be spent over the next two decades to modernize the nuclear bomb factories. It acknowledged that budget constraints would make it difficult to carry out the plan. One of the most immediate threats posed by the nuclear weapons plant problem is the possibility that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could run low on tritium, a short-lived radioactive gas that <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reactors produce for atomic warheads. Last year, the last of the tritium-producing reactors was shut down for safety reasons, leaving the country at least temporarily without fresh supplies of the gas. The Pentagon has said the reactors must be restarted soon in order to avoid jeopardizing the nation's nuclear arsenal, but officials have not said just when the problem would become critical. No date has been set for restarting the tritium-producing reactors, although <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s report said it was unlikely before late 1989. Even once the key reactors are made safe and put back into operation, the new energy secretary will face great uncertainty over whether and when to build a new generation of tritium-producing plants. The existing ones are more than 30 years old. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s report called them obsolete and in need of replacement A related, and perhaps more long-lasting, problem is finding the technology _ and the money _ to clean up the widespread environmental damage caused by four decades of bomb-making. Energy industry officials welcomed the selection of <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, although his name was not among the many that had churned through <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> rumor mills in recent weeks. `` Adm. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has demonstrated his ability as a leader and administrator,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBona </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, representing major oil companies. Other officials urged <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> to tackle the military reactors problem immediately. `` It is especially important that this national security issue be handled skillfully ... so it does not become an abiding distraction to other energy issues,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group. Although the nuclear problem is likely to give <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> his most immediate headaches, the new energy secretary will face challenges on other fronts. Among them are: _ An emerging battle in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over whether to raise the federal gasoline tax as a way of curbing gasoline consumption and cutting the federal budget deficit Debate over a possible tax on oil imports also is likely to heighten this year. _ A growing wave of oil imports that has increased concern about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependence on <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Some economists and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have said the government should act now to insulate the nation better against a supply disruption _ particularly in the volatile <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> _ that could force up oil prices. _ Calls by the natural gas industry for ending all controls on gas prices Consumer groups are opposed. _ Deciding whether to open up more federal lands in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and elsewhere for oil and gas exploration Conservations are strongly opposed; the oil companies say such additional exploration is vital to halting a recent slide in domestic oil production.

<HEAD>DOE Report Says Accelerator Safer Way to Make Weapons Material</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An unreleased <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> report concludes that a linear accelerator could produce one of the key ingredients in nuclear weapons more cheaply, quickly and safely than new production reactors could. Such an accelerator would produce far less radioactive waste than a nuclear reactor and `` should be more readily acceptable to the public,'' according to a draft summary of the report obtained by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supply of tritium, a radioactive gas used to produce nuclear warheads, is threatened by the crumbling condition of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s existing weapons plants and reactors. The report, prepared by scientists at the <LOCATION> Brookhaven </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION> national laboratories and at <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse-Hanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, concluded that an accelerator could produce enough tritium to meet all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons needs. An accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic particles are whipped at high speeds until they crash into a target, in this case lithium clad in aluminium. The resulting collision produces tritium. According to the report, using such an accelerator to make tritium would not produce any `` long-lived'' nuclear wastes and `` costs associated with safety and environmental concerns should be minimal.'' In addition, it said, an accelerator `` does not have the licensing requirements associated with nuclear reactors and should be more readily acceptable to the public.'' Last July, the department recommended building two new production reactors, one at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> complex near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and the other at the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. At present, the nation's only facilities for producing tritium are three reactors at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, but all three are shut down either for maintenance or because of safety problems. Department officials have said that at least one of the reactors should be back on line this year, but the start-up date continues to slip as more problems are found. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> looked `` briefly'' at using an accelerator to produce tritium, but ended up recommending construction of two new reactors, said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON>, a DOE spokeswoman. `` The board concluded that these technologies were not mature enough to provide new production capacity in the next 10 to 12 years,'' she said. But the DOE report said that the nation's tritium needs could be met by using an accelerator `` that could be in operation as early as 1996.'' By comparison, the proposed new reactors are expected to take a minimum of 10 years to complete. `` The required accelerator technology has largely been demonstrated at the component level although some additional development work is desirable to effect cost reductions, improved performance and ease of operation,'' the report said. The accelerator would take massive amounts of electricity to operate, roughly the entire output of a nuclear power plant. One potential site for it would be in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, which has the cheapest electric rates in the nation. The report said `` preliminary discussions'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> indicated that the federal power marketing agency based in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, would have enough electricity available to power an accelerator. An accelerator could cost more to build, but because the cost of operating it would be about half that of a reactor, `` total life cycle costs,'' including construction, would be about 25 percent less, said <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Grand </PERSON>, a scientist at <LOCATION> Brookhaven </LOCATION>. The two planned new reactors would cost an estimated $ 6.8 billion. Grand acknowledged that `` those are ballpark figures and we need to do a lot more work to come up with firm estimates.'' But he said he was convinced that construction of an accelerator would `` alleviate all the safety, licensing and waste problems'' associated with a reactor. Grand said that while radioactive waste would be produced, `` you wo n't have the transuranic wastes that are the culprits in terms of long-term storage.''

 Congressmen, teachers, and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> princes will no longer be invited by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to be passengers on the space shuttle under a new policy that emphasizes completing the recovery from the Challenger accident in which two non-astronauts were killed. The space agency announced a new category of `` space flight participants'' and said, at the same time, that flight opportunities for them `` are not available at this time.'' Before the Challenger exploded on liftoff Jan. 28, 1986, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had given minimum training to a senator, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> prince and <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, the first `` Teacher in Space.'' Mrs. <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> was killed along with industrial engineer <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> and five astronauts. `` The Challenger accident marked a major change in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> outlook and policies with respect to the flight of other than <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> astronauts,'' the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said in the policy statement Thursday. `` <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and interested external parties, domestic and international, must re-examine previous understandings, expectations, and commitments regarding flight opportunities.'' At the time of the Challenger explosion, the process of choosing a reporter to fly on the shuttle was in its final stages. Committees had winnowed down thousands of applications to 40. When the shuttle does begin flying non-essential passengers again, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said, a teacher will be the first. The agency said that for now, flight opportunities generally will be limited to professional astronauts and payload specialists essential for mission requirements while it works to improve the reliability of the shuttle and reduces a payload backlog. The new space flight participant category embraces those `` whose presence on board the space shuttle is not required for operation of payloads or for other essential mission mission activities, but is determined by the administrator of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to contribute to other approved <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> objectives or to be in the national interest.'' Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, flew on the shuttle in April 1985 and Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., was aboard in January 1986, at the invitation of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s administrator Both hold positions important to the space program on congressional committees and the official explanation was that the flights were important to their oversight responsibilities. In 1985, shuttle passengers included <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Saud </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Neri </PERSON> <PERSON> Vela </PERSON>, a Mexican. They were aboard, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said, to `` observe'' the launches of the Arabsat and Morelos-B communications satellites for their countries. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said that while it remains committed to a long-term goal of providing such flight opportunities it is devoting its energies to proving that the shuttle is safe and reliable. `` Accordingly, flight opportunities for space flight participants are not available at this time,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` When <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> determines that a flight opportunity is available for a space flight participant, first priority will be given to a Teacher in Space in fulfillment of space education plans.'' All shuttle flights will be planned with a minimum crew of five <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> astronauts and can be increased to a maximum of seven for payload or other mission requirements, the agency said. Such added crew members have to be chosen at least 12 months before the flight and first consideration will be given to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s own people.

<TEXT>
 With only a week to go, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is managing to eke out a few foreign policy successes before turning leadership in world affairs over to President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his deputies. The withdrawal of 450 Cuban soldiers from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> this week marks the beginning of the end of a 14-year presence in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> country. The pullout is part of a deal arranged by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that will bring independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, now under South African control. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of state for African affairs, worked eight difficult years for a settlement, continuing efforts that began early in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration. The Cuban exodus does not end the war in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The Marxist government, armed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, is still fighting the rebel Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, which has been supported by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But the war is likely to be less intense, and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> will get the independence <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was unwilling to grant despite worldwide condemnation. In <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the Soviets have again started to withdraw their troops despite threats to stall until a political settlement is worked out with U.S.-armed rebels. Transports carried some units out by air this week, while others streamed northward from the Soviet garrison in the capital city of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. By Feb. 15, the last of the 50,000 Soviet troops are supposed to be gone. Here, too, the departure of a foreign army does not mean peace is settling in. But the fighting may slacken. Rebels armed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have government forces on the run. Without Soviet backing, however, President <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> and his army could collapse without much of a struggle. Soviet troops have been in the country since December 1979. Their ouster was a main foreign policy goal of the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and then the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Success came partly as a result of massive Soviet losses and the kind of anguish at home that Americans suffered during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. But the advent of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in April 1985 and the smoother relationship he worked out with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had a lot to do with it. Superpower cooperation also helped bring about the African settlement and the ongoing Vietnamese troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, although it did not crack the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict or have an impact on the wars in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. In the meantime, the outgoing administration is defying tradition by not just fading away. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has purchased his tickets for flying home to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> right after the inaugural next Friday. But a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet is waiting for him to board at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Base this weekend. The idea is to fly to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and celebrate the end of a 27-month human rights conference, hold a 32nd and final meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and make preparations for East-West arms control talks. Those negotiations will seek the reduction of troops all across the European landscape. The idea is to ease tensions between the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. To get those talks going, the Soviets met <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands for the release of more than 600 political prisoners, the reunification of more than 100 families and stepped-up emigration of Jews, ethnic Germans and Armenians. The <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> trip is on hold, though, pending resolution of a dispute between <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> over how much Turkish territory across from <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> will be included in the reduction talks.

<HEAD>Hawaii Convention For Troubled System Stirs Protests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the financially beleaguered Farm Credit System, says it makes sense to send nearly 200 of its representatives to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> later this month for a midwinter convention. Protests have been raised by a grassroots unit in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which tried unsuccessfully to get the council's <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, district to reduce its number of delegates to the meeting. The Fargo board objected to sending a 14-member district delegation, plus some staff people, to the Jan. 24 meeting scheduled at the Sheraton-Waikiki Hotel. After the one-day council meeting, most of the delegates will attend the annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperatives </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 25-26. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s national office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the council is an affiliate of the <ORGANIZATION> NCFC </ORGANIZATION>, which will send about 800 delegates to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, compared with the council's 175 The council handles lobbying activities for the cooperative Farm Credit System, which includes nationwide networks of federal land banks, production credit associations, bank for cooperatives and the federal intermediate credit bank. Overall, the system has a loan portfolio of more than $ 50 billion. As a result of a continuing financial crisis and huge losses, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> late in 1987 drew up a bailout plan that could pour as much as $ 4 billion into the ailing system. <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> said Thursday in a telephone interview that the <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> convention site was selected in 1983 by the <ORGANIZATION> NCFC </ORGANIZATION> and that the council had studied the situation for almost a year before deciding to go to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> or hold its own annual meeting somewhere else and apart from the <ORGANIZATION> NCFC </ORGANIZATION>. Although there was some agonizing over the potential public relations harm of going to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> said that a cost analysis showed it was good business to join <ORGANIZATION> NCFC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> said other sites were studied, including <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and cities in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Air travel to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> will be `` a little bit higher for a larger number of people'' than to mainland cities, he said. But those additional costs will be offset by other things, such as holding a joint reception and sharing other functions with the <ORGANIZATION> NCFC </ORGANIZATION>. `` So we decided to do it, knowing that there could be some criticism about it,'' <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, called the decision to send Farm Credit System officials to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> `` a foolish mistake'' in the wake of the $ 4 billion bailout passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` We did n't bail them out to send them to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> said. `` We bailed them out to help family farmers.'' <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, in response to an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> query, said the Farm Credit System has `` done a pretty good job under some rough circumstances, but this is the kind of foolishness that shows a lack of sensitivity to how things look to the folks out there in the country who are paying bills.'' He added: `` There are plenty of empty hotels in the farm belt that would love to host a meeting of the Farm Credit folks. There might be less sun, and also less heat for the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>.''

 Flue-cured tobacco farmers and buyers each will be assessed 1.12 cents per pound for the 1989 crop, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The total of 2.24 cents covers a no-net cost assessment of 2 cents per pound and 0.24 cents to help cover the federal budget deficit. The 1989 total assessment will be down slightly from last year's total of 2.26 cents per pound. Department officials said Thursday they consulted with the Flue-cured <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the producer-owned association that handles the support program, before determining the 1989 assessment. The budget deficit assessment will be imposed according to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, which calls for a reduction in the level of price support by 1.4 percent or, alternatively, an assessment on producers to achieve and equal reduction in spending. Officials said the 1989 price support for flue-cured tobacco will remain at $ 1.468 per pound as announced on Dec. 15 for this year's crop

<HEAD>Non White Males More Likely to Be Killed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Take two boys born today. One is white. The other is not. The chances are five times greater that the non-white boy eventually will become a murder victim, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> says. Non-white males born now face a 1 in 38 chance of ending up the victim of a killer, while the risk for white males born today is 1 in 204, according to a statistical study released Thursday. The odds faced by the entire population born today are 1 out of 177, the study found. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Propheter </PERSON>, a statistician with the Uniform Crime Reporting program, cautioned that the predictions are based on 1987 figures and do not account for possible changes in the murder rate. `` We ca n't look into the future and say there are going to be so many murders in 1999,'' said <PERSON> Propheter </PERSON>, who prepared the report with statistician <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>. `` This is based on what happened in 1987.'' The murder rate in 1987 was 8.3 per 100,000 population. That year, there were an estimated 20,100 murders nationwide, of which 9,510 victims were non-white, 7,436 of them non-white males. The murder rate in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for that year was 2.5 per 100,000. Between 1967 and 1987, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> murder rate leaped 34 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> reported. The highest rate in the past 10 years was 10.2 per 100,000 population in 1980, and the lowest was 7.9 per 100,000 in 1984 and 1985. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> study was based on the Uniform Crime Reporting statistics added to a computer model. It did not break down the non-white category for blacks, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and other minorities, <PERSON> Propheter </PERSON> said. If there were no murders, the average lifespan for all Americans would increase by almost 3 months, and the average lifespan for non-white males would increase by more than 11 months, the study found. A person born now can expect to live about 75 years, according to health statistics. The study _ which calculated the probabilities of being murdered for newborns, those age 20 and those age 40 _ predicted that while newborn non-white males have a 1 in 38 chance of becoming a murder victim, the chance for non-white females is 1 in 138. For both sexes combined, the chance is 1 in 60. For newborn white males, the risk is 1 in 204, while for white females, it's 1 in 437 for a combined chance of 1 in 277. For newborns of all races, the chance of being murdered is 1 in 122 for males, 1 in 324 for females and 1 in 177 for both sexes. The least likely to be murdered _ among the ages calculated by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> _ are white women who are now 40. They have only a 1 in 931 chance of being murdered. Of all the groups now 40, the highest probability of being murdered remains non-white males, with a 1 in 97 chance. The overall odds for that age group is 1 out of 453. As for men who already have reached age 20, non-whites have a 1 in 41 chance of being murdered, while whites have a 1 in 224 chance, for an overall chance of 1 in 136. For females who are now 20, non-whites have a 1 in 157 likelihood of being murdered, and whites have a 1 in 504 chance for a total probability of one in 376.

<HEAD>Studies Say Changes Needed To Help Older Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Looming shortages of skilled labor can be eased by relying more on older workers, provided they receive training and their old-age benefits are protected, according to a group of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> studies. `` Educational reform in public schools should eventually maximize the labor force of the future, but can not immediately remedy the skills shortage of today's population,'' Labor Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said Thursday in releasing the department studies. `` I think clearly that older workers should be tapped across the board.'' One of the reports, the department's first extensive analysis of potential labor shortages, said major shortages could occur because the economy is projected to grow at 2 percent to 3 percent annually while the rate of work force growth will be just 1 percent. The median age of workers is projected to rise from the current 36 to 39 by the end of the century, with the number of people aged 45 and over increasing from the 1986 total of 74.2 million to 96.3 million. The government said that most employers, while aggressively pursuing members of the shrinking pool of younger workers, have ignored the special needs of older workers, including flexible scheduling, job sharing, health care and phased retirements. In some cases it actually costs older workers to continue working past the age when they are eligible to retire, the studies said. That is because Social Security and private pension provisions often penalize beneficiaries who continue or resume working. The Social Security penalties slowly are being phased out, but the report said that a faster timetable should be considered and that employers should revamp their private plans, offering employees incentives to work to a later age. Another key to keeping older workers on the payroll, researchers said, is retraining employees to reflect the changing labor market. `` Far more attention needs to be given to the design of jobs and working conditions that are deliberately tailored to the distinctive capabilities, limitations, needs and preferences of older workers now employed and others who, under the right circumstances, might choose to become re-employed,'' the department said. `` The barriers are formidable but not insurmountable.'' The reports said the definition of older workers can vary, involving employees as young as 47 in some cases. But most problems are faced by workers in their 60s. Workforce participation drops significantly at age 62 and again at 65 because these are eligibility dates for Social Security and many pensions.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> led a hushed crowd at a military review in a moment of silence for the 595 members of the armed services who died in the line of duty during his administration. `` They volunteered; they chose to serve; they gave their lives; they are our heroes,'' the president said at Thursday's ceremony in the gleaming new hangar that will be home to the new Air Force One being built to replace the aging presidential aircraft. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> led the tribute at a Pentagon-sponsored ceremony honoring him for his service as commander in chief. Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> presented the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distinguished </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and medals from the armed services to the president. During his remarks, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> complimented all of those in uniform. `` The gratitude of a nation comfortable and at peace properly goes, not to me, but rather to all of you,'' he said. `` Over the last eight years, the luster has been restored to the reputation of our fighting forces, after a time during which it was shamefully fashionable to deride and even condemn service such as yours,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the assembly. `` Those days will never come again,'' he said, to thunderous applause. The Marine Band followed its traditional playing of the Marine Hymn and other armed service anthems with a rendition of the sentimental `` <PERSON> Auld </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> <PERSON> Syne </PERSON>.'' The unusual review was to have been held outdoors and include fly-overs of 17 aircraft from all the services plus the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. It was forced inside by a chilly rain. The fly-overs were called off.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says some civil rights leaders are doing so well by `` keeping alive the feeling that they're victims of prejudice'' that he sometimes wonders whether they `` really want what they say they want. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made the statement in an interview to be broadcast Sunday on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television program, `` 60 Minutes.'' Portions of the interview were broadcast Thursday on the CBS Evening News. The president defended himself against criticism of his civil rights record, saying he was a lifelong foe of discrimination and `` one of the great things that I have suffered in this job is this feeling and this editorializing comment that somehow I'm on the other side.'' Of the black leaders who have criticized him, he said, `` Sometimes I wonder if they really want what they say they want because some of those leaders are doing very well leading organizations based on keeping alive the feeling that they're victims of prejudice. He declined to name names. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> of `` 60 Minutes'' conducted separate interviews with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the Oval Office and with first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the presidential residence.

<HEAD>Bush's Choice For Drug Czar Is Blunt-Spoken Conservative</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Early in <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s tenure as secretary of education, when he was still on speaking terms with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the teacher union asked <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> what he would do if he had a magic wand to wave over American schools. `` No drugs _ none, zero, out, gone, disappear,'' replied the blunt-spoken educator. `` Give me a wand? All the drugs: gone.'' During his 3 -LCB- years in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Cabinet, the conservative and combative <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> often spoke out about the drug `` plague'' and chafed at what he felt was an inadequate effort by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> team to combat the problem. Now, as President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice to be the nation's first drug czar, it will fall on the shoulders of the burly former college football lineman to find a way to win that war. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, 45, was a headline-grabbing education secretary who railed against rising college costs and slipshod standards, and spoke his mind freely on topics in and out of his field, from defense of Western civilization courses to AIDS to a trip to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> to thumb his nose at the Sandinista government. His spirited defense of education budget cuts _ including a 1987 attempt to cut in half a $ 200 million drug education program _ made him unpopular with school groups and some lawmakers. It was <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> who made the call to embattled <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> in November 1987 suggesting <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> withdraw because of his admitted use of marijuana while a law professor. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> himself grew up in the raucous 1960s, flirted with the idea of joining the radical Students for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and had a blind date as a graduate student in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with hard-rocking <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON>, who later died of a drug overdose. A onetime rock band guitarist, he is an unabashed fan of early rock' n' roll of the <ORGANIZATION> Buddy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> <PERSON> Valens </PERSON> variety. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> after the <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> affair, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON> just `` drank a couple of beers.'' He turned aside a question about whether he had ever used marijuana, saying, `` I will not join this procession of confessors. If I have any confessions to make, I will make them to a priest. I will stipulate for the record, however, I was young.'' But <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> had said flatly in prior interviews that he never tried illicit drugs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked at Thursday's announcement if he knew his new drug czar was `` addicted to nicotine.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> referred the question to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, but added, `` He knows his mandate.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a longtime two-pack-a-day smoker, told reporters, `` You will not have a director of national drug control policy who smokes.'' Asked when he was quitting, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, whose post requires <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation, said, `` By the time I'm national director.'' He left <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Cabinet in September to write, open a small policy shop called the <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, and deliver lectures at reported fees of up to $ 15,000-per-apperance. He found fault with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> war on drugs, best known for <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` just say no'' crusade. `` An all-out war on drugs _ with more resources for police, more prosecutors, more convictions, more jail sentences _ would be popular with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people ... and it would be the right thing to do,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> magazine `` I wish we had done more in the area of drugs. We have done a lot more than some people will give us credit for, but our policies on drugs could have been more coherent, more direct. We could have taken not only the moral lead, which I think President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did, but more of the legislative lead,'' he said. According to an account in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> last May 23, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> repeatedly urged the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to unleash the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military against foreign drug traffickers. `` The military should do to the drug barons what our forces in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> did to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> reportedly advised in one memo. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is a Brooklyn-born son of a bank officer and a medical secretary who was raised in the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> suburbs of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after his parents divorced. He majored in philosophy at <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> after abandoning plans to pursue a career in advertising. After obtaining his Ph.D. in philosophy from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> and his law degree at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> taught at several campuses and eventually ran the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in Research Triangle Park, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. He was chairman of NEH from 1981-1985. As the third education secretary, he made headlines from the start, when he defended steep student aid cuts by suggesting some students would simply have to undergo `` divestiture of certain sorts: stereo divestiture, automobile divestiture, three-weeks-at-the-beach divestiture.'' He infuriated college administrators with his broadsides against rising costs, and once challenged them to start the new academic year by sending each of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s 12 million college students a letter warning that drug use would not be tolerated. But even some of his enemies admired the flood of attention he brought to education. In a <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll of notables last spring, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> emerged as the choice for best <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointee. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Elayne </PERSON>, a social worker, have a 5-year-old son, <PERSON> John </PERSON>.

 If elections came down to who was the butt of more jokes on late-night television, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be sharing the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would be president for life. A study of monologues by <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> found that the score during the general campaign was virtually a tie: 51 jokes about Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to 50 about his Democratic opponent, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The study by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Amundson </PERSON> of the private, non-partisan <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> found that the biggest target was <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the vice president-elect. He drew 52 barbs _ more than 10 times Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s total of five. The president-elect did better as the political season progressed. During the primary campaigns, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was on the receiving end of more jokes than all his Democratic opponents combined. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s improved media image this fall even reached into the realm of late-night comedy. But <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> got stuck with <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s role as the all-purpose political joke,'' said <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Amundson </PERSON>. Some of their findings: _ When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mistakenly referred to Sept. 7 as Pearl Harbor Day, <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> played up the gaffe for three days One example: `` A reporter pointed out to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that the Japanese attacked on Dec. 7 instead of Sept. 7. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that's what made it a sneak attack. He said, ` If they showed up on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Day </LOCATION>, it would n't have been a surprise.''' _ <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> on a typical <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> photo opportunity: `` He was humming ` My Country Tis of Thee' while <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> spoon-fed him apple pie. _ <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s appeal to Hispanics: `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> is a good man but he's not the most ethnic guy around Somebody asked him what he thought of <LOCATION> Cinco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mayo </LOCATION> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> said, ` Oh, I'll just have regular coffee.' And he had a bad opening. He opened with ` Ich bin ein gringo.''' _ <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> on `` The Top 10 Reasons <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> Would Make a Good President. Among them: `` Would not seem like a brainy egghead when visiting the nation's injured professional wrestlers;'' `` Boyish good looks would cause Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to fall in love, reveal state secrets;'' `` State of the Union Address would be three minutes, tops!''; and `` Impossible to pick himself as VP.'' _ <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s foreign policy expertise: `` He was asked today if he would send military aid to the Straits of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> He said, ` Okay, but the Gays of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> are on their own.''' _ <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' short stature and `` the controversy over whether they should stand during the debate or sit during the debate ... <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> originally wanted squatting.'' _ <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, again, on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' alleged lack of forcefulness: `` Somebody asked him who he's going to vote for and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he was undecided, he was going to wait until after the debate tomorrow.

<HEAD>Falklands Ship Heads For Uruguay In Hopes Of Opening Sea Link</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STANLEY, Falkland Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A cargo ferry slipped out of the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> in an attempt to reopen shipping links with the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> mainland that were ruptured nearly seven years ago. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, which invaded the islands it calls the <LOCATION> Malvinas </LOCATION> in 1982 and was driven out 74 days later by the British, strongly opposes the shipping links. <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> has said it will not cooperate unless neighboring <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> agrees, while <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> says its attitude depends on <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s. The 777-ton Indiana I left <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> harbor without fanfare Thursday carrying 12 passengers, believed to be mostly island businessmen hoping to establish mainland trading links. The vessel is expected to reach the Uruguayan capital of <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION> on Sunday, then head to the southern Chilean town of <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arenas </LOCATION> at the tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> before returning to the remote Falklands. The French-built ship was recently refitted in <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. It is a roll-on, roll-off ferry, meaning vehicles can drive aboard. `` It is not a regular service, which is significant, because we do n't know where demand will come from,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Botterill </PERSON>, manager of the ship. `` We are an international commercial venture and as such can go anywhere in the world we like,'' he told reporters in <LOCATION> Stanley </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botterill </PERSON> said the ship may only sail to <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION> three times a season, while the ship's booking agent, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Swales </PERSON>, said: `` It is not a scheduled service, and is different in that respect to, say, running a ferry link between <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.'' The owners hope to attract business executives interested in saving on freight costs. The present shipping link is with distant <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, 8,000 miles away. The identity of the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> I's owners is not clear, but they are known to be a consortium including British, Japanese, French, Taiwanese, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> and Spanish fishing companies, each of which has invested about $ 260,000. The ship has a British crew, is registered in <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> and flies the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> flag. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> claims sovereignty to the south <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> archipelago. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> rules it as a colony and says sovereignty depends on the wishes of the islanders, who overwhelmingly want to stay British. Attempts to launch Anglo-Argentine negotiations on the islands' future are stalled over <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s demand to put the sovereignty issue on the agenda, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s insistence that sovereignty is non-negotiable

 A West German affiliate of a company here is being investigated as a source of at least one piece of equipment used in a suspected Libyan chemical weapons plant, officials said Thursday night. West German officials are investigating material used in the Libyan factory that may have come from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zink </LOCATION>, a European affiliate of <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zink </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zink </PERSON> President <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the plant at <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, about 35 miles southwest of the Libyan capital of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, is a chemical weapons factory. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has denied the accusation, saying the plant is designed to produce pharmaceuticals. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday night that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officials determined as early as the summer of 1987 that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> had obtained the chemical components of poison gas. Information obtained by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> included the names of companies in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other countries which sold supplies, equipment and expertise to the Libyans, the network said. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> showed film footage of a Zink company sign in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> also has reported that <PERSON> Frankfurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Zink </PERSON> was among a number of companies from which <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> obtained materials for the plant. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Zink </PERSON> officials in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> were informed by West German authorities that the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> affiliate was being investigated. He said it is believed, but had not been confirmed, that a flare manufactured by the company was used in the Libyan plant. `` It's a fairly small part of the plant,'' <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said. `` A typical device used in chemical plants to burn off waste gas.'' The West German government, which had denied that any West German firms were involved with the Libyan plant, announced Thursday that it had found traces of West German complicity in building the factory. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said company records indicate that the flare, valued at about $ 100,000, was to be shipped to a pharmaceutical company in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. `` Whether that actually went to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> or went to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, I just ca n't verify,'' he said. `` We have no proof that it did end up there -LRB- <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> -RRB-. It's early in the discovery process for us.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zink </PERSON> is a worldwide distributor and manufacturer of combustion equipment and environmental control devices, and about half of its equipment is shipped outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s lover testified that he expected to receive the actor's hilltop mansion after <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> died of AIDS in 1985. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, 35, said Thursday that <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> never discussed his will with him, but hinted several times that he would bequeath his <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home to him. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jurors that <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> told him, `` I hope one day you will be able to enjoy this house as much as I have.'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> died of complications from acquired immune deficiency syndrome in February 1985. His 1981 will left all of <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>'s estate to a trust. The mansion was later sold to `` Twilight Zone'' director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> for nearly $ 3 million. Christian, an aspiring musician, filed an $ 11 million lawsuit against <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s estate and his former secretary, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, for failing to tell him <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> had AIDS. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> testified Wednesday that he had unprotected sex with <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> for nine months before learning from television news that the screen idol had the fatal disease. Christian has tested negative for AIDS. However, he is also seeking damages for emotional distress that he claims he continues to suffer because doctors have told him the incubation period for the disease can be 10 years or more. `` When I really think about it and ca n't get it out of my mind, I begin to sweat. At night, I have nightmares that I'll look like <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> did _ like a cadaver,'' <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said. Attorneys for the estate and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> contend <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> stopped having sexual relatiions in February 1984, four months before <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> was diagnosed with the disease. They say <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> filed the lawsuit after he learned he was left out of <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>'s will.

 Under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tenure as commander-in-chief, the military has experienced its largest peacetime buildup. Here, at a glance, are some of the changes that have taken place in the past eight years.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 BUDGET: Annual Pentagon spending in terms of budget authority rose from $ 213.8 billion in fiscal 1982 _ the first full year of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency _ to $ 290.8 billion in fiscal 1989. In all, the administration allocated $ 2.13 trillion to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, an amount that does not include <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> spending on nuclear warheads.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NAVY </ORGANIZATION>: The number of carrier battlegroups has increased from 12 when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office to 15. Modernization programs include purchase of eight Trident submarines, four Nimitz-class aircraft carriers, 33 new Aegis cruisers, 27 nuclear-powered attack submarines, new WASP class amphibious ships, four modernized battleships and two hospital ships. In naval manpower, the service increased its number of petty officers to 54,000 after a shortage of 22,000 in 1981. The administration gained approval for a 600-ship fleet but was forced to scale back its request.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 ARMY: The Army's modernization resulted in purchases of 397 AH-64 Apaches, an all-weather attack helicopter; 924 <ORGANIZATION> Blackhawks </ORGANIZATION>, a modern utility helicopter; 5,350 M-1A1 <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> tanks, and 3,913 <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> fighting vehicles. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> also fielded 416 <ORGANIZATION> MLRS </ORGANIZATION>'s, multiple launcher rocket systems. Under department reorganization, two new light divisions were formed that would allow forces to get to troubled areas quickly. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> also persuaded <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to authorize for the first time in more than a decade a new type of chemical weapon for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpile.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 MARINES: Modernization included purchase of more than 100 AV-8B vertical takeoff attack jets and development of a new air-cushion landing craft for amphibious assaults.

Following the January 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> restarted production lines for several types of unmanned rocket boosters.
</TEXT>

 Studies at five medical centers have found that acyclovir, an antiviral drug, can reduce or eliminate recurrent outbreaks of genital herpes.

Genital herpes is caused by a virus that generally is spread through sexual contact in which one partner has open lesions of the disease.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he would not advocate government action to curtail corporate takeovers but suggested a review of tax laws might be needed to guard against abuses. `` I am not in favor of the government picking winners and losers,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a news conference Thursday to announce his final Cabinet choices. Asked whether he planned action to put the brakes on increasing number of takeovers, many through so-called leveraged buyouts, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` You are talking to one who would as much as possible rely on market forces.'' But he added, that `` if there are abuses of our tax laws, ... the whole tax law will be reviewed to see how they can be eliminated.''

 Officials from the nation's cities say drugs and housing problems worsened in urban America last year, and the shortage of affordable housing is the top hindrance to local economic growth. The National League of Cities, releasing the findings Thursday of its annual survey of local officials, criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for major reductions in housing aid and for proposing to end local assistance to fight drugs. The league, which represents large and small municipalities across the country, surveyed 690 officials in 473 communities last month. Two-thirds of the town officials reported local drug problems had worsened in 1988, and crime was described as worsening by 45 percent.

 Actress <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON> realizes people want to know more about her now that she's starring in several major movies, but that does n't mean she likes it. `` I did n't become an actress so that my life could be exposed,'' <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON> says in an interview in the February issue of Vanity Fair. `` It's really the only thing that makes me contemplate quitting acting.

 A Korean-American businessman was arrested Thursday in an alleged international conspiracy to buy nerve-gas bombs for export from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, possibly to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, officials said. <PERSON> Juwhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Short </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, was accused in a federal complaint of conspiring to violate the Arms Export Control Act by seeking to ship the gas sarin, which attacks the central nervous system causing convulsions and death. `` It was a wide-ranging, trans-Atlantic conspiracy,'' said First Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Chertoff </PERSON>. The arrest came the same day the West German government reversed itself and said it suspected that West German companies helped build a Libyan plant that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes is for manufacturing chemical weapons. The turnaround followed the arrest Wednesday night of a Belgian shipper tied to the case and confirmation by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> that West German firms aided the project. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says the plant is for producing medicine. In the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Chertoff </PERSON> added that at one point in the dealings with <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>, the purported destination was <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> but that this had not been verified. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> negotiated with an undercover customs agent posing as an arms dealer to buy 500 quarter-ton bombs that use sarin, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s office in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON> described the gas as a `` very rapid, odorless, colorless poison which can enter the body by inhalation, absorption or injection.'' <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> was arrested after his wife dropped him off at Customs offices in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> believed he was to meet the undercover arms dealer, <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON> said. If convicted, <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> faces up to five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. He was ordered held without bail by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> pending a hearing Tuesday. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> told the court his <ORGANIZATION> Short </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> home was worth $ 650,000 and that he also owns a $ 400,000 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> condominium. He said he has three children and has been in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for 17 years. According to the federal complaint filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, a seven-month investigation began when an arms procurer, a confidential informant, told Customs that <ORGANIZATION> Komex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of Summit had contacted the informant about buying ammunition for export to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> is identified as president of <ORGANIZATION> Komex </ORGANIZATION>, which sought information on the purchase of 105mm and 106mm ammunition, the complaint said. <PERSON> Chertoff </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Komex </ORGANIZATION> is an import-export concern that had engaged in legitimate arms dealings. On June 27, an undercover agent contacted <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> and said he could provide information about the ammunition. Court papers said the agent taped a July 6 conversation with <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> in which <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> said that four years ago <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> asked <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to deliver 400 <LOCATION> TOW </LOCATION> missiles, electronically guided missiles designed mainly as anti-armor weapons. The agent said that he had 20 TOW II missiles ready for sale. Two weeks later, the agent told <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> he had 500 TOW II missiles available, and <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> said he would make inquiries to find `` some right people'' at the `` right price,'' the complaint said. Authorities said the deal was never completed. The complaint also alleged that <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> asked the undercover agent if he could supply Stinger missiles to the same destination as the TOW's. `` This is believed to be <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' the complaint said. Stingers are portable anti-aircraft missiles. The suspects allegedly also discussed importing Varian tubes, which are power tubes used in military radar systems, the complaint said. Cooperating in the investigation were the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, and French and British customs officials. British officials were involved because according to the complaint on Nov. 27 <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> phoned a Briton, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, who operates <ORGANIZATION> Domino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> if he could obtain 200 to 500 bombs of sarin, the complaint said, and three days later <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> asked the undercover agent if he could obtain the sarin. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> was communicating throughout the alleged negotiations with K.Y. <PERSON> Joo </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Kwang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, the complaint said. French officials entered the investigation when <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> discussed the deal via facsimile with <PERSON> Joo </PERSON>, who was staying in a hotel in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> discussed in other fascimile messages during December the purchase of a minimum of 500 sarin bombs for $ 12,000 each. Authorities said <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> and two other people in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> hotel earlier this month. The identities of the others, who are described in the federal complaint as co-conspirators, were not released. <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> also was charged in the complaint, and <PERSON> Chertoff </PERSON> said officials were discussing whether to extradite him. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> reported in March that a <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> served nine months in prison for plotting to supply gun silencers to a government official in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> through a company known as Domino Avionics. Efforts to reach officials at <ORGANIZATION> Komex </ORGANIZATION> were unsuccessful. A man who answered the telephone at the company's offices declined comment and hung up. Messages were left on a telephone answering machine at <ORGANIZATION> Domino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. Defense Suppliers' offices in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> They were not immediately returned. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> reported that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs officials were investigating an alleged scheme to ship thiodiglycol, a chemical precursor of mustard gas, from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Customs officials filed documents in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> requesting a search warrant for records between <ORGANIZATION> Alcolac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> company that manufactured the chemical, and two companies in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>.

According to a nationwide survey of 10,130 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents, one in 11 blacks said they did n't see a doctor for economic reasons in 1986, compared with one in 20 whites. Blacks were less likely to have health insurance, and those who did were less likely to be covered by private insurance and more likely to live in a state with limited Medicaid benefits, said researchers led by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Their report said 37.2 percent of blacks overall had not seen a doctor in a year, compared with 31.7 percent of whites. The disparity was greater for people in poorer health, with 32.2 percent of blacks going a year without a doctor's care, compared with 17.5 percent of whites, the researchers said. `` There continues to be a lack of parity in access to health care, and a consequent excess of unmet medical needs for blacks compared with whites,'' the authors said. Blacks were more likely than whites to live in one-adult households, perhaps making it harder for them to get to a doctor, the researchers said. `` Blacks were more likely than whites to report that during their last visit, their physician did not inquire sufficiently about pain, did not tell them how long it would take for prescribed medicine to work, did not explain the seriousness of the illness or injury, and did not discuss test or examination findings,'' the study said. This is true despite that blacks, on average, are in poorer health than whites, and continue to have a death rate 1 -LCB- times higher than whites of the same age as well as double the white infant mortality rate, the researchers said. `` Medicine in some ways is no different than getting your car repaired or deciding whether to spend the night in a particular hotel,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, chairman of sociology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and a co-author of the study, said Thursday. `` You're not inclined to do it if past experiences have been negative. Our data suggest there's a greater proportion of negative experiences for blacks and the poor in general than there are for the more affluent among us.'' A related study in the Journal found few blacks included in trials of new drugs. A review of 50 medical studies published from 1984 through 1986 showed that blacks were included in fewer than two-thirds of the tests, said researcher <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Svensson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Svensson </PERSON> said researchers, particularly those from companies that are seeking government approval for new drugs, should include large numbers of blacks in clinical trials to determine if the medications have different effects, based on race. A third study in the Journal examined the treatment of heart-disease patients in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and found that whites had more angiography procedures and heart bypass operations. In angiography, doctors take X-rays of the heart after injecting dye into it, allowing them to determine the extent of blood vessel blockage. The researchers, Drs. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenneker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, were unable to say if their findings were typical nationally, but added their study `` suggests that substantial racial inequalities exist in the use of procedures for patients hospitalized with coronary heart disease.''

 Kind-hearted thieves returned first-grader <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s prized Buffalo Bills flag and gave her some goodies to boot. The 6-year-old girl had proudly displayed the deep blue Bills flag inscribed with the words `` Happy New Year'' under the American flag outside her family's home just north of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> until last weekend, when it disappeared. Whoever took it left a note in the family's mailbox promising to return the flag after the Bills-Bengals American Football Conference Championship game in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> watched Sunday's game, which the Bills lost, on television and thought she spotted the flag in the crowd. She waited and waited, but the flag did n't show up. After news reports about her loss, the family received a mysterious phone call Wednesday evening. The caller instructed the family to look for the flag near a telephone junction box outside their home, said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>. The family found the flag, a case of beer, a thank-you note, a bag and a second note that read, `` We waited till now to return the flag for our own protection -LRB- we thought you'd be watching -RRB-, but we had all intentions of returning your flag. And this is for <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>.'' Inside the bag, to <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>'s surprise and delight, was a game program from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, a shirt, a hat and several other souvenirs from the playoff. `` I still do n't know who took it,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said, `` but they certainly have made my little girl happy.

<HEAD>Researchers Say New Treatment Reverses Bone Loss</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A substance dentists have long used to strengthen teeth is a key part of a new treatment that appears to safely curb spinal osteoporosis, a progressive bone disorder afflicting some 5 million Americans, researchers say. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> researchers on Thursday announced results from a seven-year trial of the new treatment. Doctors say spinal osteoporosis results from a gradual loss of trabecular bone, found primarily in the spine. It most commonly affects elderly women and results in shortened stature, curvature of the back and a protruding abdomen that can cause back pain and digestive discomfort. The treatment employs a slow-release form of sodium fluoride, a compound used by dentists to strenghthen teeth which _ when given with calcium citrate _ can reverse the effects of osteoporosis by adding bone mass, said Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pak </PERSON>, mineral metabolism chief at <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pak </PERSON> said fluoride has been available as an osteoporosis treatment for decades but caused serious side effects, including corrosion of the stomach lining, painful swelling of the joints and stress fractures. `` These complications have precluded the long-range acceptance of use of fluoride in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Pak </PERSON>. `` Our treatments have been designed to overcome these problems.'' In the new treatment, fluoride is encapsulated in a waxy pill that allows it to bypass the stomach before much of the compound is released. That helps alleviate gastrointestinal discomfort and allows the fluoride to be absorbed slowly into the blood, at an effective but not toxic rate, <PERSON> Pak </PERSON> said. Each year, an estimated 500,000 people suffer osteoporosis spine fractures, and a third of women over age 65 will have spinal fractures during their lives, the Southwestern researchers said. `` Treatments such as estrogen and calcium supplements, which are directed at preventing bone loss, are useful in averting the development of osteoporosis when they are applied early, such as during the early postmenopausal period,'' said <PERSON> Pak </PERSON>. `` But they have limited value in patients with established osteoporosis, who have already sustained a substantial bone loss. Our treatment is directed toward the latter group.'' <PERSON> Pak </PERSON> said the treatment, which has been conducted on experimental basis at 10 hospitals around the country, does not reverse spinal curvature or other damage, but does increase bone mass and forestall further breakage. He said it can not be used by people who have sustained hip fractures because of differences in the makeup of hip bones. <PERSON> Pak </PERSON> said he plans to apply to the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in April for approval of the treatment. An <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> review usually takes nine months to 2 -LCB- years, he said. The new drugs promise to increase the availability and usability of osteoporosis treatments, said Dr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Raisz </PERSON>, director of endocrinology and metabolism at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION>. `` Everybody is anxious to have a treatment approved by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Raisz </PERSON> said. The new drugs were developed by <PERSON> Pak </PERSON> and a team of researchers with the help of the <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmacal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. Since 1982, the group has tested the treatment on 251 patients in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. Less than 5 percent of patients at Southwestern experienced gastrointestinal problems when treated with fluoride for an average of 3.5 years, and about 6 percent complained of joint pain. <PERSON> Pak </PERSON> said findings were similar at the other hospitals. Patients' spinal bone mass gained 3 percent to 6 percent each year The studies were sponsored by Southwestern, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> there funded by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arthritis </ORGANIZATION>, Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.

<TEXT>
 Mexican and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are investigating the origin of a cache of Uzi submachine guns and ammunition uncovered in the home of an oil union boss charged with the murder of a federal agent. The oil boss, <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>, said the former mayor of <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION>, across the border from <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, arranged the arms shipment. The ex-mayor is believed to have fled with his family to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to a highly-placed source in the Attorney General's Office. Authorities said 200 submachine guns smuggled in from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were found in the home of <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> when he was arrested Tuesday after a shootout with police in <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madero </LOCATION>, about 220 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Soldiers blew down the door of his home with a bazooka and a federal agent was shot to death in the ensuing gunbattle. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>, among two bodyguards and 48 other jailed associates, was charged Thursday with homicide, weapons possession, importing prohibited weapons and resisting arrest. He faces 40 years in prison if convicted. His associates are to be charged with fraud, weapons possession and tax evasion, judicial authorities say. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>, 66, told investigators that former <ORGANIZATION> Reynosa </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> secretly delivered the Uzis and about 30,000 cartridges on Dec. 10, according to a statement from the Attorney General's Office. The source in the Attorney General's Office said Mexican authorities and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and Drug Enforcement Administration officials met Thursday to try to determine where the arms originated. In a <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> prison Thursday, <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> said, `` They told me my family was kidnapped and if I did n't give a statement that pleased the Federal Attorney General, I would n't see them again.'' He told reporters his detention was `` a dirty, prefabricated infamy.'' Several thousand oil workers and supporters demonstrated for his release Thursday night in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s main plaza. According to the statement, <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> told investigators <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> was accompanied during the arms transaction by <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrego </PERSON>, the police chief of <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The statement did not elaborate. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town's mayor, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vela </PERSON>, said Thursday that the allegations were under investigation. Attempts to reach <PERSON> Abrego </PERSON> by telephone were unsuccessful. But <PERSON> Abrego </PERSON> was quoted Thursday by the official <ORGANIZATION> Excelsior </ORGANIZATION> news agency as saying he had `` nothing to do'' with any arms shipment to <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>. `` On various occasions I went to his house in <PERSON> Ciudad </PERSON> <PERSON> Madero </PERSON>, accompanied by <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>, but I never brought him arms,'' <PERSON> Abrego </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> said he talked with his police chief and that <PERSON> Abrego </PERSON> would continue as head of the 13-member police force. `` If and when anything is proven, we will take the appropriate action,'' <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> said, adding that he was a friend of the former <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION> mayor. `` I find it hard to believe <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> is involved. He's a businessman and does a lot of work with the poor and disadvantaged.'' <PERSON> Hidalgo </PERSON>, with about 3,000 residents, is across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION>, with one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s nine refineries, is a stronghold of oil workers allied with <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>. A bomb threat and rumors of more arrests forced union local chiefs to evacuate the union's national headquarters before they could vote to choose a new secretary-general. The new leader of the 200,000-member union, Sen. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Camero </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardiel </PERSON>, pledged to use `` all legal means to win the freedom of <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>'' and other arrested leaders,'' the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jornada </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Camero </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardiel </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>, who has a history of heart trouble, is under arrest in a hospital. Judicial police showed reporters jewelry valued at more than $ 1.3 million they said was found inside the trunk of <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>'s car The <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, like most of the labor movement, is closely tied to the government. But <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> has a longstanding feud with President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar rose today in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> against the Japanese yen, while stock prices closed at another record high.

 Dribble diplomacy is alive and well as the Israelis topped the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> team in a basketball contest that had more significance off court. While <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had its spell of ping-pong diplomacy in the 1970s when it decided to warm up to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, the Jewish state and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> now seem to be improving relations. At the army sports complex on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s west side, Maccabi of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> held on to beat the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> 97-92, to the joyful shouts of hundreds of Soviet Jews who had the rare opportunity to wave an Israeli flag and proclaim their ancient heritage. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, it was estimated that more than 2 million of the 4.2 million people followed the game in the first live broadcast from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Maccabi held a 71-51 lead with 12 minutes to play but the Soviet team stormed back to within 93-89 on the play of guard <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorin </PERSON> and forward <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarakanov </PERSON>. Rush-hour traffic in major <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> cities was cut to a trickle as people sped home early to watch the game. Israelis gathered in pizzerias and cafes to watch. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s central Mahane Yehuda market closed three hours early. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, not known as a sports buff, viewed the game on a small portable TV set in his office. After <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Barlow </PERSON>, one of four native American players on the Israeli team, wrapped up the game for Maccabi with a short jump shot as the clock wound down, fans rushed into the streets in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, shouting `` We won, we won!'' Bus and taxi drivers honked their horns. Inside the stadium, Soviet Jews hugged and kissed each other. `` This is joy, this is happiness,'' crowed <PERSON> Merab </PERSON> <PERSON> Detrokalashuvili </PERSON>, a 38-year-old Jew from the Soviet Georgian republic. `` The Jewish nation is one nation.'' On the court, the pace had been hectic but with nary an incident, <ORGANIZATION> Maccabi </ORGANIZATION> captain <PERSON> Doron </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamshi </PERSON> and coach <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherf </PERSON> said. Nor was any disturbance reported in the stands or outside. `` Relations are very good,'' a pleased <PERSON> Jamshi </PERSON> said. `` It's like a little war. We won the war and go home happy.'' The team's appearance in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for a European Championship Cup game was the first by an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> team in 15 years. The Soviet team will go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for a rematch in March. It was the first Soviet appearance by an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> basketball team since Israeli participants in the University Games were jeered as they walked into <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> in August 1973. The Kremlin severed diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> following the 1967 Mideast War and it has been only in recent years, under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, that <LOCATION> Soviet-Israeli </LOCATION> relations have shown signs of improving. The visit of Soviet musicians, a leading poet and ordinary Soviet tourists to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have helped. Cultural visits are particularly popular, not leastly because <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has 250,000 immigrants from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said the drawing closer of the two nations is motivated by Soviet desire to play a role in any <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace settlement and the need to convince <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> such a role can be constructive. But for basketball-crazy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and for Soviet Jews chanting `` Maccabi, Maccabi!'' in the stadium and waving blue-and-white banners bearing the Star of <PERSON> David </PERSON>, the game was a joy just in itself. Especially that final score, 97-92. The U.S.-born players on the Israeli team were <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, who has played for Maccabi three years. He first came to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to play briefly in 1977, then returned in 1981. He played at <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Barlow </PERSON> has played for Maccabi for two years after a collegiate career at Notre Dame. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Magee </PERSON> played at <ORGANIZATION> UC-Irvine </ORGANIZATION> and came to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1984 to play for Maccabi. <PERSON> Lavon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> has been with Maccabi one year, and before that he played seven years with <LOCATION> Hapoel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>.

 Leftist guerrillas killed five policemen in an attack northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, bringing to 41 the number of people killed since Saturday in the intensified insurgency, the government said. The attack by the Maoist Shining Path occurred Wednesday near <LOCATION> Huaraz </LOCATION>, 190 miles to the northeast, the government said Thursday. It did not elaborate. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that the guerrillas likely sabotaged a train and caused a crash in the <LOCATION> Andes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> that killed a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> mayor's wife. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Cucci </PERSON> was killed and her husband, <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cucci </PERSON>, was injured Dec. 1 when the rail car they rode derailed and tumbled down a ravine near <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION>, 350 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The announcements came the same day as Prime Minister <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON> and the army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Artemio </PERSON> <PERSON> Palomino </PERSON>, moved to dispel speculation that the military might take over the government. President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> is widely blamed for mismanaging <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s fragile economy and causing a severe recession, marked by record high inflation last year of 1,722 percent, and for failing to curb the 8-year guerrilla insurgency `` The nation and the armed forces are united. There is no danger of a military coup,'' <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Palomino </PERSON> said talk of a coup was without credibility. Vice President <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> and former President <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Belaunde </PERSON> also issued statements in recent days denying a coup was afoot and appealing for calm.

Last week, a Peruvian judge issued a restraining order indefinitely suspending a three-year Soviet-Peruvian accord, which permits 20 Soviet trawlers to annually catch 400,000 tons of mainly mackerel and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> hake inside <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s 200-mile limit. Fishermen argued that the contract provided unjust profits to the Soviets. The government responded by soliciting another court order barring 50 Peruvian fishing boats from leaving their home port of <LOCATION> Paita </LOCATION>, 600 miles north of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, until the contract dispute is resolved. The <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comercio </ORGANIZATION> said nearly all of Paita's fishing boats, which supply more than half of the fish consumed domestically, began a sympathy strike Tuesday. Fishing is one of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s most important industries and more than 4 million tons of fish are caught yearly. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> exports nearly $ 300 million worth of fishmeal annually, the Ministry of Fishing said.

<HEAD>Signs Of Homeless Students Prompt School-Based Shelters</HEAD>

 A 12-year-old girl who had been sleeping under an abandoned house was the first to seek shelter at a public school in a new program that offers homeless students a refuge from the chilly streets. `` Right now she's playing checkers with one of the administrators,'' said school board President <PERSON> Melody </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>. `` We just tried to give her encouragement and let her play.'' Public school officials opened shelters at two schools Thursday night to provide needy students with beds, showers and hot meals. The 12-year old, who was not identified, was the only one of eight children who stayed at the shelters on the first night who met the guidelines for the Schoolhouse Shelters program, officials said. A mother brought five children to a shelter, and two teen-agers who sought refuge gave names of schools outside <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` If only one child shows up, the program's working because that's one child that's not on the streets,'' says area schools Superintendent <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Stripling </PERSON>. `` I'm not disappointed,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said. `` It's going to take some time for the children to build up a trust factor with us, and you can imagine how frightened these poor little children are with all this attention.'' Four other boys who came to a shelter decided to leave because they feared the attention they might draw, said officials who tried unsuccessfully to discourage reporters from staking out the shelter. Officials in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> school district, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' largest with about 190,000 students, set up the shelters after increasing reports of students living on the streets. <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> has an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 homeless people, but it's uncertain how many are children. The program is based on the premise that students who feared seeking help elsewhere might turn to a more familiar environment _ school. Under the program's guidelines, only students enrolled in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> schools are eligible to stay in the shelters, which are not meant for families or children who should be served by other social programs. One of the two schools is set up to handle children from kindergarten through the eighth grade. The other is intended for high school students. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> donated 75 cots and blankets, and area residents volunteered to drive the streets in search of children needing shelter. The cost to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> schools, which provided food, space and security officers, was described as minimal. The program will remain in effect at the two schools until at least Jan. 20, when the superintendent will recommend to the school board that it be continued or modified. Despite general support from social agencies, some officials have doubts about how severe the problem is. Programs already exist for `` truly homeless'' children, said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Children's Protective Services. But supporters of Schoolhouse Shelters disagreed, saying a cold front that swept through <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Thursday evening may help prove the necessity of the program. Balmy afternoon temperatures dipped to a windy 40 degrees by late evening. `` These children do not have homes,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said. `` We have incidences reported where children have left school and gone home to find that there is nobody there anymore.''

<HEAD>Rightist Severs Finger To Protest Corruption</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A political scandal involving leading government officials has prompted one irate citizen to protest by chopping off part of a finger and mailing it to the prime minister, police said today. A member of a rightist organization admitted severing the top of his little finger on the right hand and sending it to Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, along with a message protesting political corruption, a police official said. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 47-year-old protester was a member of an extreme rightist group. But he refused to identify him `` because the act was obviously aimed at seeking publicity.'' The protester included a return address on the package, the official said. A package containing the finger was delivered to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s official residence on Tuesday with a letter describing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s leaders as `` dirty politicians'' involved in a stock-profiteering scandal, the official Scores of politicians and business leaders were offered the opportunity to buy unlisted stocks of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a real estate subsidiary, and then reaped hefty profits after public trading began. The scandal has led to the resignation of two Cabinet ministers and 16 others from the top echelons of the bureaucracy, business and news media. A relative and aide to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> also have been implicated, but the prime minister maintains he was not personally involved. The rightist was also quoted as saying in his protest message: `` I urge you to reflect gravely -LRB- on the situation -RRB- at the beginning of a new era.'' Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> died at age 87 on Saturday and his eldest son <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> immediately succeeded to the throne. Police said there were no plans to file charges against the protester, a resident of the <LOCATION> Saitama </LOCATION> region near <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and a member of a right-wing group known as Kokuyukai, or `` concern for the country group.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s rightist groups often drive around cities in military-style jeeps and trucks, blaring recorded marching songs and anti-communist slogans. Many extreme rightists advocate revision of the pacifist constitution to re-militarize <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and restore the emperor to his pre-World War II status as a living god.

 Army officials knew or should have known about health and safety hazards threatening civilian workers at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Military Academy that prompted inspectors to cite 156 violations, a federal official says. Of the violations found by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, 107 were classified as `` serious,'' meaning they held a `` substantial probability that death or serious injury can result,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomich </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> regional director, said Thursday. <PERSON> Tomich </PERSON> said he was uncertain whether any serious injuries had resulted from the violations, which included bare electrical wires, a chlorine gas hazard and unsafe machines. The military also clearly knew about 30 additional problems but failed to make a `` reasonable'' effort to rectify them, <PERSON> Tomich </PERSON> said. In some cases, academy officials had hoped to remove the hazards but may have been hampered by budgetary restraints, <PERSON> Tomich </PERSON> said. `` A lot of the violations have to do with basic safety,'' said <PERSON> Tomich </PERSON>, whose <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> office headed the investigation. `` For whatever purpose ... the conditions were allowed to exist. We were surprised at the number of violations and the severity of them.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> officials said the report, which was sent to the academy this week, still had to be reviewed by the school's superintendent, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, and they declined comment <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s August 1988 probe was the first time the federal safety enforcement agency had investigated West Point. The <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> team was dispatched after the academy's occupational accident rate rose above the national average for the first time in 1988, <PERSON> Tomich </PERSON> said. The national average was 2.79 accidents per 100 workers a year. <PERSON> Tomich </PERSON> said it was 3.85 at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>. Besides 3,800 civilian employees, 4,400 cadets and 1,600 military personnel are at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, said academy spokeswoman <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamburger </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> is only authorized to investigate civilian worksites. <PERSON> Tomich </PERSON> said fewer than half of those were inspected at the academy, and the sites chosen were considered `` high hazard'' areas. `` The thing that we were surprised at was the sheer numbers that we had here,'' <PERSON> Tomich </PERSON> said. `` We had 80 or 90 pages of citations, which is not your normal case. And that's not even going into the entire facility wall to wall.'' Among the violations found by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>: _ At the cadet gym, the academy failed to properly separate tanks of sodium hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid near the pool The combination of the two chemicals would create dangerous chlorine gas, <PERSON> Tomich </PERSON> said, adding, `` The potential for them to mix was there.'' _ Inadequate ventilation at the indoor rifle and pistol range created a potentially dangerous exposure to lead particles from bullets _ Many machines failed to have adequate safeguards against a worker getting caught in the apparatus <PERSON> Tomich </PERSON> said there was `` risk of amputation.'' _ Numerous cases where electrical wiring was either exposed or unsuitable <PERSON> Tomich </PERSON> said employees risked coming in contact with live wires and being electrocuted. _ Elevated working platforms failed to have guardrails _ Many exits were padlocked, violating fire safety codes Despite failing to address these problems, <PERSON> Tomich </PERSON> said he detected no `` blatant disregard'' for civilian safety. In many cases, he said, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials `` basically just transferred that information onto a notice of unsafe condition and posted it in the area but never corrected it.''

<HEAD>Head Of Government Inquiry Into Aboriginal Deaths Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of a government probe on the deaths of 104 aborigines in police custody has resigned, and indigenous activists today called the decision a devastating blow to the inquiry. Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Muirhead </PERSON>, federal court judge since 1977, resigned late Thursday to become administrator of the Northern Territory. Aboriginal groups called the decision a blow to their cause and expressed concern that the inquiry, set up in 1987 to investigate 44 aboriginal deaths in police custody since 1980, could be downgraded. Since the inquiry began, the number of aboriginal deaths in police custody has grown to 104, and <PERSON> Muirhead </PERSON> had said the increased number would extend his work _ expected to be completed last month _ two years minimum. Aboriginal activists have charged police brutality as the cause. An interim report issued last month recommended aboriginal recruits replace white police officers suspected of racism and that drunkenness be abolished as a crime for aborigines. Most aborigines have died in police cells by hanging after being picked up on charges of being drunk and disorderly. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said <PERSON> Muirhead </PERSON>, who also was the judge in the <PERSON> Lindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> trial, would continue in his job until April. The Chamberlain trial was the basis for the recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> movie starring Meryl Streep entitled `` A Cry in the Dark.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defend </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, which represents many of the families of aborigines who have died in custody, urged the federal government ensure that justice is not denied the country's indigenous population following <PERSON> Muirhead </PERSON>'s resignation Aborigines, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s original inhabitants, number about 160,000, or 1 percent of the 16 million population. Government figures statistics show aborigines are socially and economically deprived. Aboriginal activists declared last year's Bicentennial marking European settlement a year of mourning. <PERSON> Muirhead </PERSON>, 63, said aborigines should not fear the probe will wind down. `` I think the commission is well established,'' he said. No replacement was immediately named.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has evidence implicating West German companies in the construction of a Libyan chemical factory and indicating that the plant began test production of poison gas, according to news reports. Intelligence sources said a toxic spill occurred during an attempt to make poison gas in August and led to frantic phone calls to West German companies for clean-up help, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. Imhausen-Chemie, a chemical company whose officials have denied any connection with the disputed plant, was one of those the Libyans called for help, the TV network's news said. Officials, in confirming the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> report to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, said the evidence included extensive intercepts of telephone conversations between the Libyans and their suppliers. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has charged that the plant at <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, about 35 miles southwest of the Libyan capital of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, is a chemical weapons factory. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has denied the accusation, saying the plant is designed to produce drugs. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officials determined as early as summer 1987 that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> had obtained the chemical components of poison gas. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was able to compile detailed evidence of the Libyan operation through electronic eavesdropping, satellite surveillance and the use of spies in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> reported. The information obtained included the names of companies in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other countries which sold supplies, equipment and expertise to the Libyans. Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> also reported that a chemical spill occurred at the plant in August. The West German government had denied any German firms were involved with the Libyan plant, but Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> announced Thursday that authorities had seized documents that may show West German companies helped build the plant.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> charged that <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> military authorities arrested at least three Burmese students shortly after <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> forced them to return home. A 21-year-old student taken into military custody in a separate case died two days after his release, apparently from harsh treatment in detention, the London-based human rights organization said. The statement, dated Thursday, was received by telex in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> today, a day after another <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> statement accused <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> military authorities of forcibly repatriating 22 students who fled <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> after a bloody military coup in September. Thai officials said they returned voluntarily. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> today announced it would suspend a $ 7.4 million grant to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> because it is under military rule. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it has not recognized Gen. <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, who seized power after a bloody September coup, as <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s legitimate leader. The latest <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> statement said that according to the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> state radio, two students repatriated Saturday, <PERSON> Sao </PERSON> <PERSON> Myo </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moe </PERSON>, were arrested shortly after their return and taken into military custody for questioning. Amnesty previously said the two students had taken leading roles in the August and September demonstrations for democracy in Shan state. The statement said other reports indicated authorities arrested a third student Saturday, <PERSON> Tu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ain </PERSON> <PERSON> Tin </PERSON>, who had become popular among demonstrators for performing pro-democracy songs. The statement said <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> also was concerned that another pro-democracy demonstrator, Zaw Win Tin of the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, reportedly died Dec. 30, `` less than 48 hours after he was released from military custody.'' `` He had been arrested several weeks earlier and had apparently been held incommunicado without charge or trial since then,'' <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said. `` He is said to have died from the effect of the severe ill treatment he sustained while in prison.'' Amnesty has reported many Burmese arrested for involvement in the pro-democracy campaign have been held without charge or trial and that some have been tortured or otherwise harshly treated. Students led last year's nationwide demonstrations for democracy in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> until <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> took power Sept. 18. His troops cleared the streets by killing hundreds of unarmed demonstrators. Thousands of students fled to Thai border areas controlled by anti-government guerrillas, seeking refuge and in some cases, military training. Thai officials have said about 7,000 remain at the border. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> at first promised the students temporary asylum but then <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> chief Gen. <PERSON> Chavalit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongchaiyudh </PERSON> broke an international campaign to isolate <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s government and reached an agreement with <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> to send the students home. <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s government promised no action against the students and denied accusations of arrests and harsh treatment. Under the program, the students are brought to Tak in northern <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and then flown to <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> aboard <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> military aircraft. Seventy-six students returned Thursday, bringing to 260 the number who have returned under the program, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials said.

 Thousands of truckers and air travelers were stranded and up to 100,000 residents lost power as <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds tore through <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> at up to 100 mph, officials said. The winds closed <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> for 10 hours Thursday, shredded one of the world's largest blimps and damaged an airliner there and toppled at least a dozen tractor-trailer rigs in <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol Sgt. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Joy </PERSON>. `` It's kind of an intense feeling,'' said trucker <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Derringer </PERSON>, who sat out the winds at an <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> truck stop. `` You become kind of a devout Catholic or whatever you are real quick.'' The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anas </LOCATION> _ also called `` devil winds'' _ are spun off by high pressure inland and pick up speed as they move from <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s deserts through mountain passes and roar down on adjacent communities.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher On West German Comments, Gold Off Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar rose in European trading this morning as the market continued to react positively to comments in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by West German Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON>, dealers said. The stronger dollar depressed gold prices slightly. Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar surged in <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> dealings and continued to rise in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in response to <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> saying he would like to see the dollar remain at around 1.80 West German marks. Dealers in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> said the market's rally was being curbed by fears of central bank intervention. A trader with the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> branch of a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial bank expressed surprise at the strength of the dollar's rally so far this year, spurred mainly by high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates. `` Let's not forget that the dollar has risen without the benefit of a long-expected hike in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> discount rate,'' she said. The discount rate is the interest rate charged by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> on loans to commercial banks. But another trader in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> said the primary motive behind the dollar's rally is speculation. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> still has a big trade deficit and says it wants a lower dollar. The west Germans have a huge trade surplus and want a stronger mark. But the dollar surges and the mark falls,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.53 yen to a closing 126.65 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted higher at 126.75 yen. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Thursday: _ 1.8375 West German marks, up from 1.8355 _ 1.5680 Swiss francs, up from 1.5510 _ 6.2705 French francs, up from 6.2150 _ 2.0743 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0590 _ 1,350.50 Italian lire, up from 1,339.50 _ 1.2000 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1957 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.7730, compared Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 403.50 a troy ounce and at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed the same recommended price.

<TEXT>
 An accused killer whose $ 100,000 bail was revoked last year after he allegedly threatened a witness was allowed to leave jail based on forged court papers that showed a new bail of $ 10,000, officials said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, 35, whose 1983 conviction in the murder of an elderly pharmacist and a customer at a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> drugstore was overturned on a technicality, left <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> jail Dec. 17, but officials only found out Thursday when he failed to appear in court for his retrial, said <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryles </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. She said a woman, whose name was not released, had paid the $ 10,000 bail in cash. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>' lawyer, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiswasser </PERSON>, said he learned of the escape when he walked into <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Thursday and Justice <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Aiello </PERSON> asked him where his client was. `` I thought the judge was kidding me,'' he said. Authorities then discovered that legal papers had been doctored to show that <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>'s status had been changed from no bail to $ 10,000 bail, said <PERSON> Ryles </PERSON>. `` I was shocked and the clerk was quite upset because it was his signature that had been forged,'' said <PERSON> Weiswasser </PERSON>. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> and two co-defendants were convicted of second-degree murder in the Dec. 12, 1982 shooting deaths of <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Scher </PERSON>, 73, and 34-year-old <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGennaro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> and the other two were sentenced to prison, with <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> getting 50 years to life. He was released on $ 100,000 bail, however, after his conviction was overturned on a technicality in December 1987, <PERSON> Ryles </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> was sent back to jail and his bail was revoked last September after a witness in the case reported being threatened, according to a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> district attorney's office.

<TEXT>
 The non-aligned movement today recognized an official as representing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s declared state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> at the opening of a conference called to modernize the 101-member organization. The head of the political department of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadoumi </PERSON>, received a warm welcome. Foreign Minister <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacovou </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> descended from the podium to hug him. <PERSON> Kadoumi </PERSON>, considered the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s foreign minister, told the meeting of foreign ministers the non-aligned movement can not lose sight of its goal of `` ending colonialism.'' It was the first such high-level meeting of the non-aligned movement since the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> declared an independent Palestinian state in November. About 90 countries, most from the non-aligned movement, have recognized <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Kadoumi </PERSON> thanked them for their support. He expressed `` gratitude for the role of the non-aligned movement in strengthening the militancy of our <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> people'' in trying to establish a state in territory occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamuyaria </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> read a message from President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, the head of the non-aligned movement, calling for a permanent headquarters for the organization. Iacovou, in his opening address, said the conference was designed to `` make suggestions as to how the movement will become more effective and more dynamic.'' At the foreign ministers' conference held in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> in September, delegates complained the organization was bloated, churning out endless documents that nobody read and adopting resolutions nobody followed. The conference on updating the movement emerged from those complaints. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Narasimha </PERSON> <PERSON> Rao </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> said the movement `` is at a crossroads. One road leads to irrelevance, the other to the role it has played in contributing new ideas to international problems.'' The non-aligned movement, founded in 1961, initially was designed to represent countries that did not want to choose sides in the U.S.-Soviet superpower rivalry.

 Two teen-agers were in serious condition and 40 other children and three adults were injured after a school bus driven by a man with a suspended sentence collided with a coal truck, officials said. Bus driver <PERSON> Enoch </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 33, had his license suspended for failing to report to traffic school after receiving a speeding ticket Aug. 25, Patrolman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Shackelford </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> had paid a fine for the ticket, the patrolman said. Police cited <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> for driving with a suspended license, a misdemeanor, at a hospital where he was treated and released for minor injuries. A court date was n't set. The accident occurred at a rain-drenched intersection at the entrance of <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Thursday afternoon, said Capt. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Truck driver <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>, 28, who suffered cuts and bruises, attempted to swerve to avoid the bus as it crossed the intersection in his path, but he jackknifed and hit the bus at an angle, <PERSON> Shackelford </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shackelford </PERSON> said the truck was empty. `` If the truck had been loaded, it would have cut the bus in two,'' he said. Witnesses said the bus might not have come to a complete stop at the intersection, where it faced a stop sign and a flashing red light, but police had not confirmed the reports, <PERSON> Shackleford </PERSON> said. `` There was a tremendous amount of screaming and crying,'' said <PERSON> Hollon </PERSON>, who arrived moments after the crash. `` Some of the students were pinned in together. I saw one instance where one of the students was trying to help the other, even though they both were pinned in.'' Two 13-year-old boys, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Detherage </PERSON>, were in serious and stable condition today at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Colliver </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> suffered abdominal and other injuries and underwent surgery Thursday night. <PERSON> Detherage </PERSON> suffered head injuries and multiple lacerations and was in the pediatric intensive care unit.

<HEAD>CDC Recommends Changes In Vaccinations For Measles, Which Isn't Going
Away</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A decade after predicting measles was on the verge of eradication, federal health officials have proposed two new steps to try to wipe out the disease. The recommendations, issued Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, could mean an extra measles shot for thousands of infants and older children. According to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, the major outbreaks of measles in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in recent years have occurred among infants under the 15-month vaccination age and among school-age children who have been vaccinated but got measles anyway. As many as 10 percent of all vaccinations fail to provide the intended protection. To try to stop the outbreaks, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Immunization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Practices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has recommended: _ Infants younger than 15 months, in areas where recurrent measles is a problem, should get two measles shots instead of one _ a shot of measles vaccine alone at 9 months, and a second dose at 15 months in the commonly used measles-mumps-rubella vaccine _ In schools experiencing outbreaks and in nearby schools where the disease might spread, all students whose measles shots came before 1980 should be revaccinated, along with their siblings That 1980 cutoff was chosen because vaccinations before then may not have been as effective either because the vaccine subsequently was improved or because the vaccinations came earlier in life according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy at the time, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. In the late 1970s, <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> measles specialists believed the once common childhood disease could be eradicated by fall 1982. But that goal was not met; from 1983 to 1988, between 1,497 and 6,282 measles cases have been reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year. Dr. <PERSON> Sonja </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchins </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> measles specialist, could not predict how many children would be affected by the new recommendations, adding, `` We're in the process of analyzing that now.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s recommendations are not binding on local health and education officials, but are widely recognized as health policy in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Local health officials will be responsible for monitoring measles in their communities and spreading the word about the new recommendations, Ms. <PERSON> Hutchins </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s immunization committee is recommending the two-dose routine for infants in any county that has had five preschool measles cases in each of the previous five years, and is urging revaccination of certain students at any high school or college where an outbreak is taking place or might spread from a nearby school. About one in 10 counties reported at least one measles case in 1987. More than 800 cases occurred in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> alone, another 469 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 452 in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and 318 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The nation's measles-eradication strategy, which stresses vaccination of infants, surveillance for measles and aggressive outbreak control, is unchanged, Ms. <PERSON> Hutchins </PERSON> said. `` These three elements are still important,'' she said. `` These two major recommendations are modifications to the current strategy.'' The two modifications come with alternatives, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. In affected areas where a two-dose infant schedule is n't possible, vaccination should come at 12 months, not 15, the agency said And if a school fighting a measles outbreak ca n't revaccinate all students whose shots came before 1980, it should at least target students vaccinated before the age of 15 months.

<HEAD>Chinese `Baby Boom' Outstripping Food Supply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The world's most populous country is growing faster than the food supply, threatening <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic development unless authorities enforce strict birth control policies, official reports said today. `` If we do n't strictly control the baby boom, more difficulties will be passed on to succeeding generations,'' <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> <PERSON> Peiyun </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, told about 6,000 people gathered Thursday night at the Great Hall of the People. She was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. `` The population increase will gobble up all the economic gains each year unless it is put under strict control,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xitong </PERSON> as saying. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will have 1.1 billion people by April, Ms. <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> told the meeting. She did not announce the birth rate for 1988, but disclosed that 1987's rate was 2.3 percent, higher than the 2 percent previously announced for the year. The recent barrage of official lectures on family planning may indicate that last year's rate was higher still. The official goal is 1.5 percent growth or lower. To achieve that goal, since the early 1980s the government has limited most families to only one child. But in the past few years more and more families have ignored the limit, and the state also has seemed to relax the policy. Last year, it said rural couples whose first child was a girl would be allowed to have a second to try for a son to work on the land. However, the combination of soaring population and stagnant grain harvests has heightened anxiety among officials. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said the rapid growth rate means per capita grain supplies will remain about even even if overall grain production is increased 25 percent to 1.1 trillion pounds by the year 2000. However, a decline in per capital grain supplies seems likely because agriculture officials recently said it will be virtually impossible to reach that goal by 2000. Population projections for 2000 are going higher and higher. The target is 1.2 billion, but family planning authorities said last year it more likely would reach 1.27 or 1.28 billion. The Economic Daily predicted Tuesday that it would hit 1.32 billion if it continues growing at its current pace. Enforcement of the general one-child policy varies widely from one area to another. Cities are the most strict, with most workers facing fines and possible dismissal if they have a second child. But in some rural areas, farmers have become prosperous enough to be able to afford the fines.

 <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, the live-in companion of alleged child killer <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, did not require psychiatric hospitalization after the beating death of the couple's daughter, a psychiatrist testified. Dr. <PERSON> Azariah </PERSON> <PERSON> Eshkenazi </PERSON>, testifying for the defense, said Thursday that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> could benefit from outpatient psychiatric care but that in November 1987 she was oriented and coherent with `` absolutely no thought disorder.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, is accused of fatally beating the couple's illegally adopted, 6-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> His lawyers have tried to shift the blame onto Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46, who has spent the past year in a psychiatric facility. The defense has argued that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> is a `` malingerer'' who remains hospitalized to win sympathy and avoid prosecution. She was charged with <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> in the girl's death, but charges were dropped and she became the government's star witness. Prosecutors said she was so physically and emotionally battered by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> that she was unable to harm <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. `` I did not find any mental disorder that would require her to be psychiatrically hospitalized,'' testified <PERSON> Eshkenazi </PERSON>, head of mental health services for women prisoners at <ORGANIZATION> Elmhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. He said he based his opinion on reports of two other <LOCATION> Elmhurst </LOCATION> psychiatrists and his 45-minute interview with Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> 10 days after her arrest.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised a Cabinet of `` new faces'' but his final team more closely resembles a group photograph of old-timers from previous Republican administrations. The president-elect completed his selections on Thursday by naming retired Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> as energy secretary and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> as drug czar. The two are typical of other <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appointments. Both have previous top-level government experience: <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s education secretary and <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> as chief of naval operations and chairman of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidential commission on AIDS. In the past, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` stay tuned'' when he was asked about those new faces. But now that the lineup is complete, the new faces are hard to pick out. The president-elect told reporters en route to a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> fishing weekend today that it was a matter of defining old and new. `` I never pledged that I would have a totally inexperienced Cabinet,'' he said. `` There's a lot of new faces in the Cabinet. It depends how you define new _ new from the old -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration -RRB- Cabinet, not new from having no experience in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I want an experienced Cabinet. That's exactly what we've got.'' Nearly all the top-level positions in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will be filled by people who, like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, are middle-aged, middle-of-the road Republicans. Most, like him, have resumes long in years of government service. Seven members of his new team served in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Cabinet and two are retiring Republican lawmakers In fact, of the government's 14 principal Cabinet agencies, only three will be headed by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> outsiders: <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> educator <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> mass transit official <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> at Transportation. Asked where the rest of the new faces are, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides have suggested they'll be at sub-Cabinet levels of government. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself has insisted that his Cabinet does have its share of new faces _ or at least old faces in new jobs. `` I set a goal for a broad-based Cabinet, experienced people, experienced people,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview earlier this week with <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think we've got it. They're giving me a hit a little on ` new faces.' These are new faces. ... When I said new faces, I did n't mean I was going to reach out and find everybody with no experience in government.'' Three members of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new Cabinet are direct holdovers from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s _ <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> as attorney general, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> as treasury secretary and <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> as education secretary. He also announced that <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> and presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> would keep their jobs. Eight other top-level <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appointees once held Cabinet or other high-level posts under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. They include: <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>; <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>; former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice for labor secretary; former Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, chosen for agriculture secretary; and former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, to be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s secretary of state. Also: <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, an undersecretary of state who was chosen as secretary of veterans affairs; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, a former deputy treasury secretary who will be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget director; and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> who will be <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picked two retiring veterans of the House for his Cabinet: former rival <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for housing and urban development, and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for interior. And he reached into pre-Reagan <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> administrations for two of his selections, picking <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, who had been <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary in the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administration, as his trade representative; and naming <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> as national security adviser, the same job he'd held under <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. Three sub-Cabinet posts filled by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> do qualify as newcomers, however: New Hampshire Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> as his chief of staff; <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> as chief White House economist; and conservationist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. In all, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Cabinet contains one black -LRB- <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> -RRB-, two Hispanics -LRB- <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> -RRB-, and two women -LRB- <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> -RRB-. And what advice did <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> give his new team? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with them Thursday evening. But before the event, he told reporters his advice would include `` think big.'' And, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added, `` I'm going to tell them I do n't like ` kiss and tell' books.''

 A British Tornado warplane flew into a group of eight West German jet fighters today and collided with two of them, killing the two British crewmen and injuring a German pilot, officials said. Several houses were slightly damaged on the edge of the northern village of <LOCATION> Wiesmoor </LOCATION> by debris from the Tornado but there were no civilian casualties, local police said. The Tornado crashed into a field just outside Wiesmoor, while one German plane came down a few miles away, the defense spokesman said. The other plane involved in the crash managed to land safely, he said. The pilot of the German jet that crashed was injured, he said. The accident came amid growing complaints among the West German public about the dangers to civilians from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> training flights over this densely populated country. More than 100 people were killed in military-related plane crashes last year in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. A spokesman at the West German <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> said the British plane flew into a group of eight German Alfajet fighters preparing to land at <LOCATION> Wittmund </LOCATION> air base near <LOCATION> Wiesmoor </LOCATION>, 50 miles northwest of the port city of <LOCATION> Bremen </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who asked not to be identified by name, said the Tornado plane collided with two of the Alfajets. Earlier reports indicated the British plane crashed with only one German fighter. A spokesman at the British forces headquarters in <LOCATION> Rheindahlen </LOCATION> confirmed the Tornado had crashed after the collision, killing the two-man British crew. `` We can confirm that a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Tornado jet from No. 14 Squadron at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base <LOCATION> Brueggen </LOCATION> crashed near the village of <LOCATION> Wiesmoor </LOCATION>, killing the pilot and the navigator,'' the spokesman said. <LOCATION> Brueggen </LOCATION> is near the West German border with the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, 210 miles south of the crash site. The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Tornado was on a routine training mission when it crashed. A Wiesmoor police spokesman said the injured German pilot had been taken to a nearby hospital. It was not immediately clear whether the pilot sustained his injuries while ejecting from the airplane. Identities of the British crew killed in the crash `` will not be released pending notification of next of kin,'' the British forces spokesman said. He said a team of experts was traveling to the scene to investigate the crash. In the worst military crash in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> last year, 70 people died after three <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> air force stunt jets collided during an air show at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> that was attended by thousands of people. The last major <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plane crash occurred on Dec. 8, when a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> A-10 Thunderbolt slammed into a residential neighborhood in the city of <LOCATION> Remscheid </LOCATION>, killing the pilot and five people on the ground. The West German <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> is expected next week to submit a report on ways to reduce military aircraft training flights.

<HEAD>Human Rights Accord Accepted With New East Bloc Freedoms</HEAD>

CLARIFY that final accord possible this week. No pickup. ^By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 A conference of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and Western nations today informally accepted a landmark accord on human rights and security, diplomats said. The pact calls for freedom of travel and religion in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. However, a Greek-Turkish dispute still blocked a final agreement among the 35 nations that is to include a mandate for new European talks on conventional weapons, said the diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity. If the deadlock is broken, a final pact could be signed on Saturday, they said. The disagreement between <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> over a Turkish port in the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> has prevented negotiators from the 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and seven <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations from approving the new East-West talks on reducing conventional troops and weapons across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Twelve non-aligned nations are also attending the conference. Agreement on the human rights and security accord came after more than two years of tough East-West bargaining at the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> review conference, which opened in November 1986. A copy of the accord, obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, showed landmark agreements on the freedom of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc citizens to travel, practice religion and monitor their countries' compliance with human rights. Western diplomats called the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> document a milestone. Its key test, however, will be whether the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies actually stick to the new commitments. The pact `` refined and defined the humanitarian undertakings in far greater detail than ever possible before,'' said <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>. He and other Western diplomats said reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> played a major role in securing the agreement. The diplomats also said the human rights provisions contained in the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> document are more specific than any others since the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> process began with the signing of the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act in 1975. The document also provides a mechanism by which any two of the signatories can raise human rights issues. Western diplomats described that agreement as a major achievement. The conference is scheduled to wind up next week with a three-day closing ceremony attended by foreign ministers from all the signatories of the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act: the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and all European nations except <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. But that ceremony was put in jeopardy today because of the failure to break the deadlock between <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. If the impasse is broken, a final document could be accepted in a public meeting on Saturday, diplomats said. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> agreed with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Mersin </LOCATION>, which is close to Syrian border, should be excluded from the new East-West arms talks. But <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> insists the port must be considered. It says <LOCATION> Mersin </LOCATION> is a key port for shipping supplies to northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, which is controlled by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. The rest of the island is controlled by <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. Greek Ambassador <PERSON> Evangelos </PERSON> <PERSON> Frangoulis </PERSON> denied at a news conference today that <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> raised its objections at the last minute. He said <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> would be happy to put aside the issue until the <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> arms talks open, probably in March. Diplomats say, however, that <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> will not accept this compromise. In an attempt to break the deadlock, the 35-nation conference worked into the night Thursday. A draft document presented on behalf of the non-aligned nations early today was informally accepted by caucuses of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact and the 12 nations of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, diplomats said. The only outstanding human rights issue remained <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s acceptance of a controversial human rights conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1991 <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> envoy, said this morning he expected firm assurances from the Soviets during the day that they would permit a <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> couple waiting for 10 years for exit visas to emigrate. He indicated that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> would then agree to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> conference.

<HEAD>Hopkins Researchers Develop Process To `See' Thoughts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Using electrodes connected to a monkey's brain, scientists at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> say they have produced a computer image of the brain as it thinks. `` We have visualized a thought process, a mental transformation,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Apostolos </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgopoulos </PERSON>, a neuroscientist and leader of the research team. `` We've used a technique that lets a mental process be seen as a physical one.'' The team's study, published today in Science magazine, found that nerve cells of the motor cortex, the part of the brain that controls movement, can be tracked during the thinking that precedes purposeful movement. The findings might someday help scientists develop artificial limbs that respond electronically to the brain's instructions, <PERSON> Georgopoulos </PERSON> said. Experiments on a trained rhesus monkey named Lambda demonstrated that mental calculations showed up on the computer screen thousandths of a second before the animal performed a task. <PERSON> Georgopoulos </PERSON> has worked since 1980 to decipher the electrical brain activity that determines how an animal responds to stimulus, such as a shining light. `` We know that the brain analyzes the situation and has to produce a movement that will be appropriate for the situation, with the appropriate direction in space,'' <PERSON> Georgopoulos </PERSON> said. `` So we ask the animal to make that movement, and we record the activity of the brain and see how the cells interrelate.'' Using a clock-like device with a circle of light bulbs, scientists taught Lambda to move a metal handle to a right angle to whichever light was turned on. <PERSON> Georgopoulos </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lambda </PERSON>, coaxed with rewards of banana juice, learned to respond correctly more than 80 percent of the time. Electrodes implanted into the monkey's cortex picked up the electrical activity of the cortical cells that control arm movement. The impulses were relayed to a computer and interpreted into images of vectors, or directional forces. The computer graphics showed that milliseconds after the light flashed on, the electrical activity in those cells displayed a tendency to `` think'' in the direction of the light. The vectors then rotated in that direction. `` This, I believe, is the first time one can infer something about the psychological processes of the brain,'' <PERSON> Georgopoulos </PERSON> said. `` You can look at the brain and see there's a rotation.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighter jets buzzed a Libyan commercial airliner flying from <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> news agency said today. The report, citing a statement by the Secretariat of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>, said the incident occurred Tuesday after the <ORGANIZATION> Libyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 had left <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> communications air space and entered <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> communications air space In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Cmmdr. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundin </PERSON>, said: `` We have checked with the appropriate authorities and we have no knowledge of any such incident. There are a lot of planes over there and a lot of military planes. If something did happen it may well not have involved our planes.'' He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials would probably investigate the Libyan claim further. The week before, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jets shot down two Libyan military planes over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities said the attack was in self-defense, but <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> claimed the American aircraft launched a `` premeditated'' attack. The Libyan news agency, monitored in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said the captain of the Libyan airliner observed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighter plane flying fast from right to left and then go behind the airliner. Shortly thereafter, the statement said, two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighters appeared, one from the right and the second from the left, each about 10 miles from the airliner and at about the same altitude. They flew alongside the airliner for about 14 minutes, the statement said. It added that the captain informed <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> air control. According to <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> also sent a protest to the Arab civil aviation and the international civil aviation organizations condemning the behavior of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighters, which it said `` endangered the safety of the airliner.'' It said any repetition `` will be considered a threat against international air navigation over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>.''

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was quoted today as saying he may unveil a peace plan during a visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> but will `` swim against the tide'' in opposing a role for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The English-language daily <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as saying in an interview that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to start a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> gave new impetus to the 13-month-long Palestinian uprising, or intefadeh, in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` I must say that their recent step with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> caused grave damage to peace, grave damage to us. I think they prolonged the intefadeh,'' he was quoted as saying, adding that he believed the Palestinians had been on the verge of giving up. He said he was developing specific peace proposals that included his view of a final settlement for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> but refused to disclose his ideas, saying publicity would invite <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> rejection. `` I'm thinking in complete frameworks, but I do not think that it is worthwhile today to make any plan public because this will kill it off ... they will say ` no' and that's it,'' he was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he would make his ideas clear when he visits <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Aides said he is expected to travel to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in late February or March to meet with President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` It could be that I will propose certain ideas, or even more than that, when I go to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was quoted as saying. In a sign of flexibility on procedural questions, the hard-line prime minister said he would welcome help in arranging the talks from <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. But he was adamant in opposing <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> involvement in negotiations because he believed the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> is hostile to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` I will never trust any decision made by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> or by any <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> institution, because we know in advance that any <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> body, no matter what its composition, is against us,'' he was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was sharply critical of European countries for insisting that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> speak with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which he considers to be a terrorist organization bent on destroying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, despite recent <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> statements of moderation. He said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would resist pressure from West European countries. `` This is perhaps our historical destiny, to swim against the tide. But we keep on swimming. We have not drowned yet,'' he was quoted as saying.

<HEAD>11-Year-Old Artist, Missing Three Weeks, Turns Self In</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A troubled 11-year-old came in from the cold after three weeks as a runaway, having captured the city's imagination with drawings and a letter that were published in the newspapers while he was on the streets <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> `` indicated he was tired, tired of living on the streets,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Voelz </PERSON>, his psychiatric social worker, after the boy telephoned him Thursday and asked to be picked up at a suburban shopping center. `` He is a fairly upset young man who needs treatment,'' <PERSON> Voelz </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> bolted from his mother, <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, on Dec. 23 as he was being admitted to a treatment center for children with emotional problems. The boy, `` a very bright young man'' suffering from depression, apparently was afraid of being ridiculed for being treated there, center, <PERSON> Voelz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s talents as an artist were apparent earlier this week when <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> newspapers published portrait sketches obtained from the boy's family. One of the detailed drawings was of an elderly bearded man in a tweed hat, holding a dog. The other sketch was of a downcast adolescent. Police attempted to locate some of the people shown in the sketches in hopes they could lead to the boy. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> published a long, rambling letter <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> had written the newspaper. In it, he complained about being misunderstood, pleaded for understanding and reminded readers, `` I am just one runaway among thousands of others whose stories go untold.'' <PERSON> Voelz </PERSON> said the boy took a few hundred dollars with him when he ran away. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> still had $ 65 Thursday and was wearing warm clothes, insulated mittens and a wool hat, having `` prepared himself like a good Boy Scout,'' <PERSON> Voelz </PERSON> said. Officials said the boy would be admitted to the psychiatric center for about a week and later will be seen on an outpatient basis.

 The <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> has sued <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, charging that its real estate ads promote discrimination by picturing whites almost exclusively. The Times said in statement that its advertising conforms with anti-discrimination laws and that the complaint appeared to be without merit. The plaintiffs, who also included a housing rights group, said photographs and drawings that accompany real estate ads in the Times `` depict whites almost exclusively as potential residents, thus indicating a preference based on race.'' `` Decades ago homeowners could hang up signs, or run ads that said ` Whites Only.' The fair housing laws were designed to change all that,'' <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement Thursday. `` But now developers run ads that say with pictures what they can no longer say with words.''

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee wants to know why the son of an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> congressman was on the congressional payroll while at the same time running for office in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, son of Rep. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, D-Ill., was on the payroll of Del <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s non-voting representative to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, at the same time he was running for the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, has written <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> demanding an explanation of the younger <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s employment, a congressional source said Thursday A federal investigation into the case began last month after <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> was on <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s payroll although he had submitted a sworn affidavit to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> elections officials stating he had met state requirements by living continuously for two years in the legislative district he sought to represent. That period covered the time he was on <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s payroll. House rules, meanwhile, require that a congressional employee report regularly to work. <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> first said the younger <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> had worked on a District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> statehood bill, but <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> later conceded he rarely worked in <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s office and did little more than stuff envelopes when he was there. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> earned $ 21,398 while on <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s payroll from September 1987 through June 1988. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s letter asked <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> to explain how he had come to hire <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, what duties <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> performed, and whether <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> had regularly reported to work, the congressional source reported. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> also is looking into any connection between <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s employment of the younger <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s employment of <PERSON> Lezli </PERSON> <PERSON> Baskerville </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> aide A month before <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> hired <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Baskerville </PERSON> had been ousted from a job <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> had given her on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Committee officials said she had not shown up for work. After leaving the Public Works panel, Ms. <PERSON> Baskerville </PERSON> returned to <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s payroll, where she was directed to do legislative work on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roundtable </ORGANIZATION>, a private group of black businessmen that <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> chairs, according to a memo provided by <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> to his staff. <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, in a statement released Thursday, said: `` On the advice of counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, while I have nothing to hide, I have nothing to say. `` It should be noted that no one on my staff has been subpoenaed by any law enforcement authorities, nor has anyone on my staff even talked to any law enforcement authorities.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials investigating the matter do not have subpoena powers, according to sources familiar with the probe. In addition, congressional sources and others familiar with the investigation said <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s staff director, refused to meet with <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who attempted to question him. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> refused to comment on the matter when telephoned by a reporter. `` I do n't know nothing about no investigation,'' <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> told reporters at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Midway Airport. `` I have n't done anything to get investigated.'' Accusing the assembled media of just wanting `` to make a story,'' <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> testily pointed to one reporter and said: `` Did you stop being a transvestite?'' Contacted by telephone in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Thursday, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> said he was unaware of the investigation. He refused to comment further. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is out of session, and a telephone call to <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s office seeking comment on Thursday's developments was not returned The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> conducts a `` preliminary investigation'' after an initial determination that the known facts in a case warrant a more detailed examination. Ordinarily, a report resulting from a preliminary investigation is sent to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office for review. A decision then is made whether to present the case to a grand jury. In the <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> case, the preliminary investigation will determine whether Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> will seek the appointment of a special prosecutor, the procedure required when members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are involved.

<TEXT>
 A 15-year-old Palestinian died today of head wounds suffered in a clash with troops, and assailants believed to be Jewish militants smashed a monument to Arab soldiers in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> called the vandals in the capital's <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sector `` idiots'' and expressed concern that their action might lead to retaliation by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> militants and further fuel tensions in the city. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, merchants began a seven-day commercial strike after pro-PLO leaders of the Palestinian uprising called for the move in slogans painted on walls. The strike is to protest the Israeli collection of taxes from Palestinians. Non-payment of taxes is a major tactic of the revolt against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rule. The Israeli newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> said today the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has foiled <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> efforts to block its funding of the uprising by using Israeli-Arab businessmen, international organizations and ultra-Orthodox Jews to transfer money. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaub </PERSON> <PERSON> Salhoub </PERSON>, 15, died early today at <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a day after being shot in the head by troops during clashes in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. The army confirmed the death but said it was checking the circumstances. The death brought to 352 the number of Palestinians killed in the 13-month uprising. Fifteen Israelis have also died in the unrest. The monument to soldiers of the Arab Legion outside the Rockefeller Museum was partially smashed, said police spokesman <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapidot </PERSON>. He said police had no suspects. An anonymous caller told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> the monument was damaged by `` lovers of the land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Jewish people.'' The caller said the attack was carried out to protest the dismantling by troops two days ago of a monument erected by Jewish settlers in honor of an Israeli taxi driver slain in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Settlers have vowed to erect additional monuments to Jews killed in the occupied lands in defiance of an army ban. `` The people who did this are stupid, they are idiots,'' said <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON>. He said the city would offer to repair the monument. Police imposed a curfew in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Silwan </LOCATION> neighborhood after they arrested 14 people, including nine said to be firebomb throwers. It was only the third time a curfew was clamped on a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> neighborhood during the uprising. Curfews are a frequent measure of control and punishment in the occupied lands. In a newspaper interview published today, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of prolonging the uprising by opening a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> last month. `` It gave a great push and great encouragement to people who perhaps had reached a point where they were considering desisting from this way -LRB- the uprising -RRB-,'' he was quoted as saying in the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ended a 13-year ban on contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after its chief, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, last month renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. The Maariv newspaper and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> journalists said the closing of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> banks and limits put on money Palestinians can bring into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have not halted <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> funding of the uprising. <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> said a fringe group of ultra-Orthodox Jews, who believe the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> can not exist until the coming of the Messiah, transfer money to <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists, but demand a 25 percent fee for religious seminaries. It said <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> public figures from northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli-Arab </LOCATION> businessmen belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> have pumped millions of dollars into the uprising by laundering money through legitimate businesses. Also today, Palestinian notables considered moderates confirmed they met earlier this week in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> with leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, a pro-Israel lobby in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that has spearheaded the fight to block the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s diplomatic gains The meeting took place at the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> residence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consul <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> and also included <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporters, said one of the participants, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> said such meetings are useful because only staunch supporters of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, such as <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>, could eventually persuade <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders to drop their resistance to talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` The only people who can change <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s views are friends like <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` Criticism from any other source could reinforce <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s paranoia and fears.''

<TEXT>
 A car bomb exploded today in a suburban district of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> controlled by the pro-Iranian militia <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, killing at least six people and injuring 14, police said. The blast came on the sixth day of fierce fighting between <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, and the rival Amal militia for control of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Police said two civilians were killed as the militias battled with mortars and machine guns, and another three were wounded. The afternoon blast in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El-Abed </ORGANIZATION> neighborhood came a half hour after thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> supporters demonstrated against the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, a police spokesman said. He said the demonstrators, who included hundreds of women clad in black chadors from head to toe, had disappeared from the streets when the car bomb went off. The protesters chanted `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the great satan'' and `` Death to -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'' as they marched through the streets following noon prayers. `` If it happened during the demonstration, it would have been a much greater disaster with plenty more casualties,'' said the spokesman, who can not be named under standing rules. He said the bomb-laden car was a dark blue <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, rigged with 220 pounds of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>. The explosion touched off several fires in <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Abed </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Roweiss </LOCATION> neighborhood and many shops and cars parked nearby were gutted, police said. Reporters saw at least 10 cars that had been reduced to piles of twisted metal. Twenty-six others also were damaged on both sides of the street where the explosion occured. Police said the wounded included a driver for a Western news agency and a photographer from a local <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper. Both are Lebanese. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the car bombing, the first in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. By police count there were 20 car bomb explosions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last year that killed 116 people and wounded 488. Another police spokesman said the Amal gunners slammed 120mm rounds at the rate of 10 per minute into the village of <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION>, held by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters. <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION> is 30 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The new casualties in the south raised the toll to 114 killed and 230 wounded since the clashes broke out Sunday on the western edge of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone. The police spokesman said thuds from exploding shells and staccato bursts of machine gun fire echoed across the valleys of <LOCATION> Iklim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tiffa </LOCATION>. The spokesman said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s firepower was `` much weaker than that of <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s ... Hezbollahis responded by shelling <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> positions.'' `` It appears that Amal has started a war of attrition to force the isolated Hezbollahis to consume their stocks of ammunition before trying to storm their positions again,'' the spokesman added. Most of <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION>'s 6,000 residents fled the village after <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> gunmen captured it Sunday along with nearby hamlets. In a counterattack Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> recaptured four villages west of <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION>, 10 miles southeast of the port of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, but have failed to dislodge <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters from the mountain stronghold. <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION> is the key to a 9-square-mile enclave controlled by around 500 <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters. On Thursday, <PERSON> Hezbollahis </PERSON> repulsed a 1,000-strong Amal force, the police spokesman said. Amal, or hope, has cut off supply lines to the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> enclave by blocking its northern, western and southern approaches. Hostile Israeli-backed militiamen of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> man positions to the east. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s Shiite zealots aim at creating an Islamic republic in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> along the lines of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s state in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The more secular <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> favors a government that would give <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Moslems and Christians equal shares in running the nation.

 An engine apparently fell off a cargo plane before it crashed, killing both crewmen, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said today. The twin-engine turboprop bound for <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> went down after takeoff Thursday morning a half mile from <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` They found one of the engines away from the impact site,'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He said that suggests the engine broke loose before impact. Airport spokeswoman <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Caudill </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators recovered the `` black box'' flight recorder and also obtained recordings of conversations between the crew and the control tower. She did not say what they contained. The plane was owned by <ORGANIZATION> Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> and was flying cargo for <ORGANIZATION> Emery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

The plane tore into woods several hundred yards from a row of houses. `` We thought we were dead,'' said <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> <PERSON> Meade </PERSON>, who stood at his window as the plane cleared his roof by a few feet and crashed no more than 200 yards away. `` That's how close it was. We've got debris all over the roof and everything,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A businessman who said his good looks and sexual magnetism made him irresistible to women has been convicted of five sexual assaults, including three rapes. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Panichas </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Fountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> could receive up to 89 years in prison at sentencing March 3. He was found guilty on 19 felony counts for attacks on five women from 1985 to 1988. Panichas, who at one point in his testimony needed several minutes and a pen and paper to calculate his dozens of romantic conquests, insisted all five women consented and enjoyed his advances. In some cases, he said, the women took off their clothes or ripped out portions of their panty hose to entice him. `` I do n't see how this is incredible,'' he testified. `` I guess I'm a good-looking man in their eyes.'' The women, all in their early 20s with long blond hair, testified that after meeting <PERSON> Panichas </PERSON> at a nightclub or during a job interview at his cellular phone business, he wined and dined them and boasted of running a firm that would gross $ 190 million. They said that the 6-foot-5 <PERSON> Panichas </PERSON> then attacked them in his office or in the front seat of his <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION>. One woman said that when she closed her eyes during an attack, <PERSON> Panichas </PERSON> forced them open with his fingers. Investigators said that <PERSON> Panichas </PERSON>' company actually was in serious financial trouble and that he had sold only a handful of phones. The jury deliberated about six hours. `` He was pretty grandiose about his claims of being so sexually active,'' said jury foreman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buskirk </PERSON>. `` It was pretty easy to see through him.''

 <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> today flew the body of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pilot killed in the 1986 raid on <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, where a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> representative turned over the flag-draped coffin to Italian officials. The body was to be handed over later to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. The Libyan military plane, a white Soviet-built Ilyushin with a tiny green Libyan flag near one window, arrived at <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ciampino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> at 3:45 p.m. The Libyan news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was returning the body, but did not identify the pilot. However, <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> reported on Dec. 24 that <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> was offering to return the body of Capt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorence </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s gesture comes during increasing international debate over a suspected poison gas factory in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, and only nine days after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes shot down two Libyan jets over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> also has complained that a <ORGANIZATION> Libyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane en route from <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> on Tuesday was buzzed over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighter planes. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said it had no knowledge of such an incident. At the airport, a delegation including two <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials and several Italian diplomats and air force officers met the plane. No <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were present. The white coffin, draped with an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag and topped with wreaths of red and orange flowers, was carried off the rear section of the plane by the Italian air force officers in blue uniforms and Libyans in green fatigues. The casket was set on the ground briefly before the air force officers tranferred it to a blue police mortuary van. The body was to be taken to a morgue for identification. One of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials, Monsignor <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Mointerisi </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> officials would later turn over the body to the Americans. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said it was acting as an intermediary for `` humanitarian reasons.'' <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> sources said the Libyans first approached the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> around Dec. 15. <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that: `` In the framework of the humanitarian initiatives to which the Great Fatah September Revolution -LRB- <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> government -RRB- devotes a fundamental interest, the body of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> pilot will be handed tomorrow, 13th January, to the representative of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, representing His Holiness, the pope.'' <PERSON> Lorence </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribas-Dominicci </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Utuado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, were in an F-111 that disappeared during the April 15, 1986, raids on <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION>. Witnesses reported seeing an F-111 crash into the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> soon after the plane being hit during the raid. The other 17 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bombers returned safely to their bases after dropping about 100 tons of bombs on the cities. Three months after the 1986 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack, Libyan television showed pictures of a body it said was <PERSON> Lorence </PERSON>'s. Libyan authorities have made no mention of <PERSON> Ribas-Dominicci </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the attack was in retaliation for what he called <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s support for international terrorism. Libyan authorities said the raids killed about 40 people. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> was quoted as saying in the Dec. 24 dispatch that he was returning the body `` especially since this occasion coincides with the end of the rule of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration.'' The move follows the Jan. 4 downing by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jets of two Libyan planes over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities said the attack was in self-defense, but <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> claimed the American craft launched a `` premeditated'' attack. The Libyan gesture also comes after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> threatened possible military action against a nearly completed plant in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, 40 miles from <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, that it says is intended for chemical weapons production.

 A Korean-American businessman arrested in an alleged conspiracy to purchase nerve-gas bombs had contacts in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and possibly <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but officials say it's still unclear who wanted the weapons. <PERSON> Juwhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>, 48, was arrested Thursday and was being held without bail at the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> pending a bond hearing Tuesday. A federal complaint accused <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> of conspiring to violate the Arms Export Control Act by seeking to ship bombs containing sarin, a gas that causes convulsions and death by attacking the central nervous system. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> negotiated with an undercover <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent posing as an arms dealer to purchase 500 quarter-ton bombs and other weapons, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON>, chief agent at the federal agency's <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> office He described the gas as a `` very rapid, odorless, colorless poison which can enter the body by inhalation, absorption or injection.'' No weapons were ever delivered, officials said. `` I ca n't say that there was any indication there was ever any plan to use it or in fact there was actually an end purchaser who had plans to deploy it in any fashion,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chertoff </PERSON>, first assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. At one point in the dealings, the purported destination for the bombs was <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but that has not been verified, <PERSON> Chertoff </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> also contacted the undercover agent about the possible purchase of <LOCATION> TOW </LOCATION> anti-armor weapons and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, apparently for delivery to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the complaint said. A Briton, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, also was charged in the case, which <PERSON> Chertoff </PERSON> called a `` wide-ranging, trans-Atlantic conspiracy.'' Concern over the potential spread of chemical weapons has intensified recently. At a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> conference in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Wednesday, more than 140 nations reaffirmed the 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Protocol banning the use of chemical arms. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>'s arrest came the same day the West German government reversed itself and said it suspected German companies helped build a Libyan plant the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes is a chemical weapons factory. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says the plant will produce medicine. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> was arrested when his wife dropped him off at Customs offices in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, where he believed he was to meet the undercover agent, <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON> said. If convicted, <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> faces up to five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. He told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> that his <LOCATION> Short </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home was worth $ 650,000 and that he also owns a $ 400,000 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> condominium. He said he has three children and has been in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for 17 years. The arrest followed a seven-month investigation that also involved the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, and French and British customs officials. According to the complaint, the undercover agent contacted <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> after Customs received a tip from a confidential informant that <ORGANIZATION> Komex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of Summit was seeking to buy ammunition for export to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> was identified as president of <ORGANIZATION> Komex </ORGANIZATION>, an import-export company that had engaged in legitimate arms dealings. On Nov. 27, the complaint said, <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, who operates <ORGANIZATION> Domino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> if he could obtain 200 to 500 sarin bombs, and three days later <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> asked the Customs agent if he could obtain the ordnance, the complaint said. Throughout the negotiations, <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> was communicating with K.Y. <PERSON> Joo </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Kwang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, the complaint said. French officials entered the investigation when <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> discussed the deal via facsimile with <PERSON> Joo </PERSON>, who was staying in a French hotel. In subsequent fascimile messages last month, <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> discussed the purchase of a minimum of 500 sarin bombs for $ 12,000 each. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> and two other people in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> hotel earlier this month, authorities said. The two others were described in the federal complaint as co-conspirators but were not identified. <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> could be extradited, <PERSON> Chertoff </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> recently completed a nine-month prison sentence in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for conspiring to export 50 gun silencers to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in 1985 through a company called Domino Avionics. He was described in court as a former employee of <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a former military consultant. His attorney said he was a small-time businessman and had a very small part of the arms business. A British Customs spokesman who requested anonymity said of the nerve gas case: `` We were approached by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities in connection with this case and we conducted our own inquiries.'' The spokesman added that British authorities `` have been unable to produce any evidence that an offense has been committed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>.'' A man who answered the telephone at <ORGANIZATION> Komex </ORGANIZATION>'s offices declined comment and hung up. Messages were left on a telephone answering machine at <ORGANIZATION> Domino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. Defense Suppliers' offices in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> They were not immediately returned.

 A prosecutor today said he has opened a criminal investigation into the Imhausen-Chemie company, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> claims helped build a chemical weapons plant in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Botz </PERSON>, chief prosecutor in <LOCATION> Offenburg </LOCATION>, said he opened the probe after reading a report on the dispute in this week's Stern magazine. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, a nationwide news magazine known for its investigative reporting, said Imhausen-Chemie was involved in the Libyan plant, along with I.B.I. Engineering of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and the Hamburg-based <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsao </PERSON> medical material company. Imhausen-Chemie has denied any connection to the plant in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, 60 miles outside <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. News reports and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government sources have said Imhausen-Chemie provided much of the technical equipment for the facility, which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said was built to manufacture poison gas. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> said the plant will produce pharmaceuticals. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Frey </PERSON>, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in <LOCATION> Karlsruhe </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Offenburg </LOCATION>, said the possible charge being investigated is `` a violation of the export control law.'' He said he had no other information about the probe. Imhausen-Chemie, I.B.I. and <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsao </PERSON> have been named by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in their accusations that West German companies aided <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in building the plant. Federal officials have audited Imhausen-Chemie and said they could find no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the Lahr-based company. Federal officials also cleared <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsao </PERSON> of suspicions of wrongdoing but said investigators were examining records seized from I.B.I., which is no longer in business. TV and magazine reports have shown bank documents and other records said to establish Libyan financial links with Imhausen-Chemie and I.B.I. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said Thursday authorities uncovered new documents implicating West German companies in deliveries of equipment for the plant. His spokesman, <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON>, today conceded that <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> officials first learned of `` indications'' in October that West German companies were involved with the plant. <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> was asked about reports alleging <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> officials have known for as long as two years that Imhausen-Chemie and other West German companies may have been involved in the project. He said intelligence sources mentioned the possibility of West German involvement in October but contended they had no evidence then or now that can be used for legal action against any West German companies. Today's announcement followed the arrest of a Belgian shipping agent linked to the case and confirmation Thursday by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador that West German companies assisted in the project. The ambassador, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Treiki </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` did help us, not only in this plant, in other plants also.'' Federal officials said this week that Belgian authorities had arrested and charged <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Gedopt </PERSON>, director-general of <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Link </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION>, with forging shipping documents for goods delivered to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network said <PERSON> Gedopt </PERSON>'s company allegedly used a Cyprus-registered freighter to deliver West German equipment to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in February 1986 after forging destination papers. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that Libyan officials contacted West German companies for clean-up help after a dangerous chemical spill in August at the facility. Both <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified officials as saying the evidence included extensive interceptions of telephone conversations between the Libyans and their suppliers.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> treasury secretary under President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, has been disbarred for tax evasion and illegal banking activities. A state appeals court Thursday called its action `` a sad but we think necessary end to the legal career of one who has in times less beclouded by poor and corrupt judgment served his country in high office.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 78, pleaded guilty in 1987 to evading taxes on $ 240,000 in income for 1983 and 1984 and operating an illegal bank in which investors lost $ 4.4 million.

<HEAD>No Direct Dialogue In French Middle East Peace Initiative</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Israelis and Palestinians met face-to-face today in the French <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, a direct confrontation billed as a peace initiative that never managed to develop into a dialogue. Israelis sat in one row. Palestinians sat in another. Israelis talked. Palestinians talked. But they did n't talk to each other. With television cameras filming their every move, the delegates listened politely to a string of speeches on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s role in making peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The two-day conference, which opened Thursday, was the idea of several members of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and was organized by four French intellectuals. It brought together leftist members of the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and other Palestinians. The <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation was led by <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Souss </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> general delegation in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Nabir </PERSON> <PERSON> Sha'ath </PERSON>, longtime advisor to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. Israeli delegates were <PERSON> Yair </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsaban </PERSON>, head of the socialist <ORGANIZATION> Mapam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lova </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliav </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ora </PERSON> <PERSON> Namir </PERSON> of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Shulamit </PERSON> <PERSON> Aloni </PERSON>, head of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. In a speech, <PERSON> Eliav </PERSON> called compromise `` the essence of peace,'' and he urged direct dialogue with `` the opposite party'' _ the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fayez </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahme </PERSON>, a prominent <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> lawyer in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, said the 13-month-old Palestinian uprising would `` stop tomorrow if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> agreed to an international conference to formulate a peace treaty based on mutual recognition and self-determination.'' `` After 40 years of saying no to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, we finally said yes to co-existence with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We are for a state that recognizes and cooperates with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Now, it's up to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to say yes.'' The Israeli government, now led by right-wing Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, has rejected the idea of a conference. <PERSON> Yael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamir </PERSON>, representing the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Now </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, called for one day of non-violence in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to promote peace. She also urged <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegates to clarify the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s positions, including <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s renunciation of terror last month `` You must say these things again and again, and the Israelis will finally hear,'' she said. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last month which led the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to reverse a 13-year ban on talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Susskind </PERSON>, president of the Belgian <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and moderator of the debate, called for the two peoples to work in harmony. `` The idea of being pro-Palestinian or pro-Israeli has become a thing of the past,'' he said. `` Being for peace means being for both peoples.''

<HEAD>Investigators Report Wiring OK in Engines in Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Investigators have determined that the engines of a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 that crashed Sunday north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> were correctly wired, a newspaper said. The report, if true, would rule out a possible cause of the disaster. Meanwhile, the plane's engines were crated for shipment today to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where the manufacturer will search for clues to the cause of the crash. The British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet, flying from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, crashed into a roadside embankment while attempting an emergency landing at an airport 100 miles north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The disaster killed 44 people and injured 82. Investigators are now trying to solve a major mystery in the crash: why the plane's right engine shut down when the left engine was on fire. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> authorities earlier this week ordered checks on the wiring of similar aircraft engines. That move prompted speculation that a faulty alarm system may have misled the British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> crew into shutting down the wrong engine, causing the crash. The pilot had reported his right engine on fire, but evidence of a fire was found afterward only in the left engine. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said investigators were `` as certain as can be'' that the engines were correctly wired after checks on similar engines ended Thursday. Investigators are still no nearer to discovering the cause of the engine problems and do not know if the cockpit misinterpreted instruments in the control panel, the paper said. The CFM56 engines, jointly made by <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> SNECMA </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, will be stripped down at <ORGANIZATION> SNECMA </ORGANIZATION>'s plant south of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said.

<UNK>Military Says Monitoring Posts Are Angoloan Problem</UNK>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The military today denied a claim that it was aiding Angolan rebels in violation of a peace treaty and said <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> should negotiate with the guerrillas to bring peace to the region. Maj. <PERSON> Valeriano </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinho </PERSON>, an Angolan member of a commission monitoring the cease-fire between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, told journalists visiting the area Thursday that monitoring posts had not been established in southeastern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. He also said he believed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was continuing to supply the rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, through gaps in the border between <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and the South African-ruled territory of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The rebels control the territory and their leader, <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, said several months ago that he would attack any troops trying to enter the area. Under a treaty signed Dec. 22, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has agreed to withdraw from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and allow it to become an independent nation, and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has agreed to pull its troops out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> also agreed to establish monitoring posts along the border. The negotiations did not include the Angolan rebels, who have received aid from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in their 13-year war with the Marxist Angolan government, which has been supported by Cuban troops. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> responded to <PERSON> Martinho </PERSON> with a statement that said the military had done `` everything and more that is required of it in terms of all the agreements signed between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' The statement said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was prepared to establish the monitoring posts on its side of the border `` but is aware of the fact that the Angolan armed forces are experiencing difficulties'' with the guerrillas. `` The best possible solution to the problem'' would be for Angolo to negotiate with the rebels, the statement said. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> says his guerrillas are fighting for a government of national unity to be followed by free elections. The Angolan government has refused to negotiate with him.

<HEAD>Tass Says It Can't Confirm Earthquake Survivor Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> today expressed serious doubts over a story it ran about six men allegedly pulled from the rubble in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> 35 days after the Armenian earthquake. `` Regrettably, we are unable so far to confirm with full certainty the authenticity of the reports made by our Armenian colleagues about the ` <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> miracle,' nor can we categorically deny them,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Today's urgent dispatch was headlined: `` One Always Wants Miracles.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that the six men had been rescued a day earlier from the basement of a wrecked nine-story apartment building after being trapped for five weeks after the Dec. 7 earthquake. The chief source of information for the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> account was <PERSON> Aikaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON>, a 50-year-old electrician. <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> was quoted as saying he and the other men survived because the basement was used to store canned vegetables, smoked ham, stewed fruit and pickles. Soviet television broadcast an interview Thursday night with <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> from his hospital bed, and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda and other Soviet newspapers printed his account of the ordeal and rescue. The story was widely reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said disturbing questions surfaced when Armenian reporters began to check into <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON>'s story. `` Why, for instance, a day after the miraculous salvation, was it possible to locate only <PERSON> Aikaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> in a <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> hospital?'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> asked in the dispatch 24 hours after publication of the first report. `` Where is the survivor's sister, who failed to appear at the hospital on Friday, though she promised to do so?'' <PERSON> Artem </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakhbazyan </PERSON>, a journalist with the state-owned Armenian news agency <ORGANIZATION> Armenpress </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview that agency reporters searched hospitals in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> and the earthquake zone for the other five survivors today failed to located them. Military authorities brought into <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> for the relief effort also knew nothing of the rescue related by <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON>, he said. `` There are doubts about all of this,'' <PERSON> Shakhbazyan </PERSON> said. However, he said <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> was known to be a <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> resident, and that four neighbors who visited him at <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>'s Hospital No. 3 verified that his home had been destroyed by the quake and his wife and children killed. `` He maintains that what he said happened, just as he said it, that he was trapped for 35 days with five other people,'' the Armenpress reporter said. He said <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> was given a psychiatric examination today and found to be sane. <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> was suffering from pneumonia and was in a weakened condition, <PERSON> Shakhbazyan </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said that when <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON>'s account was sent to its <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> headquarters by <ORGANIZATION> Armenpress </ORGANIZATION>, `` it was immediately circulated around the world on the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> wire, picked up by radio and television, with more details added by correspondents of several Soviet newspapers.'' `` Everyone wanted to believe in the <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> miracle,'' it said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> recalled a previous report that 17 earthquake victims had survived for weeks in a wrecked bakery by eating grain and melted snow. That report was denied by rescue officials. `` A host of other news items from <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, truthful and invented, sell on the world news market.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It is understandable: One wants so much to believe in the miracle of six people being saved on the 35th day after the quake.''

 A pair of idiosyncratic talents captured the bulk of Grammy Award nominations, with the feel-good sound of <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> McFerrin </PERSON>'s `` Do n't Worry, Be Happy'' contrasting with the bleak poetry of <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s `` Fast Car.''

In addition, <PERSON> McFerrin </PERSON>, who records his works using only his voice, was nominated for best male jazz vocal performance for the song `` Brothers.''

<HEAD>Parliament Accepts Resignations Of Leadership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Montenegrin Parliament today accepted the resignations of the republic's six-man presidency. The leaders quit following protests over the region's failing economy. <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>'s representative in the federal presidency also stepped down. The resignations marked the first time the entire state and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaderships of one of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics had stepped down. The ouster of the ruling elite came after more than 120,000 people demonstrated in <LOCATION> Titograd </LOCATION>, the region's capital, earlier this week and demanded new leadership because of the disastrous state of the economy. <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>'s government resigned after mass protests in October. `` The current mass dissatisfaction among the workers, students and young people is due to a large extent to the difficulties faced by the country as a whole,'' said parliament's vice president, <PERSON> Bozidar </PERSON> <PERSON> Tadic </PERSON>, in a speech broadcast live on national television. The central committee of <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday accepted the resignation of its ruling Presidium and named interim leadership to prepare for an extraordinary party congress. The parliament, which decided that the republic's presidency will act as a caretaker until new elections are held, also accepted the resignation of its speaker, <PERSON> Velisav </PERSON> <PERSON> Vuksanovic </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s smallest republic and one of its poorest, has been particularly hard hit by the country's economic problems and a decline in living standards. The nation faces a $ 21 billion foreign debt and in 1988 alone inflation ran at 250 percent. The average monthly salary in <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION> is the equivalent of about $ 80. Unemployment in the region soared after closure of a number of unprofitable enterprises previously subsidized by the federal government.

 Backers of a planned memorial honoring blacks who served in the Revolutionary War banked their first major corporate contribution Friday and said they hoped to build it in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by 1991. Design and construction of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriots </ORGANIZATION>' Memorial is expected to cost about $ 4 million, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Noack </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, which contributed $ 25,000 to the project <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> also plans to sponsor a dinner in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on May 23 aimed at raising another $ 250,000, <PERSON> Noack </PERSON> said.

 Air traffic controllers reached tentative agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on their first union contract since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> fired 11,400 controllers in 1981. `` It's a clear victory for both the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and the union,'' said union president <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, who predicted easy approval of the agreement by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controllers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s 7,000 members They make up just over half of the nationwide controller workforce. `` It represents a new spirit of cooperation between labor and management at <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, in sharp contrast to past problems,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON>. The tentative contract was signed late Thursday after a third round of talks in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, Md. The negotiatons began in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in November. The union won the right to represent the 13,000 controllers in June 1987. The former union, the <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controllers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, was forced into bankruptcy and decertified after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s mass firings of most of its members during the strike. The contract does not cover salaries, which are set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, or any matter that would significantly increase cost of the operation. It covers some working conditions, guaranteeing employees breaks and changes in working positions after every two hours. The controllers monitor and control air traffic at about 400 installations around the country. The contract also sets up several committees on safety, technology and other matters, a development that union negotiator <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tamiami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said would give the union more involvement in <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> decision-making. Among provisions are participation of the union in accident investigations that involve a controller's actions, immunity for controllers who report deficiencies in the system, local and national committees on keeping a safe workplace, and evaluation of possibly setting up a program to deal with job stress. Controllers earn between $ 19,000 and $ 55,000 a year, depending on experience and the number of operations conducted at their assigned facilities.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may be the Big Elephant in the inaugural parade next week, but his buddies on a World War II submarine remember him as `` <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON> the Elephant,'' the fun-loving young <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot they rescued from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> 44 years ago. Surviving crew members of the USS Finback are looking forward to a nostalgic reunion with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> here next Wednesday, two days before they watch him take the presidential oath of office on the West Front steps of the Capitol. Inaugural planners have passed the word to several Finback veterans that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is setting aside time to meet with them at <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, across the street from the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, to swap war stories and renew old acquaintances. Prime bleacher seats have been reserved for the inaugural parade Friday down <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> for nearly 30 survivors of the Finback crew, plus several of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s old fellow pilots, who are expected to attend the inauguration. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was nicknamed `` Ellie'' by the Finback's officers for his wardroom imitation of a trumpeting elephant. `` It was n't because we all sat around thinking we were Republicans,'' said retired Rear Adm. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyworth </PERSON>, 67, of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who was the Finback's torpedo and gunnery officer. `` We must have seen one in a Tarzan movie. We just thought elepants were funny. We kept asking <PERSON> George </PERSON> to do it over and over again.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was plucked from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> on Sept. 2, 1944, shortly after he bailed out of his flaming Grumman Avenger torpedo bomber over the <LOCATION> Bonin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> 600 miles south of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism during the bombing raid against an enemy radio communications center. The citation noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, then only 20, completed his dive and hit his target even after his plane was hit and engulfed in smoke. His two crew members were lost. `` At that time, he was just another downed pilot,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohler </PERSON>, 64, of <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, the torpedoman who helped pull <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> out of his bobbing orange life raft to the safety of the Finback's deck. `` Nobody back then knew he'd become president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' During the month he spent on the Finback before saying goodbye at <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> eagerly took his turn at night lookout watches and other seagoing duties, watched <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Grable </PERSON> movies in the wardroom and donned earphones to listen in awe as the submarine's torpedoes sank two enemy ships Retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. W.E. `` Bill'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, who filmed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s rescue with a <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> movie camera from the Finback's conning tower, remembers <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s surprise that his first meal on the submarine that night was filet mignon and fresh strawberry shortcake with whipped cream `` He said he'd been eating nothing but Spam and beans on the carriers,'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, 67, said in a telephone interview from his retirement home at <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, Miss. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was one of three <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilots rescued by the Finback during <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carrier raids against the <LOCATION> Bonin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in early September. `` I remember he was very lively, obviously intelligent and very personable,'' said <PERSON> Heyworth </PERSON>. `` All three pilots we rescued were bright, bright-eyed young men, but <PERSON> George </PERSON> seemed the most outgoing and had the most ebullient personality. He was the most entertaining, and he made us laugh a lot.''

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived this morning for a pre-inaugural weekend of fishing to `` clear the mind'' for the task ahead. `` I doubt I'll get another chance to come here as president,'' he said in this self-proclaimed sportfishing capital. `` There wo n't be any winter or summer White House anywhere. I have no intention of building something else.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived at Marathon Airport aboard Air Force Two. He was dressed casually in a blue blazer, gray slacks and boat shoes. `` Why go fishing?'' asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose inauguration is Jan. 20. `` Contentment, environment, total relaxation, peace of mind, clear the mind for the decisions ahead.'' He said he was looking forward to `` splendid isolation'' on his visit to the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was greeted by pigtailed 6-year-old <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFoor </PERSON>, daughter of the local sheriff. Wearing a flowered dress and black patent leather shoes, she said she was `` very excited'' about the president-elect's arrival. The vice president and a crew of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> fishing buddies planned to drive 32 miles north, check into a townhouse, then head for the shallows of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Fishing guide <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hommell </PERSON>, who has taken <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> out before, said he had his 17-foot skiff ready for excursions into Everglades National Park waters and the home of `` bonefish, which is probably the fastest fish in the world.''

 A couple accused of enslaving two mentally retarded men for more than a decade on their dairy farm have been fined and ordered to pay the men $ 34,000 in restitution. <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margarethe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozminski </PERSON> of <PERSON> Chelsea </PERSON> pleaded guilty in October to a reduced charge of violating the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to maintain necessary employment records for the men. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Plata </PERSON> on Wednesday fined the Kozminskis $ 3,000 each and ordered them to pay restitution to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulmer </PERSON>, 72, and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Molitoris </PERSON>, 65.

<HEAD>Source: Party Ready to Offer Legalization to Solidarity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders are ready to make Solidarity legal again if the trade union will help back their political and economic reforms, a government source said Friday. The source _ a party member informed about preparations for a key meeting of the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Monday and Tuesday _ characterized the decision as `` a gamble'' and `` revolutionary'' for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. If it is accepted by the opposition, it will mark the end of an era of political impasse in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and represent an admission that authorities' efforts through most of the 1980s to destroy the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's only independent union movement have failed. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was not available for comment Friday evening. Union national spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said he had not been expecting such a dramatic action from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting, `` but if it happened, it would be very good'' and could `` open the road'' to talks between the opposition and the government. Members of the ruling Politburo, led by Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, visited factories Friday to inform party units about the plenum, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news service reported. The source, who demanded anonymity, said Solidarity could be legalized in a few months if it agrees to certain conditions, which he said might be expected to include a promise to obey a 1982 union law that spells out arbitration procedures in collective bargaining disputes and bans wildcat strikes. Solidarity, banned seven years ago, has said it would accept legalization within the framework of that law. Solidarity would also be expected to begin talks immediately with the authorities, the source said. It would be asked to agree with authorities on the form and aims of a new election law that could result in a `` substantial presence'' of the opposition in parliament _ but leave the party in a coalition majority with the allied Peasant and Democratic parties, the source said. The arrangement would mean the communists would have diminished power in the parliament, because they now have an absolute majority and do not need the coalition parties to rule, the source said. Parliamentary elections are scheduled this year and <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> has stressed that more opposition voices should be heard in parliament. However, the party wants to allocate seats to various constituencies rather than have Western-style competition among opposing parties, as the opposition prefers. Other topics for discussion would be on the formation of a second chamber of parliament and on a permanent <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconciliation </ORGANIZATION>, a committee that would represent a broad political spectrum of views and seek consensus on major issues. Compromise with the opposition is possible in part because of the changing international situation, including the reforms being carried out by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the easing of U.S.-Soviet tensions, the source said. Authorities expect the West to support Polish reforms and encourage the opposition `` in a positive sense,'' but not to back `` adventures, revolt and civil war,'' he said, arguing that only peaceful change, not confrontation, will bring results. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> also expects the decision to recognize Solidarity to lead Western governments to look more favorably on the country's requests for credits in such forums as the <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the source said. The country already has hints that Western governments will look on the action favorably, he said. `` We hope that this decision will facilitate financial relations with the West and Western participation in the Polish reform,'' said the source. `` We count on the opposition being loyal, so we can have this year a legal opposition in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' the source said. He said the compromise as he described it was `` possible but not 100 percent sure. There are people against agreement.'' There are party members who oppose the compromise, especially within the official trade union movement OPZZ, but <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> favor the agreement and have sufficient backing to produce a declaration at the party meeting, the source said. The source estimated that no more than one-third of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members will be opposed or hesitate before approving the decision. The source said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> must decide if he prefers `` legalization and some divisions'' in his ranks `` or unity and continuation of the situation. `` According to our knowledge, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and those around him are for the agreement,'' he said. Solidarity was suspended and then banned after a Dec. 13, 1981, military crackdown when authorities said the union had been taken over by radicals intent on toppling <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist system. The union had a 16-month legal existence after August 1980, and continued to be active after the imposition of martial law, first as an underground organization and more openly since a 1986 political amnesty.

 Contradictory bookkeeping procedures and a desire to boost commissions within the treasurer's office contributed to losses of $ 279 million in the state's investment fund, Gov. Arch <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who leaves office Monday, announced the findings of a private audit of the fund Thursday. It was the Republican's first public comment on the investment fund loss since it became public after the Nov. 8 election, in which <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was defeated by Democrat <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>. State officials have n't said yet which state agencies and local governments will absorn the losses, so the effect of the missing money is not clear, said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, a Democrat. Even without taking into account the missing $ 279 million, the state has been experiencing financial problems so severe that income tax refunds were delayed up to five months in 1988. House of Delegates Speaker <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, a Democrat, said after the governor's announcement that it appeared the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> was n't paying attention when the investment fund was losing money. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> chairs the board, whose other members are Treasurer <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> and Auditor <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gainer </PERSON>. The board has nominal control of the investment fund. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said at a news conference that <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>'s office was making inflated and unrealistic interest payments to local governments, even when the losses were piling up, so the treasury could attract commissions. The consolidated fund's losses totaled $ 279 million through Nov. 30, said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. The audit by <ORGANIZATION> Touche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` ascertained that the treasurer's office kept two sets of books,'' said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` They kept one set of books to determine what they paid out in interest. Another set -LRB- was kept -RRB- as related to their transactions and they never reconciled the two methods.'' For example, the central investment pool in the consolidated investment fund paid out rates of 9 percent, 8.3 percent, and 7.8 percent respectively in April, May and June 1987, when the losses were severest and the fund had no earnings, the audit showed. `` You will find that the treasurer's office was paying out tremendously large sums of money that they were not earning,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, however, was unhappy with the reference to `` two sets of books.'' `` I would like to believe that it was one accounting system which took care of profits and the losses. There was another accounting system which took care of the distributions. The distributions never have shown where the losses were,'' the treasurer said. Under the guidelines of the fund, created in 1978, the treasurer could go to an outside agency to handle investments or he could charge a commission on what investments he could gather from local governnments. The commissions `` were not monitored by the Legislature. They were a fund out of which the treasurer's office could do essentially what he wanted to do,'' said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. The fund generated from commissions was used to pay for day-to-day expenses in the treasurer's office. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the investment office borrowed billions of dollars' worth of funds from brokerage houses to help buy the huge amounts of securities transactions that were being handled by the investment office The $ 1.7 billion fund saw sales of $ 80.5 billion in 1987. The audit showed that $ 27.2 billion was borrowed in 1986 and 1987, including $ 10.8 billion in April 1987, the month in which the largest loss was recorded. An addition, $ 4.3 billion was borrowed in 1988. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said much of the borrowing occurred without the knowledge of the Board of Investments.

<HEAD>Internal Argument Surfaces In U.S. Agency Over African National Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A disagreement surfaced Friday within the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> about whether the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is a terrorist organization or a legitimate freedom-fighter. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s internal argument arose following inclusion of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> in a book, `` Terrorist Group Profiles,'' issued this week by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Officially, spokesmen for both departments said they agreed the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> should be in the book. `` That was an information document,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>. `` It's not meant to be a policy publication,'' he added. But within the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, counterterrorism officials disagreed with professional diplomats concerned with maintaining ties to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s black majority. The section on the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, one of some 50 groups in the compilation, says that the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s indiscriminate attacks on civilians in recent years could endanger Americans caught in the cross fire. A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the group was included in the book because authorities wanted to warn Americans of the danger from the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and other organizations around the world. The spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kudla </PERSON>, said the book had been `` fully coordinated'' with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The office of counterterrorism at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> concurred that the inclusion of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> had been approved, saying that while the group is `` a political guerrilla organization, it also has used terrorist tactics.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> also said that `` there's no question that certain -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- acts ... would be considered terrorist acts.'' But he also read a statement prepared by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> which said `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government has not determined that the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is a terrorist organization.'' The statement added that `` we regard the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> as a politically diverse organization ... with substantial political support in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Some of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s political objectives, such as ending apartheid and establishing a non-racial government in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are goals we share,'' the statement said. `` We strongly differ with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> on some of the methods they have used to pursue these objectives, including the use of violence,'' the statement added. A bureau official, asked by a reporter if the statement was at odds with the position of the counterterrorism office, said `` I ca n't go any further.'' The official declined to be identified by name. A counterterrorism office official, who also declined to be identified by name, indicated that there was a difference between the positions. Despite periodically condemning the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s car bombings and other attacks, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met in Januray 1987 with <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials maintain contacts with the group. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> also has support among liberals in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but conservatives condemn the group as a communist organization armed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Pentagon book says the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is armed with Soviet weapons and gets most of its training in Marxist-oriented <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The South African government in 1960 banned the then-peaceful <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, and one year later the group began a sabotage campaign. In recent years the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s attacks have expanded to include random bombings in busy public places such as fast-food restaurants and bus depots. There have been 180 bombings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> over the past 31 months, killing 35 people and injuring at least 665.

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he would take `` a hard new look'' at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration policies, but he blamed the influx of refugees from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on what he called tyranny in leftist-run <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at a brief news conference at the airport in nearby Marathon en route to a weekend of fishing in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>, defended offshore oil drilling and said it can be done without harming the environment. He also said he would strive throughout his presidency to rid the world of chemical and biological weapons. Referring to the furor over what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> contends is a chemical weapons plant under construction in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I think there is much more understanding now about that <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> -LRB- plant -RRB- and I think that's a good thing.'' `` But I think the way to approach it now is to build on what happened there in terms of worldwide understanding, to start with a determination to stop proliferation'' of chemical weapons, he said. Earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters traveling wioth him from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that he never doubted West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s commitment to eliminating chemical weapons The <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government said Thursday it now has indications that a German company may have links to the suspect plant. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is being joined on the fishing trip by buddies including <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., was asked first what he planned to do about the influx of refugees overburdening the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied that the influx of refugees into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and his home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> `` is causing an overburdening of facilities like schools and hospitals. This is a sorry commentary on what's happening in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and we've been seeing this for a long, long time `` When I become president, we're going to take a hard new look at the immigration policies,'' he said, `` but there is no easy answer to it. `` The final answer is democracy and freedom in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' the vice president added. `` When people are fleeing tyranny the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has to be generous. But no one community can suffer an overload without some support.'' Asked what he would do about the refugees already here, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied crisply, `` The law takes care of that.'' Queried as to whether he favors a ban on oil leasing in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman, said, `` What does that have to do with fishing?'' He went on: `` Look I've pledged two things: One is recognizing that this country can not depend on foreign oil for our national security, but -LRB- needs -RRB- prudent development of our offshore resources. `` Two, I am pledged to see that that is done with total compatability to our marine life and to other environmental considerations. The president-elect said he knows `` it can be done compatibly ... because I have experience in this first hand in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' When a local reporter asked if he would have a winter White House at <LOCATION> Islamorada </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` There will be no winter or summer White Houses anyplace. I have a home now -LRB- in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> -RRB- and that's the one house that I have and I hope to get to there sometime.'' On <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the fact that his new Cabinet is heavily weighted with familiar <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> figures was just what he wanted. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had promised to bring `` new faces'' to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but he said: `` I never pledged that I would have a totally inexperienced Cabinet. There's a lot of new faces in the Cabinet. It depends how you define new _ new from the old -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration -RRB- Cabinet, not new from having no experience in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I want an experienced Cabinet. That's exactly what we've got,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who choose only three people without <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> backgrounds to fill his 17 Cabinet and Cabinet-level jobs. The president-elect, who once hoped to appoint the whole Cabinet before Christmas, finally finished the task Thursday by naming former naval chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> as energy secretary and tapping former Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> to lead anti-drug efforts. Seven current or former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Cabinet officers and two retiring Republican lawmakers will hold top jobs under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He also enlisted <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, an undersecretary of state and former congressman, to head the new <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, and kept <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> on as <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director. Labor Secretary-designate <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative, will be the only women in the Cabinet It will have two Hispanics _ <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> at Education and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> _ and one black, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> assembled his Cabinet at <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for an informal meeting followed by a dinner with their spouses. He told reporters beforehand: `` I'm going to tell them to think big. I'm going to tell them to challenge the system. I'm going to tell them to ... adhere to the highest ethical standards.'' He also said, more in earnest than in jest, `` I'm going to tell them I do n't like kiss-and-tell books.'' He added that he wants them to `` be on the record as much as possible.'' `` I'd rather see their name on the record than insidiously leaked to somebody,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I do n't mind differences being aired. I want them to be frank. I want them to fight hard for their position, and then, after I make the call, I'd like to have the feeling that they'd be able to support the president,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I'll tell them to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. We're going to have some fights with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but we're not going to approach it as though we're dealing with the enemy,'' the president-elect said. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, 61, the chief of naval operations until 1986 under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, is a nuclear warfare expert who headed the presidential commissin on AIDS that called last year for new legislation to protect the civil rights of victims of the deadly disease. The retired admiral said he is determined to make sure that `` safety is never subverted -LRB- and -RRB- the environment is adequately protected'' while nuclear energy is developed. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, 45, a longtime two-pack-a-day smoker, said he would kick the habit before he is sworn in as director of national drug control policy. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who will be sworn in Friday, said he is `` not entirely'' comfortable with the cost of his inauguration, which could reach $ 25 million. However, he said it is being paid for largely with private funds and the country deserves `` every four years something as unifying, with the pageantry and the drama, of an inauguration.'' The excursion to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s third fishing or hunting trip since his election two months ago. He went fishing in <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stream </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, in November and went hunting and fishing in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> the week after Christmas.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Surge In 1988 Despite Weak December Spending</HEAD>

 Retail sales grew in 1988 at their strongest pace in four years, the government reported Friday, but the year went out with a whimper of weak holiday sales at department stores and car dealerships. Sales totaled $ 1.61 trillion for the year, up 6.7 percent from 1987 and the largest annual increase since a 9.8 percent gain in 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. But despite rosy expectations for strong year-end sales by retailers and car dealers, December sales were up just 0.2 percent from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted $ 138 billion. December's gain was the slowest since a 0.3 drop in September that was followed by a revised 1.7 percent increase in October and a 0.9 percent rise in November. The figures are not adjusted to exclude the effects of rising prices. Economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said that while the overall sales figure for 1988 turned out to be `` a lot better than we feared it was going to be after the stock market crash'' in October 1987, December's numbers were unexpectedly low. `` It suggests that we're entering 1989 with a lot less momentum than we thought we had,'' <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said. `` I would n't call it a worry yet, but it does suggest that the economy is going to be slowing down in 1989.'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Levy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecasts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chappaqua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the report shows consumers `` have moved toward caution'' after a period of more buoyant spending. The bond market rallied in early action Friday as traders read the sales figures as a sign of a slowing economy that would place less upward pressure on interest rates. However, some economists were skeptical about the implications of the report, saying December's weak numbers later might be revised upward and that they might not reflect strong sales late in the month, particularly of automobiles. `` All I know is that auto companies were well satisfied with what they saw and the general merchandisers were well satisfied,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said that while retail sales were n't as strong as expected for December, spending still showed modest growth that should continue into the new year. While overall retail sales for the year were posting their best showing since 1984, the department store category rose by just 4.5 percent, the smallest annual gain since a 3.4 percent rise in the recession year of 1982. This sluggish performance was offset by a 9.5 percent rise in auto sales for the year, up sharply from a 1.8 percent increase in 1987. However, auto sales actually fell in December, dropping 0.3 percent from the previous month and posting the first decline since a 1.4 percent drop in September. Excluding autos, retail sales were up 0.3 percent in December, following a 0.6 percent rise in November. Retail spending is seen as a key barometer of economic health because it represents about one-third of the gross national product. The holiday season is particularly important because it can account for half of a general retailer's annual profits. Sales by general merchandisers reached $ 15.76 billion in December, up 0.3 percent from a month earlier. Other categories posting gains during December included furniture stores, service stations and bars and restaurants. Sales decreased at food, clothing and drug stores.

 A `` Friday the 13th'' computer virus struck personal computers in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Friday, wiping out program files and annoying businesses, a computer expert said. Hundreds of personal computer users found the virus was programmed to delete files on Friday the 13th, said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, managing director of S and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, a data recovery center in <LOCATION> Chesham </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Church of Nativity Roof Leak Causes Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A leaky roof on the church built over the grotto where <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> is believed to have been born has revived an ancient dispute among three Christian communities over control of the church. When the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> recently tried to repair the roof on the Church of the Nativity, Roman Catholics and the Armenians complained. Now the Israeli government has taken responsibility for repairs, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> spokesman said Friday. `` The workers who were on the roof had to be ordered off,'' said <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamburger </PERSON>, religious affairs officer for the military government of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, where the church in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> is located. Hamburger said the argument dates to before 1852, when the then-Turkish government of Palestine stepped in to settle disputes among the three churches. An agreement known as `` the status quo'' was established to assign such responsibilities as cleaning the church, but roof repairs have always been disputed. `` The procedure in which the roof is repaired, from the time of the Turks, was done by the government,'' <PERSON> Hamburger </PERSON> said. Construction on the Church of the Nativity began in the 4th century. The Greek Orthodox Church gained title in 1672, but the Roman Catholics obtained partial ownership in 1852. The Armenians control a southern section of the church. The grotto where tradition says <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was born is under the Greek Orthodox part of the church. The three churches jealously guard their rights as outlined in `` the status quo,'' and roof work done in 1983 also caused a dispute. The Rev. <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Baratto </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said his church and the Armenians consider the roof common property and believe any repairs should be approved by all three churches. <PERSON> Baratto </PERSON> said the roof has been leaking for years and referred to it as part `` an ancient question'' over which the churches continue to argue. `` Some parts pretend to have rights that the other parts contest,'' he said. `` We hope in the future to reach a sensible solution,'' Baratto added. But for now, he said, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> government will have to take responsibility for the repairs. Hamburger said they should be made after the rainy winter weather subsides. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON>, secretary to the Greek Orthodox Patriarch, told the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that the church was not trying to repair the roof but only to clean out rain gutters. He added, however, that the church has the right to make roof repairs if it wishes. `` If we wanted to do something, we would do it. I do n't think they had the right to complain,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.

<TEXT>
 A British warplane strayed into a squadron of West German jet fighters Friday and collided with two of them, killing two British fliers and injuring a German pilot, officials said. Opposition political leaders quickly responded with demands for a reduction in the number of military flights over <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where more than 100 people died last year in military-related crashes. A spokesman at the West German <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> said the British Tornado jet flew into a group of eight German Alfajet fighters that were preparing to land at <LOCATION> Wittmund </LOCATION> air base near the northern town of <LOCATION> Wiesmoor </LOCATION>. The spokesman said the Tornado hit two of the Alfajets. One crashed into a Wiesmoor field after the pilot ejected, and the other managed to land safely at the nearby military airbase, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the West German pilot who ejected was hospitalized in good condition. A spokesman at the British forces headquarters in <LOCATION> Rheindahlen </LOCATION> said the two-man British crew died when the Tornado crashed outside <LOCATION> Wiesmoor </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ruediger </PERSON> <PERSON> Schad </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 43rd <ORGANIZATION> Fighter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bomber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION>, said the British and German aircraft were on unrelated training missions. Several houses on the edge of <LOCATION> Wiesmoor </LOCATION> were slightly damaged by debris from the crash, but there were no civilian casualties, according to a police spokesman in the village. <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stock </PERSON>, interior minister of <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saxony </LOCATION> state, where Wiesmoor is located, called for a 50 percent reduction of low-level training flights in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolbow </PERSON>, a defense expert with the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the crash `` is deadly proof of the urgency in finding a new defense readiness concept.'' Another Social Democrat, <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, accused Defense Minister <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> of `` ignoring the concerns'' of West German citizens. <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> has come under fire amid widespread calls for ending <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> low-level training flights over <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders say such flights are essential for maintaining combat readiness. The West German <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> is expected next week to submit a report on ways to reduce military aircraft training flights. On Dec. 8, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> A-10 Thunderbolt slammed into a residential neighborhood in the city of <LOCATION> Remscheid </LOCATION>, killing the pilot and five people on the ground.

<HEAD>Wholesale Prices Rise 4 Percent in 1988, Biggest Increase in 7 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The rate of increase in wholesale prices nearly doubled in 1988 to 4 percent, the worst pace since Americans began recovering from double-digit inflation at the beginning of the decade, the government said Friday. Although inflation is still a far cry from 1979 and 1980, when wholesale prices posted back-to-back increases of 13 percent and 12 percent, many economists said they are worried about the trend. The rise in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index for finished goods, one stop short of the retail level, was the worst since 1981, when it shot up 7.1 percent. The index rose 2.2 percent in 1987. A year before that, it recorded a rare decline, of 2.3 percent. `` I do n't like the sound of a doubling of inflation, but we have to put 4 percent in perspective,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's not that bad, but it's not that good either If we were at 4 percent and moving down, I would n't worry about it. But, we're heading up What concerns me is the potential for further acceleration,'' he said. Meanwhile, in a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said retail sales in December rose a lackluster 0.2 percent, following strong increases in October and November. Economists said that figure, if it is not re-estimated in subsequent months, could be an indication that the momentum of economic growth slowed a bit as 1988 ended. That would ease inflationary pressure and make it less necessary for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to boost interest rates. In response, the bond market rallied in early trading. For the year, retail spending rose 6.7 percent in 1988 to $ 1.61 trillion, the best performance in four years. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration this week, in its final economic report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, listed the taming of inflation as one of its greatest accomplishments. The administration is predicting a steady drop in the rate through 1994. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahn </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and an adviser to President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said the annualized wholesale inflation rate, when looked at by quarter, eased last year: from 4.9 percent in the second quarter, to 4.6 percent in the third to 3.3 percent in the fourth. `` Inflation watchers should not be concerned,'' he said. But, most other private analysts expect tight labor markets and a squeeze on factory capacity to produce at least a modest price speedup, with inflation rates above 5 percent by the end of 1989. The unemployment rate in December matched a 14-year low, while factories were straining in November at the highest operating levels in nine years. `` Inflation -LRB- in 1988 -RRB- worsened and then paused. I think this build-up in pressure will cause it to worsen again,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration economist now with <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Much of the impetus for wholesale price increase last year was provided by a drought-induced 5.7 percent increase in food prices, the steepest since 1980. They had showed no change in 1987. Meanwhile, energy prices, which had soared 11.2 percent in 1987, fell 3.4 percent in 1988. However, with the production agreement reached by the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations in November, analysts expect higher oil prices this year. All other finished goods in 1988 rose 4.3 percent. In December, food prices fell a slight seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent and energy costs edged up only 0.2 percent. Everything else jumped 0.6 percent, the biggest increase since September. This is the third consecutive month of good news for grocery shoppers. Prices were unchanged in November after a 0.1 percent decline in October. However, that period of stability was preceded by seven consecutive months of increases from early spring through the summer. The department reported December declines in these catagories: turkey, 17.1 percent; fresh and dried vegetable prices, 8.5 percent; fresh fruit, 2.7 percent; fish, 1.3 percent, and pork, 0.3 percent. There were gains of 3 percent for beef, 2.5 percent for chicken, and 1 percent for dairy products. Fuel oil in December soared 8.5 percent and natural gas rose 3.3 percent. Gasoline prices, however, fell 3.5 percent, holding back overall energy gains. For other items, a sharp 5.7 percent increase in tobacco prices and significant gains of 0.9 percent in automobile costs and 0.7 percent in women's clothing led the index. The overall December increase left the Producer Price Index for finished goods at 110.0, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $ 100 in 1982 would have cost $ 110 last month, 30 cents more than in November. December's Consumer Price Index, which measures prices at the retail level and, unlike the wholesale index includes services and imports, is scheduled for release on Jan. 19.

<HEAD>Hong Kong Panel Bars Elected Official for 15 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A joint <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong-China </LOCATION> panel approved a measure Friday to bar the enclave from electing its own chief executive for at least 15 years after Chinese rule begins in 1997, a committee member said. However, the committee's political blueprint would also provide for increasing proportions of elected seats in the local legislature. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a pro-democracy lawyer from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> who sits on the committee, said the plan, which must be approved by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, represents `` a big step backward as far as democracy was concerned.'' The proposal is included in a proposed constitution by which <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> will govern capitalist <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> after the British withdraw from the colony on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s coast. The document is designed to enshrine the `` one country-two system'' plan promised by <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to allow this territory of 5.7 million people to exercise a `` high degree of autonomy'' and remain capitalist for at least 50 years after the change in sovereignty. The 58-member committee with <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and Chinese representatives met in the nearby southern <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> on Friday and approved most of the second draft to be submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. A third and final draft is expected to be approved by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> next year. In an interview from <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said the group backed a plan under which the first three post-colonial chief executives, serving five-year terms, would be chosen by an electoral college. A governor appointed by <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> heads the colonial government. The chief executive will be post-colonial <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s top local official. Under the committee's proposal, a referendum could be held to determine whether the fourth chief executive will be popularly elected. However, the vote will take place only if half the members of the local legislature, the sitting chief executive and a committee of the Chinese congress approve, according to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. `` Effectively, we may never have a directly elected chief executive,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. The committee also proposed that the first four post-1997 local legislatures, each lasting four years, be composed of directly elected members and interest group representatives, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. Popularly elected members will constitute 27 percent of the first legislature, 38 percent of the second and 50 percent of the third and fourth. If a referendum is held, the public could decide whether all members are popularly elected, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fees for grazing livestock on public land administered by the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will be boosted by up to 25 percent, effective March 1, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today. <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said monthly fees for grazing stock on nationa forests in 15 Western states will be raised to $ 1.86 per head, up 32 cents from last year. Fees for national grasslands in nine states will be raised 46 cents to $ 2.29 per head. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depatrtment </ORGANIZATION> said it planned similar increases in grazing fees on lands controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. `` Grazing fee rates are going up because the prices farmers and ranchers received for beef cattle increased by 9 percent, and private grazing land lease rates increased in most of the staes involved,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. On the other hand, cost increases for livestock production `` were modest in comparison,'' he said. These are factors included in a formula to determine annual grazing fees. For grazing fee purposes, the term `` head month'' is used, which was described by the agency as `` a month's occupancy and use of range by one weaned or adult cow, bull, steer, heifer, horse, burro or mule; or five sheep or goats.'' The new fees apply to national forests in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>.

 Authorities arrested seven human rights activists, and they face prosecution on charges of telling lies about the state, the government said Friday.

It identified four of them as <PERSON> Ilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoyanov </PERSON> <PERSON> Minev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Grigor </PERSON> <PERSON> Simov </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozhilov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dimiter </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomov </PERSON> <PERSON> Yordanov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Blagoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassilev </PERSON> <PERSON> Topouzliev </PERSON>. An exile source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Minev </PERSON> was president of the human rights group and had spent 27 years in jail. The <ORGANIZATION> Otechestven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> newspaper linked <PERSON> Menev </PERSON> to <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Genov </PERSON>, a leading Bulgarian dissident who spent 10 years in internal exile. He and another activist, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankov </PERSON>, were expelled and arrived in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on Oct. 20. In an interview then, <PERSON> Genov </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that Bulgarian officials appeared poised to stifle dissent out of fear it might snowball into a growing opposition. The <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> announcement said most of those arrested had been previously convicted of various crimes and investigators would `` undertake the necessary actions for clarifying the facts and circumstances -LRB- for -RRB- charging these people with criminal offenses.'' It added, `` In complicity and internationally, they have disseminated untruthful allegations with the aim to create mistrust of authorities and their work.'' The allegation apparently referred to interviews given by some of those arrested to Western reporters or radio stations.

<HEAD>Kimball May Seek Plea Change To Save Insurance Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Olympic diver <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> may be allowed to change his guilty plea in a drunken-driving manslaughter case to safeguard insurance money for victims and their families, his attorney said. The guilty plea <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> entered Wednesday could amount to a breach of contract and allow his insurance company to cancel a $ 1.3 million liability insurance policy, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Quesada </PERSON>, a lawyer for the 1984 silver medalist. So <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> may seek to change his plea to `` no contest'' before sentencing Jan. 30, <PERSON> Quesada </PERSON> said. `` The company could cut <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> loose,'' he said. `` It has nothing to do with the way <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> feels ... A change -LRB- in pleas -RRB- would be all for the victims.'' Hillsborough Circuit Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Coe </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said he would accept a no-contest plea if it's proven his policy would be canceled. <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> pleaded guilty after listening to only a few minutes of testimony about the Aug. 1 crash, which killed two teen-agers and injured four others. He said he wanted to spare the families the grief of hearing descriptions about how his car plowed into the youths on a dead-end road in suburban <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON>, 25, is being held in <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail awaiting sentencing on two counts of drunken-driving manslaughter and three counts of causing great bodily injury while driving under the influence of alcohol. He faces between seven and 22 years in prison under state sentencing guidelines. There are four civil lawsuits pending against <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> stemming from the accident, a month before the 1988 Olympic diving trials in which he participated but failed to make the team. If the victims' lawsuits are successful, money from <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON>'s liability insurance policy could pay for damages <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON>'s attorney in the civil cases, said he did n't know if the insurance company, <ORGANIZATION> AAA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, would cancel <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON>'s policy. <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON>, who was placed alone in a jail cell after defense attorneys claimed he was a suicide risk, has been adapting to life behind bars, jail supervisor Maj. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said Thursday. `` I talked with him today and his mood was up. He seemed calm. His spirits were upbeat compared to yesterday after the shock of coming into a hard-core jail from the outside,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. `` He was not introspective. He told me, ` I ` ve got some adjustments to make and I'm making them,''' he said.

 <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> on Friday denied allegations by <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> students have been forcibly repatriated from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and arrested upon their arrival in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. `` I believe the government has more information than a body which is 1,000 miles away,'' <PERSON> Ohn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyaw </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Burmese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said in response to the charges by the London-based group. <PERSON> Ohn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyaw </PERSON> spoke with reporters invited by the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> military to accompany 32 students on a flight Friday from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. Under an agreement reached in December by the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> army chief and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s leader, Gen <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, 292 Burmese students have been repatriated. The <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> statement said 22 students who returned Jan. 7 were forced to after being rounded up by Thai police. It said Thai army personnel forced them onto the plane even though the students expressed fears for their safety, petitioned to be allowed to stay in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, and went on a hunger strike. According to <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> state radio, two of the students _ <PERSON> Sao </PERSON> <PERSON> Myo </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> _ were taken into military custody for questioning and reports indicated a third, <PERSON> Tu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ain </PERSON> <PERSON> Tin </PERSON>, also was arrested, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said. The group said the three were active in pro-democracy demonstrations in August and September. `` As far as we know, <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> is at home right now,'' <PERSON> Ohn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyaw </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Sao </PERSON> <PERSON> Myo </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> and others also were `` peacefully at home.'' <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it also had reports that another student, Zaw Win Tin, died Dec. 30, after being held in military custody in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. `` He had been arrested several weeks earlier and had apparently been held incommunicado without charge or trial since then,'' <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said. `` He is said to have died from the effect of the severe ill treatment he sustained while in prison.'' Students had led a nationwide pro-democracy campaign until <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> seized power Sept. 18. Thousands of students fled to Thai border areas controlled by anti-government guerrillas, seeking refuge and military training. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> at first promised the students temporary asylum. That changed after the Thai army chief, Gen. <PERSON> Chavalit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongchaiyudh </PERSON>, visited <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> on Dec. 14 and reached the repatriation agreement. At the news conference in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> were students who said they had made several trips to the border to try to persuade fellow students to return. The students said they had returned to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> because they felt `` used'' by the insurgents. Before Friday's flight left Tak in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, Col. <PERSON> Chalermsak </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirisukha </PERSON> said: `` We have always persuaded the students and others to go home and have repeatedly insisted that anyone who is not yet ready to go back can stay here. There is no element of coercion.'' As the students marched to the plane, a <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> official shouted: `` Anyone who has any reservations about going back, please return now to your tent!'' No one did. `` I believe it's safe now to go back,'' said <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> U </PERSON>, 19. `` <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has provided us help and now I can return.'' <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Aung </PERSON>, 33, said: `` The camp administrators did not force us back. If I stay on, I can not move freely and conduct pro-democracy movements.'' Another 29 students are to fly back on Saturday. `` If I could stay, I would stay,'' said one, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Soe </PERSON> <PERSON> Moe </PERSON>.

 A flying mattress carried a 79-year-old man to safety as his suburban home was leveled by a natural gas explosion, authorities and the man said.

The explosion scattered broken glass, threw a side wall of the home against a next-door neighbor's garage, sent pieces of wood onto neighboring rooftops and gave off a blast of heat that melted the siding on a neighboring house. `` Absolutely I'm lucky,'' said <PERSON> Steurer </PERSON> as firefighters searched through the remains of his $ 50,000 wood-frame home for clues to the cause of the strange occurrence.

 An electronics company and six men, the first group indicted in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> purchasing investigation, pleaded innocent Friday to charges they paid or took money for inside information about a multimillion-dollar defense contract. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> set a trial date of March 27 for <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Newbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>; for three <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> employees, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnittjer </PERSON>; for two private consultants, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>, and for a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> purchashing official, <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>. The defendants were released on $ 10,000 personal recognizance bonds. The charges, which range from conspiracy to bribery, are contained in a 27-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury last week. They are the first resulting from the federal government's two-year-old investigation into allegations that private consultants paid bribes to defense employees for information about contracts let by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 150-billion-a-year purchasing office At the arraignment, each defendant pleaded not-guilty to all counts against him. All face charges of conspiracy and bribery, and some face other charges. <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>'s attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Patten </PERSON>, asked <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> to postpone the trial `` because we have a daunting task in front of us.'' Later, <PERSON> Patten </PERSON> said he felt his client should be afforded more time to develop its defense because the government spent over two years to work on its end. Another attorney, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, who represents <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> executive, told <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> that he has met with `` lengthy delays and stonewalling'' in trying to interview key <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees about the case. But <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, said prosecutors have `` no intention of impeding access to witnesses.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> suggested the two sides try to work out their differences before resorting to legal maneuvers. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Treanor </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, said, `` We anticipate after the trial he will be acquitted.'' <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> man, was asked whether he thought he would be exonerated. `` Sure do,'' he responded. The indictment alleges that <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> and its employees paid <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to obtain details about a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> radar contract worth more than $ 100 million. <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> then paid <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>, a consultant based in <LOCATION> Woodland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who in turn gave bribes to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, the indictment says. Prosecutors said <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s information played a role in landing the contract for <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> face maximum penalties of 185 years in prison and fines of $ 5.5 million each, if convicted on all counts. <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> faces a fine of $ 6.5 million if convicted. The other men face lesser sentences if found guilty. Prosecutors have said they plan to develop the case with the help of testimony from <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Savaides </PERSON>, a former employee of <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery. He is cooperating with prosecutors. After the indictment was made public, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> suspended <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> without pay and barred <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> from doing business with any agency of the government. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> also suspended the <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and two of its former exeutives who have entered guilty pleas in the massive <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> investigation.

 A man who spent six months in jail facing rape charges was released Friday, cleared by a DNA print test that showed he could not have been the attacker. `` We're so happy,'' said <PERSON> Sammie </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheff </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` It's been so bad. I knew he did n't do it. ... Now we can get on with our lives.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowhey </PERSON> signed an order dismissing the charges against <PERSON> Scheff </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Greenburgh </LOCATION>, after the DNA tests cleared him. In an unusual move, the district attorney's office made the dismissal motion, backing a motion <PERSON> Scheff </PERSON>'s attorney had planned to make. `` It's about time,'' said <PERSON> Scheff </PERSON>, who left court and headed back to his job as a carpenter's assistant. The dismissal came a day after a hearing during which experts declared that the DNA tests proved `` 100 percent'' that <PERSON> Scheff </PERSON> could not have raped the 21-year-old woman outside a convenience store in <LOCATION> Greenburgh </LOCATION> on Feb. 8, 1988. <PERSON> Scheff </PERSON> was arrested Feb. 25 and imprisoned until Aug. 26, when his bail was reduced from $ 50,000 to $ 500, based largely on the test results. Prosecutor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolen </PERSON> said his office would accept the DNA test results as scientific evidence. But his office asked for the hearing to determine if the tests were done properly. The victim had identified <PERSON> Scheff </PERSON> in a photo array and in a lineup, <PERSON> Bolen </PERSON> said. DNA print testing is a new, highly technical procedure based on the fact that each person's DNA, or genetic material, is unique, except in the case of identical twins. The DNA Print Identification Test offers comparisons of genetic codes by extracting the DNA from a crime scene specimen, such as semen, blood or tissue, and chemically dividing the DNA into fragments. The fragments form a pattern which serves as an identity profile. The pattern can be compared with the identity pattern from the suspect's blood specimen.

 The judge in the Iran-Contra case today dismissed the two criminal charges that accused fired <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> of illegally diverting more than $ 14 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he had no choice but to grant the motion by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to dismiss the conspiracy and theft counts against <PERSON> North </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had refused to allow use of some classified documents bearing on the charges in the trial. `` It is apparent that the attorney general and the independent counsel are unable to proceed ... -LRB- are -RRB- unwilling to proceed in connection with the conspiracy and theft charges,'' said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. `` The court is powerless to direct the case to proceed'' on the two main counts. The judge dropped the charges under a section of the Classified Information Procedures Act in which the attorney general may certify that a trial may result in the disclosure of classified information. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> made that certification in a declaration filed Thursday with <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> at the judge's request. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> last week gave up his pursuit of the conspiracy and theft of government property charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> after the administration refused to declassify portions of documents that <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said were needed in order for North to get a fair trial. Meanwhile today, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> filed a motion to quash subpoenas that <PERSON> North </PERSON> had served to compel the testimony of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when he stands trial beginning Jan. 31. The department said the two subpoenas `` raise profound constitutional concerns, not only regarding executive privilege with respect to particular information, but also regarding the authority of the courts to compel appearances by a former or sitting president.'' North's unprecedented attempt to compel a chief executive's testimony `` threatens the place of the president in the constitutional structure as head of a co-equal branch of the government,'' the department said in a brief signed by Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> The court papers disclosed that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> offered last Sept. 28 to respond in writing to `` reasonable written questions'' about the case. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has also offered to provide such written responses to relevant questions. The offer was apparently rejected by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers, and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> argued that the defense must show that they need the testimony of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for their case. At a hearing today, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> touched on one of the areas of classified material that was among the most sensitive with the administration. He pointed to the portion of his order Dec. 12 that said that in many cases the government must provide the full text of intelligence reports in open court in any trial of North. `` The court has no factual basis to question'' the classification of documents that the administration says it can not allow to be disclosed at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> embarked on an effort to protect the remaining 12 criminal charges against North from the problems of classified information that plagued the conspiracy and theft counts. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in a court filing Thursday that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s possible offenses to the other 12 counts `` are narrowly circumscribed'' and that `` the classified information problems'' affecting the conspiracy and theft charges `` should no longer be at issue.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s view clashes with the one expressed a week ago by defense attorney <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who said, `` Classified information pervades the remaining charges as well.'' At the conclusion of today's court hearing, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> announced that lawyers from both sides were to meet immediately in his chambers to discuss matters pertaining to classified information. Four of the remaining charges relate <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s alleged obstruction of inquiries in September and October 1985 by misrepresenting his activities to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said the government also will prove <PERSON> North </PERSON> denied in the 1986 presidential inquiry by Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> was involved in the diversion of an arms sale money and that <PERSON> North </PERSON> told <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> the Israelis controlled the diversion. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in the court filing Thursday that `` the government's case no longer depends on proving that the proceeds of the Iranian arms sales constituted government property, or that by diverting those proceeds to the Contras, <PERSON> North </PERSON> embezzled them. He said `` classified information problems affecting Counts One and Two -LRB- the conspiracy and theft charges -RRB- should no longer be an issue.'' Still, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> may attempt to bring classified information into the case by saying that he covered up his activities because superiors directed him to or because everything he did was `` authorized and perfectly legal.'' Under neither approach should North be permitted `` to import classified information,'' said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said Monday that while motive does not determine guilt or innocence under the law, <PERSON> North </PERSON> has a right to show the activities he sought to cover up were not illegal. North might then seek to bring in some of the same classified information that led <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to abandon the conspiracy and theft charges. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said the government would prove <PERSON> North </PERSON> solicited funds for the Contras from private donors, helped Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> obtain weapons, played a role in the Contras' opening a southern front and provided military advice and intelligence. Since that alleged assistance predates <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, proof of the legality or illegality of diverting money to the Contras from those arms sales is irrelevant, said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said `` what is not at issue'' in connection with the counts concerning the attorney general's inquiry is whether <PERSON> North </PERSON> was authorized to divert funds or believed he was authorized. The independent counsel also said <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` should not be permitted to introduce evidence that earlier in 1986, the Attorney General or the President allegedly had some fragmentary knowledge of North's conduct. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s filing also disclosed new information on the allegation <PERSON> North </PERSON> made personal use of travelers checks supplied by <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said that on four occasions involving six checks, <PERSON> North </PERSON> spent them on `` official travel for which he sought and received government reimbursement.'' According to testimony at congressional hearings in 1987, <PERSON> North </PERSON> had spent some of the travelers checks at local merchants. Those checks are mentioned in the indictment. According to <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> on three occasions involving half a dozen travelers checks spent the money on private travel for himself or his family.

<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, said Friday the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is preventing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors from X-raying containers leaving a Soviet missile assembly plant and is therefore violating the treaty banning medium-range, nuclear-armed missiles. But the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it expects full Soviet cooperation when the X-ray equipment is ready to be installed and is satisfied that existing procedures will enable the detection of any banned medium-range SS-20 missile attempting to leave the factory. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is satisfied with the implementation of the ... treaty to date,'' said department spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON>. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, in a letter to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, called inspection rights at Votkinsk the `` heart and keystone'' of the treaty's verification system and said that under the treaty's terms the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspection team should have been able to X-ray all items leaving the factory by last Dec. 1, six months after the treaty went into effect. `` The package of procedures that the Soviets obligated themselves to allow have not been agreed, in part because the Soviets have made unacceptable demands for other procedures and provisions,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. `` Because of this failure to agree to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> X-ray rights, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> X-ray equipment is still not installed at <LOCATION> Votkinsk </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> what he intends to do to `` prevent the Soviets from continuing to exploit their potential to cheat at Votkinsk'' and added: `` Due to Soviet intransigence, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has been totally unable to monitor effectively or verify whether the Soviets have continued to manufacture or deploy perhaps dozens of banned SS-20 missiles from the Votkinsk factory for the last eight months that the treaty has been in force.'' But at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON> said that any problem was a minor one. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agrees fully with the right of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to install that kind of equipment,'' <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON> said, adding that the Soviets will have the same X-raying privileges at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facility at <ORGANIZATION> Magna </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. `` We are now in the final stage of working out of the details of implementing this right,'' <PERSON> Redmon </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is in the final stage of testing the appropriate equipment for this particular verification method.'' `` When we are fully ready to install our equipment we expect the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will cooperate with us fully,'' he said. A 30-person <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team continuously monitors the Votkinsk facility and has inspected every vehicle leaving it large enough to contain an SS-20, <PERSON> Redmon </PERSON> said. Additionally. he said the inspection team is `` opening randomly selected SS-25 canisters.'' `` This particular monitoring activity is but one element of a comprehensive set of verification procedures,'' <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Postal Drug Tests May Indicate Problem Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 People who tested positive for drugs in pre-employment screening, but were hired anyway, had sharply higher absentee rates and were much more likely to be fired than other workers, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. Once on the job, people who had positive drug tests had a 43 percent higher absentee rate and were 40 percent more likely to be fired than workers who tested clean of drugs, the agency said. `` We're doing actual work force performance factors. Attendance and involuntary turnover are the first ones -LRB- in which -RRB- we see a strong relationship at this point in the study,'' said Assistant Postmaster General <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trosch </PERSON> in a telephone interview. `` Frankly, I anticipate some of the relationships we see getting stronger and I will not be surprised if we see other relationships'' such as accident rates, he said. `` Even these first interim results provide significant support for a business decision to say no to applicants who test positive for drugs,'' added <PERSON> Trosch </PERSON>, who handles employee relations. The drug tests were not used in deciding whether to hire the employees involved, although the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is planning to institute pre-employment drug screening for all new workers over the next 30 days, <PERSON> Trosch </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, is considering whether such testing should be subject to bargaining between the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and its unions. The test results reported Friday came from a program involving 4,375 workers hired at 21 sites around the country over nine months. The report covered the first six months of work for those people. It is planned to continue for a full two years. In the test, designed by the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> consultation, job applicants were screened for drugs before being hired. However, local managers were not informed of the results of the tests. They made hiring decisions based on written exams and interviews, as with any postal worker, officials said. In the study, 5,465 applicants were screened for drugs. Of them, 4,375 were eventually hired by the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, and 4,220 were evaluated in this study because they had completed their six-month probationary period. A subsequent analysis found that 515 applicants had tested positive, of which 354 had been hired by the agency. Marijuana was the most common drug found, being detected in 232 cases. Of those hired, 88 had tested positive for cocaine and 34 for other drugs, according to the report. Of all those hired, 361 have since been fired by the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for one reason or another, the report said. That group included 42 people who had tested positive for drugs and 319 who had tested negative. The study found those using drugs made up 8.4 percent of the evaluated group of people hired. The firing rate for drug users was 40 percent higher than for non-users. In addition, the agency totaled up the sick leave, leave without pay and time spent absent without leave for both groups. While it did not report detailed numbers in this category, the agency said that those who had tested positive for drugs were absent from work at a rate 43 percent greater than those who tested negative. `` Our study is the first in which we are ... comparing performance of individuals who test positive and who test negative in an actual work setting,'' <PERSON> Trosch </PERSON> said. In reporting the preliminary figures, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> added that turnover and absenteeism are only two of many areas that are potentially affected by whether workers use drugs. `` Other productivity savings may result from reductions in accidents, injuries, benefit claims, etc.,'' the report said. Statistics on those topics are expected to be included as the test continues. The 21 postal centers involved in the test are <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>; two hiring centers in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and two hiring centers in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>.

 Authorities in three states arrested 19 motorcyle club members or their associates early Friday on federal racketeering, drug and firearms charges. A federal indictment names 29 members or associates of members of the <ORGANIZATION> Pagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motorcycle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, including the group's national president and vice-president, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>. Authorities have leads on the members not yet arrested, he said. Separate indictments name six non-club members as part of the biker investigation, and it was not clear Friday afternoon how many of the 19 were Pagan members. <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said the Pagans, which has chapters throughout the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, is considered among the most dangerous such clubs in the country. `` They've commited virtually any crime you can name,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> state police sergeant who has been involved in operations against the Pagans for 13 years. More than eight kilograms of cocaine, 4,000 doses of LSD and several ounces of methamphetamine were seized or bought during the investigation, <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. Besides <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, arrests were made Friday in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. And search warrants were issued in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> in connection with the investigation. A federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> charged 29 people on Tuesday, and the 85-count indictment was unsealed Friday, <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. The six non-members were named in five indictments. Pagan membership stands at about 280, with 130 of that number in prison, <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> said the arrests would weaken the club, but he said retaliation is possible. `` They have burned houses of witnesses, made threats. ... They are a violent organization,'' <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> said. `` They react violently to intimidation, and that's what they view this as.'' Club President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Delp </PERSON> of Alliance, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, is charged with racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, interstate travel in aid of racketeering and distribution of controlled substances. <PERSON> Delp </PERSON> is under arrest, according to a spokesman for <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>. If convicted on all counts, <PERSON> Delp </PERSON> would face a life sentence and fines of up to $ 7.75 million, <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. The vice president, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Blain </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillion </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, is charged with racketeering. <PERSON> McMillion </PERSON> would face 20 years in prison and fines of up to $ 250,000 if convicted, <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McMillion </PERSON> is still at large. The 17 people who were arrested in the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> area probably will be arraigned later this afternoon, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magistrate </ORGANIZATION>'s Office said. Those arrested in other states will be arraigned at the nearest magistrate court, she said. Members are being held by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal in various locations. None of those arrested was available for comment until after their court hearings, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal's office in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> said. Calls to three attorneys representing Pagans in the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> area were not immediately returned. Others arrested had not yet obtained counsel, according to the magistrate's office.

<HEAD>Easy Approval Seen For FAA-Controllers Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Union leaders on Friday predicted easy approval of the first labor contract for air traffic controllers since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> fired 11,400 of them during a strike eight years ago. The new three-year contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Admnistration </ORGANIZATION> will help ensure air safety, said <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, president of the year-old <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controllers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. It gives controllers guaranteed breaks, limited immunity in reporting system errors and participation in accident investigations and some <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> decision-making. The tentative agreement signed late Thursday in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> does not cover salaries, which are set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and range between $ 19,000 and $ 55,000 annually. But <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said new FAA-union `` professional councils'' would be set up. He added that such labor-management cooperation could lead to increased compensation, better working hours and more health benefits. Both sides described the talks as evidence of vastly improved relations between the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and its 13,000 controllers since the 1981 illegal strike that led to the bankruptcy and decertification of their old union. More than half the controllers, who monitor and control air traffic at 400 sites around the country, have joined the new bargaining unit. `` It's a clear victory for both the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and the union,'' said <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, predicting that the agreement would be approved in a vote by union members within the next few weeks. `` It represents a new spirit of cooperation between labor and management at <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, in sharp contrast to past problems,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON>. He said talks with the new union went smoothly, while the old union used to begin by asking for such things as Olympic-sized swimming pools at each <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> site and other costly benefits the government agency had no authority to provide. `` The new contract goes a long way toward helping airline safety,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` What it contains is a safety system contract between the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and controllers and with the American flying public.'' The contract would for the first time guarantee controllers a break away from any controller duties after two hours monitoring air traffic. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said controllers often are worked for two hours straight and then switched to another duty without a break. The return of limited controller immunity, eliminated before the 1981 strike, would allow workers to report errors and system deficiencies without fear of retribution, as long as they did not involve negligence. `` The system, if errors were made and reported, tended to be punitive in nature rather than preventative,'' said <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>. He said management gave up none of its rights to discipline employees. The contract would also include controllers on boards that review system errors and in groups that oversee technical development of the system and evaluate facilities. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> was heretofore a little bit testy with allowing controllers to get into the procedure aspect of the job,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> also agreed to quickly release controllers from duties for participation in accident investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Controllers have not been included on official investigative teams since the old contract, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Grazing Fees Rising on Federal Land</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grazing fees on most federal land will be raised by 21 percent March 1, partly because of higher beef prices, two federal agencies said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, part of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, part of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the new fee for grazing in national forests and on public land administered by the bureau in the West will be $ 1.86 per animal per month, up 32 cents from the previous year. By presidential directive, the two agencies use the same formula to set grazing fees. The formula rises and falls with beef prices, among other factors. <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said `` the prices farmers and ranchers received for beef cattle increased by 9 percent, and private grazing land lease rates increased in most of the states involved.'' For grazing fees, the agencies consider one animal to be a horse or burro, five sheep or goats, or a cow and a calf. The new fees apply to national forests in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, and on bureau lands in those states plus <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. For national grasslands in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will charge $ 2.29, an increase of 46 cents or 25 percent. About 3 percent of the nation's beef supply is grazed on public lands while on the hoof.

 Twenty-five years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarrants </PERSON> firebombed and shot at civil rights workers, blacks, Jews and law enforcement officers. Today, <PERSON> Tarrants </PERSON> is a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> businessman and Mennonite minister who says he regrets his younger days. He now prays the people he once terrorized will have lives free of violence and memories free of bitterness. <PERSON> Tarrants </PERSON> has built a new life, removed from his life as a member of the White Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. He married into one of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s most prominent families and is the father of two young daughters. He renounced his life in the Klan in 1970, and <PERSON> Tarrants </PERSON> says he is now developing a private ministry to bring business people and professionals to God. `` I have prayed for the people we hurt, we killed, we terrorized. I have deep feelings for them and about those who helped me do it,'' the 42-year-old <PERSON> Tarrants </PERSON> said in a telephone interview this week with the <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. As one of the inner circle of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Klan leaders during the 1960s, <PERSON> Tarrants </PERSON> said he participated in dozens of church and residential bombings in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Meridian </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tarrants </PERSON> was admitted to the Klan hierarchy immediately after the June 1964 murders of three civil rights workers in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, Miss. His underground collection of friends and confidants _ including the <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>'s Imperial Wizard, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Klansman </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, both convicted of charges connected with the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> killings _ read like the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s most-wanted list. Under <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> surveillance from 1964 to 1968, <PERSON> Tarrants </PERSON> was arrested three times, once with <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON>. In June 1968, his Klan activity ended in a violent shootout with <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who converged on <PERSON> Tarrants </PERSON> as he tried to firebomb the <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION> home of <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, a Jewish businessman. His old friend <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who turned <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informant after his conviction in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> killings, leaked the bombing plans, <PERSON> Tarrants </PERSON> said. After a trial in <ORGANIZATION> Meridian </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tarrants </PERSON> was sentenced to 30 years at the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Parchman </LOCATION> for the attempted bombing. He was paroled Dec. 13, 1976. `` I've put my past behind me, but there's still so much each of us can do to make things right,'' said <PERSON> Tarrants </PERSON>, who wrote a book on his experiences, `` The Conversion of a Klansman,'' published in 1979. With national attention focused on the Klan's reign of terror in the recently released movie `` Mississippi Burning,'' <PERSON> Tarrants </PERSON> said the nightmares are creeping back. `` I try not to think about it. Frankly, I do n't know if I'll even go see the movie, but I may,'' <PERSON> Tarrants </PERSON> said. `` My wife is interested. She's curious.

<HEAD>Bush's Choice For Energy Chief Raises Doubts In Oil Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice of an energy secretary with nuclear expertise but no experience in other energy fields drew little praise and some concern Friday from industry and environmental groups. In announcing his selection of Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> would oversee the daunting task of repairing the department's crippled nuclear weapons complex. Safety and other problems recently forced the closing of the country's only facilities producing tritium, a vital ingredient for nuclear warheads. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> was trained in nuclear reactor engineering early in his 41-year <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> career, worked in the Naval nuclear office of the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and later commanded a nuclear-power submarine. But he has no professional experience in the conventional energy areas, such as oil and natural gas, that are more commonly associated with the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` You're touching me on my Achilles' heel,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said in response to a news conference question Thursday about his views on how to shore up domestic oil prices. This admitted weakness, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clear interest in focusing on problems in the nuclear weapons complex, has caused some concern about how the new administration will address other energy issues such as the growing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependence on foreign oil. `` Our initial reaction is definitely one of disappointment,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Haywood </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a producers trade group. `` We had hoped for someone who could come in knowing the domestic oil business,'' he said, adding that he expected <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> to be a `` quick study.'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobowski </PERSON>, an energy analyst at the Wall Street firm of <ORGANIZATION> Paine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Webber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said oil industry executives had figured <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would pick `` somebody who was a bit more of an advocate'' for their interests on Capitol Hill. In part, the selection of a military official to head energy policy reflects a declining emphasis within the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on civilian energy issues. In the current fiscal year the department is spending 58 percent of its $ 15 billion budget on defense programs; in 1982 the defense share was 28 percent. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, representing natural gas producers, hailed <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' `` proven managerial skills'' and said his nuclear background will help in solving the nuclear defense problems. But, he said, `` It is especially important that this national security issue be handled skillfully ... so it does not become an abiding distraction to other energy issues.'' The natural gas industry's main concern about leadership in the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is that it help win congressional approval to end the remaining price controls on gas. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has pushed aside suggestions that oil executives need worry about his choice. `` They've got a president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that came out of the oil and gas industry, that knows it and knows it well,'' he said Thursday. Some analysts said the <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> choice appeared to reflect a relaxed attitude by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about the possibility of a new oil crisis developing in the 1990s. `` It suggests the -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- administration does n't see a major problem in fossil fuels in the near future,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtblau </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which is supported by oil industry funds. He added that he disagrees with this view and is concerned that if the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> cartel falls into disarray again, oil prices could fall low enough to harm <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security. Environmental groups also expressed mild concern about <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> environmental organization, said he hoped the choice of <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> `` does not reflect a decision to place military production needs ahead of safety and the environment.'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reicher </PERSON>, an attorney for the environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said his group was worried that nuclear defense needs would get too much attention in an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> headed by a career military man. `` We are concerned that the appointment of Adm. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> signals that cleaning up the bomb plants and developing a sound national energy policy will continue to be sacrificed in the name of nuclear weapons production,'' <PERSON> Reicher </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Architect <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s former home at <LOCATION> Taliesin </LOCATION> needs a five-year, $ 16 million restoration and should be opened as a tourist attraction, according to members of a state commission studying the site. Commission members say they plan to recommend creation of a non-profit corporation to undertake the restoration and oversee operation of the landmark. Some state money would be involved, but most would be raised from corporations, foundations and private donors, commission members said. <LOCATION> Taliesin </LOCATION>, built in 1911 on 600 acres amid the rolling hills of southwestern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and declared a national landmark in 1976, now is a school for architects. Commission members said they were optimistic the plan would win the blessings of the <LOCATION> Taliesin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fellowship </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and other state officials, and that restoration would start soon. The commission expects 200,000 to 250,000 people to visit <LOCATION> Taliesin </LOCATION> annually. The site also would be available for national and international conferences. `` There are some unknowns since there's quite a lot of logistics involved in handling that many people,'' said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the study commission. `` But the commission is not looking at the state as a great pot of money.'' There is some disagreement among commission members about how to perform the restoration, said <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Erdman </PERSON>, a builder, architect and former <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> student who heads the state commission. `` We want to do it right,'' he said. `` If we do it incorrectly, there's no use doing it. On the other hand, we have to deal with practicalities. And fortunately, unlike most restoration work, we still have people who were there on the site, so we can save a lot of effort and research.'' Air conditioning, a new heating systems and better glass bonding would make <LOCATION> Taliesin </LOCATION> comfortable year round, <PERSON> Erdman </PERSON> said. `` A lot of the things we're doing is the way it should have been done had Mr. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had the resources and technology we have today,'' <PERSON> Erdman </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>New Rule Would Deny Payment To Those Giving Substandard Care</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government agency that administers <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> proposed a new rule Friday to deny payment under the program to hospitals and physicians that deliver substandard hospital inpatient care. The new rule would enhance the government's ability `` to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receive high-quality care,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. In proposing the rule, the agency complies with instructions from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The agency said the rule was not expected to have a `` substantial impact on a significant number of small entities or small rural hospitals.'' Under the rule, peer review organizations, composed of physicians in each state and under contract to the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to review health-care services funded under <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, would be authorized to deny <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> payments when substandard care harms a patient or places the patient at high risk. The rule prohibits physicians and hospitals from charging patients for services for which payment was denied because of poor-quality care. When the review groups find that care is substandard but does not result in harm to the patient or present imminent danger, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> will pay for the claim but the review group will conduct a follow-up review and work with the provider to correct the problem. Currently, when review groups find poor care being delivered, they are limited to remedial action, which includes discussing the case with the hospital or physician, intensifying future reviews and recommending sanctions.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A car bomb exploded in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Friday minutes after thousands of pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems marched by in a demonstration against their Syrian-backed rivals. Seven people were killed and 15 wounded, police said. The blast occurred on the sixth day of fierce fighting between the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia and the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> for control of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> and the country's 1 million Shiites. The <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> blew up on <LOCATION> Roweiss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, a residential area in the <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Abed </LOCATION> district. It touched off several fires and blasted a crater in the street six feet deep and more than seven feet across. The force of the explosion catapulted a flaming car onto a power pole. `` A tongue of flame pierced the sky when the deafening blast occurred. I was hurled a few yards off and then landed on my belly with glass raining on me,'' said <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON>, interviewed in front of his tool shop. At least 10 cars were destroyed. More than 16 buildings suffered considerable damage in a one-mile radius around the blast. At least nine shops were destroyed. Broken power cables dangled on streets littered with glass shards and uprooted pine trees. Police said the dead were civilians who lingered after thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> protesters passed by minutes before. Some demonstrators carried placards and chanted slogans such as `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the Great Satan!'' and `` Death to <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>!'' <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> heads <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, which is backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. `` If it happened during the demonstration, it would have been a much greater disaster with plenty of more casualties,'' said a police spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> gunmen shot in the air to clear a path for ambulances. At one point they stopped a team of civil defense workers, beat five of them, blindfolded them and then dumped them into the trunk of a car and sped away. `` They are suspects,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> gunman, who refused to give his name. Syrian troops in charge of security in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem sector watched but did not intervene. A <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> statement said none of the party leaders or partisans who took part in the demonstration was injured. No one claimed responsibility for the blast. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militiamen claimed <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> was behind it, but an <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> statement disclaimed involvement, calling the blast `` an intolerable act of terrorism aimed at fanning the flames of dissension within the Shiite community.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s parade was called to protest what the party termed `` the murderous military adventure'' by <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> to evict <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION>. Militiamen of the two factions battled Friday with mortars and machine guns in and around the Apple Province village of <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION>, but none made territorial gains. Police said two civilians were killed and another three wounded. <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION> is the key to a 9-square-mile enclave controlled by about 500 <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters. It extends south to the hamlets of <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouswar </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Louwaizeh </LOCATION> and east to wooded <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Safi </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, called for an end to the fighting. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, speaking in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> `` are both committing murder, and the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> is disgusted.''

<HEAD>Canada Unlikely to Resolve Any U.S. Tritium Shortage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tritium, a gas that strengthens nuclear bombs, is a byproduct of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s nuclear power plants, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should n't look to the north for a way to ease a shortage caused by problems in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons plants. `` It would not be amenable,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>. `` In peacetime certainly it would not be amenable. Certainly we would not countenance sales directly to the weapons system.'' Anti-nuclear activists allege that any exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be virtually impossible to track in their civilian or military uses. `` Even if our tritium is n't used directly in military weapons systems, which we suspect it will be, it will free up their scarce supplies,'' <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> of the Nuclear Awareness Project said in a telephone interview. The <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> source of the radioactive isotope of hydrogen, is closed because of safety problems. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> has recommended building two new production reactors, at a cost of $ 8.6 billion. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> needs to replenish the tritium, which decays at a rate of 5.5 percent a year, in its warheads. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear industry is based on light-water reactors, which use water as a coolant and other materials as moderators _ slowing the neutrons enough so they cause fission. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s 18 reactors use heavy water _ in which hydrogen is replaced by the isotope deuterium _ as coolant and moderator. One byproduct of the reaction is tritium, which also has some commercial and industrial applications, including in emergency lighting devices. `` Right now the plan is to remove the tritium and then store it on site,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` We still have n't made that decision to sell any of it, let alone export any of it to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' The question of exports came up in the debate over the plant 47 miles east of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, `` mainly from the critics who oppose this,'' he said `` It's very much an issue for us. It has been for a couple of years,'' said <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, whose group is pressuring the <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> provincial government to refuse permission for any tritium exports. The federal government also would have to license exports of radioactive materials, and <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has one of the world's most stringest systems of safeguards against nuclear exports for any military purposes It requires countries with recognized nuclear capacities _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ to agree that no Canadian materials will be used for weapons. In general, other countries must have `` full-scope safeguards'' to obtain Canadian materials, and must allow international inspection of all nuclear facilities. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was cut off in 1974. It also is recognized that exports for peaceful uses free a supply for weapons systems, although that has not come up in any debate, <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said. `` I know the Americans know our safeguard concerns and in many ways share them.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has not approached the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> government for tritium, he said. `` It really has n't come up.''

 Most older Americans support a new national health insurance program that pays the catastrophic costs of major illness, according to a poll released Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>. The new health insurance law, which took effect Jan. 1, will cover extended hospitalizations and help pay high prescription-drug bills. It will be financed by premiums paid by all Medicare enrollees, a sore point among some retirees. The poll of 1,750 people age 45 and older found 71 percent supported the program while 15 percent opposed it. Among the 657 who were age 65 and older, 65 percent supported the program and 21 percent opposed it. <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> said the finding that concerns them most is that more than half of those questioned said they were not familiar with the program. `` There a great need to get the facts out,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION>'s director of legislation, research and public policy. `` Even those familiar with it are in fact misinformed'' about aspects of the program, he added. The 28-million-member <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> supports the catastrophic illness program and has started a campaign to educate senior citizens about its benefits. Some retirees are upset they will have to pay for coverage whether they want it or not and say they could do better buying private insurance. The major financing provision of the program has been the target of most complaints. It requires everyone eligible for Medicare who pays more than $ 150 in federal income taxes to pay an extra premium based on the amount of tax they own. The maximum surtax on any person is $ 800 this year, or $ 1,600 for a couple if both spouses are eligible. Such a couple would have income of at least $ 70,000. Overall, 58 percent of those polled said they viewed the supplemental premium based on tax liability as positive. However, a majority of those surveyed said they did not like having only those over 65 pay for it. Overall, 52 percent viewed this as a negative aspect of the program, compared with 42 percent who said was it was positive. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said he was gratified by the poll results and anticipates no change in the tax. `` It offers security and peace of mind to older Americans and the vast majority of them understand and appreciate that,'' he said in a statement. The poll was conducted by telephone Dec. 2-18. Results have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for the entire group of 1,750 and 4 points for the subgroup of those age 65 and older.

<HEAD>Four Killed, 200 Wounded In Sikh-Hindu Clash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JAMMU, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hindus and Sikhs fought with guns and swords Friday during a religious procession honoring two Sikhs executed for the assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandi </PERSON>, authorities and witnesses said. Civil administrator N.R. <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> said at least four people, including a Sikh trapped in a burning truck, were killed. About 200 people were injured, and more than 200 shops were looted and set ablaze, he said. The government of <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state imposed a curfew on the northern city and ordered police to shoot violators. Police opened fire several times and used tear gas to try to stop the fighting, but it continued until 1,000 army troops arrived more than five hours later, <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> said. Witnesses said the fighting started shortly after about 2,000 Sikhs left a temple on a procession in honor of <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who were hanged last week and now are revered as martyrs of the Sikh faith. Many carried pictures as the eight-mile procession moved through a Hindu neighborhood, and a group of militant Hindus asked the Sikhs to remove the pictures, the witnesses said. One Sikh pulled a dagger and lunged at the Hindus, who retaliated, they said. <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION>, 40 miles north of Sikh-dominated <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, has a population of about 500,000. Of these, about 80,000 are <PERSON> Sikhs </PERSON>, about 300,000 are Hindus and the rest are Moslems. <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> were executed for the assassination of Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, who was killed Oct. 31, 1984, in apparent retaliation for an army raid she had ordered on the Sikhs' holy Golden Temple. Sikh militants were using the temple as a base for their fight for an independent homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state. The assassination caused anti-Sikh riots in many northern cities, including <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION>. More than 2,700 people died, most of them Sikhs. Sikhs comprise 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people but are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Sikh militants claim discrimination by <PERSON> Hindus </PERSON>, who comprise 80 percent of the country's population.

<HEAD>They're Fighting For Tickets To The Texas Black Tie And Boots Ball</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Competition to go to the hottest inaugural week party _ the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> _ has led to a political scrap over Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>'s decision to give some of the $ 50 tickets to those contributing $ 1,000 to his re-election campaign. So intense is the fight for tickets that people have put ads in newspapers. One man was offered a free trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> if he relinquished his tickets and others have reportedly scalped theirs for $ 500 each. Described as an event where you can `` let your hair down, grab a beer and kick your boots off,'' this ball is a big draw this year because President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, an adopted Texan, is expected to show up with 5,500 other guests. Organizers initially planned for 4,500 people, but rented more space at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Hilton to accommodate demand. Unlike many events over the glittery inaugural week, the ball is not sanctioned by the official inaugural committee. Instead, the bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, made up of Texans or would-be Texans, is hosting the Jan. 21 party as it has for the past two inaugurations. Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON> is the society's chairman At the center of the controversy is <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, a first-term Republican who is using the inauguration to raise money for his 1990 re-election campaign. For a $ 1,000 contribution, <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> offered his supporters membership in the <ORGANIZATION> Gramm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. During inaugural week, board members are invited to a lunch with a Cabinet officer and attend a reception with VIPs. They were also given tickets to the ball, until supplies ran out, according to fund-raiser <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>. The inaugural package is expected to bring in between $ 100,000 and $ 150,000 for the senator, <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> said. <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> said he bought 300 tickets right after they went on sale Dec. 14. At the request of the society, he and others who purchased big blocks of tickets later returned 10 percent of them. <PERSON> Chino </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON>'s spokesman, said <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>'s campaign was by far the largest purchaser of tickets. Tickets were automatically sent to the society's 3,000 members, while others were made available by the society. Some of the criticism has come from Democrats upset that <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> has used to bipartisan ball as a way to make money. `` The black tie and boots thing is indicative of the way <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> operates,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's always <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> first,'' he said Republicans have been more tempered, but <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, a spokesman for Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, holder of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s old congressional seat, said it would have been `` totally unethical'' to resell tickets at a higher price. <PERSON> Archer </PERSON>'s office, which has been inundated with requests, bought about 20 tickets and then sold them at the same price to constituents, he said. `` A lot of folks from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ca n't understand why they ca n't get in,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, an aide to Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Armey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>'s spokesman, said the office had heard a lot of complaints about the ball, but most of them came from Democrats. He said it was `` not particularly surprising'' to find complaints coming from the party that lost the election. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> was traveling in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Friday and was not available for comment. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>'s aides defended the senator's fund-raising. They said the $ 1,000 contribution bought more than the $ 50 ticket, and about two-thirds of the black tie and boots ball tickets were given to people who contributed money to the campaign earlier. <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> said the society should have done a better job in dividing up the tickets for what he said promised to be a `` cattle show.'' `` They would n't have had this problem except that people from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and all over want to come. They should have limited it to people with a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> driver's license.'' `` Next time we will recommend imposing limits on the tickets you can buy,'' <PERSON> Chapa </PERSON> said. Despite the ball's popularity, some, like <PERSON> Armey </PERSON>, are avoiding it. `` He ca n't stand wearing a black tie,'' <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said, adding: `` He does n't drink ... He does his smoozing on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor.''

 Farmers planted 54.5 million acres of winter wheat last fall for harvest in 1989, a 12 percent increase from 1988 and the most in four years, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following year. It accounts for about three-fourths of the total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat output. Production was reduced last year by drought, and brisk export demand has helped reduce stockpiles. With greater demand, prices have risen substantially the past year. Also, farmers are being required to idle only 10 percent of their wheat base acres for 1989 in order to qualify for government price supports, compared with 27.5 percent previously. `` All states increased acreage from 1988 except <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in its report. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennesee </LOCATION> are unchanged.'' In <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, the largest producer, wheat plantings jumped 22 percent to 12.4 million acres. Nationally, the 54.5 million acres of winter wheat planted for 1989 is the largest acreage since 57.8 million acres were planted for the 1985 harvest, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> records. `` Seeding of this year's crop kicked off in August in several states,'' the report said. `` Progress moved along by varying degrees, reaching about 97 percent as of Dec. 1. By mid-December, seeding was finished except for parts of the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' In a supply-and-demand analysis, officials said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> total wheat stockpile on June 1, the beginning of the 1989-90 wheat marketing year, could be whittled to around 534 million bushels, less than half the 1.26 billion bushels in the June 1, 1988, inventory. It was more than 1.82 billion bushels on June 1, 1987. Export subsidies and other government programs have helped boost wheat sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other foreign buyers. Total shipments in 1988-89 are expected to be around 1.5 billion bushels, more than double the 700 million bushels needed to cover <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domestic food requirements. Meanwhile, wheat prices at the farm have risen to a predicted range in the current marketing year of $ 3.60 to $ 3.75 per bushel, on the average, compared with $ 2.57 in 1987-88 and $ 2.42 in 1986-87. A comparable situation has developed for some other grains hit by last year's drought. Corn prices, for example, were forecast at an average of $ 2.30 to $ 2.70 per bushel in the 1988-89 marketing year that runs through August, compared with $ 1.94 last season and $ 1.50 in 1986-87. Another report showed the Dec. 1 inventory of corn at 7.07 billion bushels, down 28 percent from a year earlier. The wheat inventory, at 1.71 billion bushels, was down 32 percent from Dec. 1, 1987. Soybean stocks as of Dec. 1 were reported at 1.37 billion bushels, down 22 percent from a year earlier. A review of overall 1988 crop production showed relatively minor adjustments in <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s previously announced harvest figures, with the exception of corn. Last year's corn harvest was reported at 4.92 billion bushels, up from 4.67 billion bushels estimated last November. Even so, the 1988 corn harvest was down 30 percent from 1987 production, with the drought-reduced yield averaging 84.6 bushels per acre, compared with the record level of 119.4 bushels per acre in 1987. The 1988 harvest of all wheat was a decade low of 1.81 billion bushels, down 14 percent from 1987, and soybeans last year totaled 1.54 billion bushels, 20 percent below 1987 production. Cotton output, at 15.4 million bales, was up 5 percent from 1987 and was the most in seven years.

 The West German finance minister said Friday his government had `` some new information'' to link firms in his country with the construction of a plant in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says was designed to develop chemical weapons. But the West German official said criminal prosecution would proceed only if there was `` complete evidence.'' <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> pledged after a one-hour meeting with Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> that `` whatever it takes to get information, it will be followed.'' Meanwhile, West German and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts held a second day of meetings on the intelligence the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has used to support its claim that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was trying to develop chemical weapons at the plant, some 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. `` We are trying to provide as much information as possible,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said. He said the talks at an undisclosed location would be `` useful and productive,'' but provided no other details. Separate British and Dutch investigations also point to an attempt by Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s country to develop chemical weapons. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said last week the Libyans had not reached the point of production. <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON>, in a curbside news conference outside the department, renewed allegations that West German firms had been targeted for criticism by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media. `` What we did not like in some <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> press comments,'' he said, `` was to single out <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> because it is obvious that it could have been a problem of quite a few other countries.'' The finance minister said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> should join in promoting international cooperation to prevent technology transfers to countries which could produce chemical weapons to endanger world security. Officials of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government last week registered skepticism that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had evidence to link West German firms to the plant, which <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said was producing pharmaceuticals. However, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said Thursday in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> that authorities had seized new documents that may show firms helped the North African country build a chemical plant. On Friday, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Frey </PERSON>, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in <LOCATION> Karlsrube </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> there would be an investigation into the Imhausen-Chemie company. <PERSON> Frey </PERSON> said the possible charge being investigated was `` a violation of the export control law.'' He did not elaborate. Imhausen-Chemie has denied any connection to the Libyan plant. <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said the evidence came from West German sources. `` There was no proof a week ago,'' he said, `` and now there is some new information in the last days ... which could lead to criminal prosecution.'' But he said `` it's not a final decision ... We must have complete evidence -LRB- to prosecute -RRB-. Whatever it takes to get information, it will be followed.'' Referring to the dispute with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the West German official said `` we have really made progress in understanding.''

 The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency on Friday raised serious doubts about a story it ran on the miraculous survival of six men trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building for 35 days after the Armenian earthquake. In an urgent dispatch headlined `` One Always Wants Miracles,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said it had n't found a single eyewitness to confirm a <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> resident's tale that he and five others survived for five weeks on canned goods in a dark, cramped food cellar. `` Everyone wanted to believe in the <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> miracle,'' the news agency said. `` Regrettably, we are unable so far to confirm with full certainty the authenticity of the reports made by our Armenian colleagues ... nor can we categorically deny them,'' it said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, whose initials stand for the `` <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' is run by the state and is used to distribute news and offical proclamations of the government. In the years before President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> instituted his policy of greater openness, or `` glasnost,'' the Soviet press was highly restricted in what it reported. Natural disasters and accidents rarely found their way into the national press. Its reporting on the devastating earthquake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, as well as other recent disasters, has been unusually candid. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> first ran the story Thursday, a day after the reported rescue. In its dispatch Friday, it said it could not find the other five survivors, the rescuers or any witnesses to the incident that made headlines around the world. Officials gave up hope weeks ago of finding more survivors in the Dec. 7 quake, which killed 25,000 people. They began bulldozing the ruins to prevent decaying bodies from spreading disease. But <PERSON> Aikaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON>, a 50-year-old electrician admitted to a <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> hospital Thursday with pneumonia, offered <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> a detailed report of his five-week entombment. Psychiatrists examined <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> and found him normal, and reporters found acquaintances who confirmed <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON>'s identity and former residence in the ruined apartment building, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> remembers the five young men perfectly well,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. They said he suggested the other five survivors mut have traveled to relatives in another village. But neighbors in the area of the ruined building told two correspondents from the Soviet newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> that they knew nothing of a rescue Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Leninakan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirakosian </PERSON> walked down the street with the <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reporters Thursday and told them the last survivors in the city were found Dec. 26, the newspaper said in its Friday afternoon editions. Earlier attempts to find the rescuers were hampered by the fact that there is still only one telephone line to <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Armenpress </ORGANIZATION>, the Armenian news agency that is affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> as saying the six survived because they were buried in a cellar used to store canned vegetables, smoked ham, stewed fruit and pickles. He said he sang and told stories in the pitch-dark room to keep the others from going crazy. Soviet media leaped on the story. The evening news program `` Vremya'' interviewed <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> in his hospital bed Thursday night, and Friday morning's <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> published a large photo of <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> on its back page, headlined, `` And still there are survivors!'' The <ORGANIZATION> Communisty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda ran the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report on page three under a small headline, `` More than one month underground,'' and <ORGANIZATION> Moskovskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> offered the same article with the title, `` Freed from captivity in the rocks.'' But Friday's <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> was skeptical. `` 35 days under the rubble?'' read the headline. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Armenpress </PERSON> first heard of <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON>'s tale from <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunyan </PERSON>, head of health and social security for the <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>. `` The first thought which crossed the mind was, ` It is impossible,''' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. But <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Kirill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dibrova </PERSON> interviewed <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> in the hospital, and believed him. <PERSON> Ashot </PERSON> <PERSON> Adomyan </PERSON>, deputy chief physician at Hospital No. 3, also believes the story, the news agency said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted the doctor as saying it is natural for a man trapped in a basement for more than a month to develop pneumonia. In addition, <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> arrived at the hospital blindfolded. Professional rescuers would have bandaged the eyes of a person trapped in the dark for five weeks before taking him into daylight, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. But it said rescue authorities in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> could not confirm <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON>'s story, leaving disturbing questions. `` Why, for instance, a day after the miraculous salvation, was it possible to locate only <PERSON> Aikaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> in a <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> hospital?'' the news agency asked. `` Where is the survivor's sister, who failed to appear at the hospital on Friday, though she promised to do so?'' In an intriguing twist, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted an acquaintance of <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> named <PERSON> Siranush </PERSON> <PERSON> Nersesyan </PERSON>, who said she heard in the housing administration in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> on Jan. 9 _ two days before <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> says he was rescued _ that people probably were still alive in the basement of that building. In its story Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> recalled a report earlier this month on <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> TV that 17 earthquake victims had survived for weeks in a wrecked bakery by eating grain and melted snow. That report was subsequently denied by rescue officials. `` A host of other news items from <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, truthful and invented, sell on the world news market.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It is understandable: One wants so much to believe in the miracle of six people being saved on the 35th day after the quake.''

<HEAD>Two Journalists Lied On Applications, Got Jobs At Heathrow</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two British journalists said Friday they got jobs as airplane cleaners at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> using fake applications and were able to wander on and off jets where they could easily have planted bombs. One of them, a <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekend </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> researcher, said he left a package on a <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight without being challenged. The other, <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudman </PERSON>, said he was hired by <ORGANIZATION> Skyliner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> after a 10-minute interview and found `` alarming holes'' in <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> security three weeks after a bomb was planted on Pan Am Flight 103. The two journalists were not working together when they got their airport jobs. The British Airports Authority, which operates <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>, refused comment. <PERSON> Dudman </PERSON> said he decided to apply at the airport after a bomb blew up Flight 103 on Dec. 21, killing all 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground in the Scottish town of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. The New York-bound flight originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and switched to a bigger plane at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dudman </PERSON> said he was hired by <ORGANIZATION> Skyliner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, a private cleaning contractor, after an interview Jan. 4. He said his application, which contained many lies, was never checked. <PERSON> Dudman </PERSON> said he received a pass that allowed him access to all areas of the airport, and he started work Jan. 9. `` As a part-time aircraft cleaner, it enabled me to board 12 jetliners on any one of which I could have planted a bomb under a seat or in a locker,'' he said. `` I gained unchallenged access to luggage containers and the cabin and flight decks of trans-Atlantic airlines where at times I was alone and unsupervised,'' he said. <PERSON> Dudman </PERSON> said he carried bulky packages and a camera past security posts and was never stopped or questioned, even when he took photographs on the airfield. Several photographs appeared in the paper, including one that showed the reporter posing near some Pan Am luggage. `` Each member of the cleaming staff I spoke to about security said they had never seen any and expressed amazement there had been no clampdown after <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Dudman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekend </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> said researcher <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was hired by <PERSON> Fernley </PERSON> <PERSON> Aeroclean </PERSON>, using a fake name. It said he planted a parcel on <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 402. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said he was n't searched when boarding planes or supervised while working and could have planted the parcel anywhere, except possibly <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> which ran a metal detector over the cabin after the cleaners had finished. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekend </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, said after he received a call from <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, he bought a ticket on Flight 402, retrieved the package from under a window seat during the flight and took it into the cockpit without challenge. `` It could have contained a bomb, a gun or a knife,'' he said. `` I could easily have blown up or hijacked the plane.'' <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekend </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> said the incident was filmed and would be shown Sunday, subject to approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. After <PERSON> Dudman </PERSON>'s disclosure, <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>'s managing director, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON>, announced that <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> had withdrawn security passes for staff at Skyliner. Transport Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> to tighten security to ensure no one had unsupervised access to aircraft or checked baggage in restricted areas unless they had held an airport pass for at least six months. Skyliner called the government's action `` a very harsh decision because procedures for security are the same with us as they are for all the other companies at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Landlord Who Refused to Rent to Unwed Couple Challenges State Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARSHALL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man being sued by the state for refusing to rent to an unmarried couple is challenging the state Human Rights Act, which he says violates his religious beliefs forbidding sex before marriage. `` The Bible clearly states this is wrong,'' Layle French, 32, said Thursday from his farm outside <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, in southwestern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. `` I live with the Bible as my guide.'' French said the Human Rights Act, which protects Minnesotans from various forms of discrimination, violates his First Amendment right to freedom of religion and is unconstitutional. The dispute began last February when <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> of <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> sought to rent a house owned by French. <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> and French entered into an agreement in which <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> told French she intended to live with her fiance and that his two children would stay with thempart of every month, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> complaint. Two days later, French told <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> he had changed his mind and would not rent to her. French said he told her, `` Why do n't you get married and I'll let you rent it.'' He and his attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, filed a written response Friday with the state attorney general's office to the lawsuit filed Dec. 7 by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. An administrative law judge is scheduled to hear the case April 11. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the law's lack of a provision for a jury trial makes it unconstitutional. Human Rights Commissioner <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said juries do not hear human rights cases because juries are supposed to reflect the society's majority, and human rights laws are designed to protect the minority. He said French was trying to control the lives of his tenants. `` Landlords often have exaggerated ideas of what their rights are,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. `` They're trying to invent a constitutional right to say, ` I have the right to tell you what to think.''' French said he believes by living together the couple would violate a little-known state statute that outlaws sexual intercourse between unmarried adults. `` We contend it's a very schizophrenic state that on the one hand outlaws fornication and on the other compels cohabitation,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` It's against his religious convictions to rent on that basis.'' He conceded that the misdemeanor sex statute was rarely enforced although still on the books. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said French had no evidence <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> and her fiance would violate the law forbidding sex before marriage. Phone calls to <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>' home for comment Friday went unanswered.

<HEAD>Official Says Lost Missile Part Would Be Valuable To Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A flight data recorder missing from a 1987 long-range nuclear missile test would provide valuable information to any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adversary that might have recovered the device, an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday. Although the recorder contained no classified information, `` it is valuable,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON>, a department spokeswoman. She declined to describe the specific value of the recorder to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or any other country. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged earlier this week it was investigating the loss of the recorder and said there was a possibility it may have been found by the Soviets. Defense officials also said the recording device, which would contain such information as the acceleration and velocity of the missile during flight, was not classified. But a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> source indicated the data would be valuable to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adversary since the missile was being tested under realistic conditions. `` Would n't you like to get your hands on that?'' asked the source. <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON> said a search for the device was continuing jointly by the departments of defense and energy but there was no clear evidence it had fallen into Soviet hands. The Energy Department is responsible for building and testing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear warheads. During test flights the missiles carry a dummy warhead and not an actual nuclear weapon, although the rest of the missile contents are real. Ms. <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON> said only the flight date recorder and `` some minor debris'' were lost during the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recovery of the Minuteman 2 missile that was launched July 7, 1987 from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> toward <ORGANIZATION> Kwajalein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atoll </ORGANIZATION> in the western <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. She said this was the first time that a missile's flight data recorder had been lost in a test flight. `` It does n't pose a loss of any technology for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but obviously there are a lot of things unclassified that we do n't want non-allied countries to have,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON> said

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> will meet with cabinet members from six major allies to prepare for a major gathering on Third World debt, West German Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said Friday. The `` Group of Seven'' includes <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Their ministers of finance and the heads of their central banks meet at irregular intervals to try and bring their economic policies closer together and coordinate policy on the dollar and other currencies. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, said no decision has been made on the meeting. Support for it has now also been voiced by <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, the British chancellor of the exchequer, who saw <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> earlier this week. The presidents of seven major Latin American debtor countries will be meeting in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> Feb. 2 at the inauguration of <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> as president of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and the recently inaugurated President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> have taken the lead in urging relief from the debt burden that has resulted in net payments of $ 20 to $ 30 billion a year from poor countries to richer ones. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, one of the most regular with its payments, at length joined many of the other debtor governments and suspended payments of principal on most of its $ 30.3 billion debt on Dec. 31. There have been reports that <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> is considering a stop on interest as well. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who will be inaugurated next week as vice-president, will represent the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the inauguration. Latin American countries owe more than $ 440 billion of the $ 1.3 trillion of Third World debt. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> are the biggest Third World debtors, with much of the money owed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks.

<HEAD>Malpractice Settlements Reach $5.3 Million In Bone Peg Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four medical malpractice suits against a doctor who replaced patients' spinal discs with bone taken from cadavers have been settled for $ 5.3 million, said lawyers for the plaintiffs. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, an orthopedic surgeon, used a garden hose to wash the bone pegs cut from pelvic bones of cadavers at the <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> morgue, after getting permission from next of kin, lawyers said. He then stored the bone pegs in his kitchen freezer, they said. Three other malpractice suits against <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> are pending. The latest settlement of $ 975,000 was reached Tuesday, 90 minutes into the testimony from the first witness during the trial of a suit brought by <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>. Her lawyers said she suffered crippling pain and a severe loss of mobility because of the procedure. `` Nobody that I know uses this procedure,'' testified Dr. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, an orthopedic surgeon from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>'s medical school. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>'s insurer, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Patients Compensation Fund, agreed to settle while <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> was testifying. In earlier court proceedings, <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> denied he committed malpractice, but he declined to comment after the settlement. The procedure is not experimental but is considered difficult and requires extensive training, said <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, who represented Mrs. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> performed the operation 107 times on 58 people, and his own records showed a success rate of 24 percent, said another lawyer for Mrs. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianchi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> told Mrs. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, who injured her back in a 1981 fall, that replacing a disc with a bone peg had a 90 percent chance of alleviating her pain, according to court papers. Mrs. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s pain, however, worsened after the operation at <LOCATION> Humana-Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Community </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, and she sustained nerve injury, the suit said. She underwent two more operations, one using more bone pegs from a cadaver and the other using bone chisled from Mrs. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s hip. In the end, she had 14 different bone pegs hammered in and nine chisled out, the suit said. The hospital also was named in the suit but was dropped from the case Monday after agreeing to a small settlement, that was not disclosed. Prior settlements reached in the last six months have ranged from $ 247,500 to $ 2,062,000. Three more cases are set for trial later this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulation </ORGANIZATION> has no public record of any investigation or discipline involving <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a spokesman said.

<HEAD>Sources Say DOE Put Accelerator Report `On Ice''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Department of Energy held back for several months a report that concluded there was a cheaper, quicker and safer way to produce tritium for nuclear weapons than building a new production reactor, sources familiar with the report said Friday. A copy of a draft summary of the report obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said a linear accelerator could produce enough tritium to meet all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons needs. The report, which still has not been released, was prepared by scientists at the department's <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION> national laboratories and the <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse-Hanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a department contractor based at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. The draft summary was dated August 1988, a month after the department had recommended construction of two new production reactors and at a time when there was deepening concern about the safety and reliability of the entire weapons complex, particularly the tritium-producing reactors at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The sources, who asked not to be identified, said Friday that department officials were worried that release of the report would provide further ammunition for critics of the department's decision to build new reactors. They also said officials feared the report could cause problems at a time when the department was struggling to get its defense production programs back on track. The sources said the department wanted the report held until after the election and the new administration took office. `` I think the words were ` put it on ice,''' said one source at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> reservation familiar with the report. `` They wanted to hide it under a rug.'' Another source, who worked on the report, said that as word of the study started to seep out to the scientific community, there were subtle suggestions to scientists at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> that they not discuss it. The source also said the report had yet to receive a fair hearing from the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and that those who have seen it at the department have been skeptical about its conclusions. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON>, a department spokeswoman, denied that the department had been holding the report. `` We've not directed any such effort to put such a report on hold,'' she said. `` To my knowledge the department has not formally reviewed and therefore is not prepared to discuss this particular proposal. `` I would point out that pursuance of other technologies to meet long-term national security requirements is consistent with the objectives of our national laboratories and contractors.'' Ms. <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON> had said earlier that the department's <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> looked briefly at the idea of using an accelerator to produce tritium, but concluded that the technology was not `` mature enough to provide new production capacity.'' An accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic particles are whipped at high speed until they crash into a target, in this case lithium clad in aluminum. The resulting collision produces tritium, a radioactive gas used in nuclear warheads. The draft report said that an accelerator would produce far less radioactive waste, would not operate at the high pressures and extreme temperatures and `` should be more acceptable to the public'' than a nuclear reactor.

 Mayor <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> on Friday announced her candidacy for a second term as the leader of the nation's seventh-largest city, a day after a mayoral commission released its plan to stem racial tensions `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> is on the move again,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, 64, the city's first elected woman mayor. `` We've regained the momentum of the'60s,'70s and early'80s.'' The mayor said she has worked hard to promote the city as a good place to do business. `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> is the best place anywhere for businesses to succeed,'' she said, but conceded that <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> has been losing tax base to its suburbs. `` At the top of my list of priorities are fighting crime and drugs and economic development, which I believe are inextricably tied together.'' The second year of her first two-year term as mayor was one of the most violent in the city's history. Five <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officers were killed and the city recorded a record number of homicides. She said progress has been made toward easing racial tensions and praised the work of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Together, a 76-member commission she appointed to study race relations in the wake of the police shootings and a dispute over the role of the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The commission issued a report Thursday that recommended the appointment of a charter review committee to study the number and composition of city council districts. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is now comprised of the mayor, two at-large members and eight district members. Expensive campaigns keep many people from running for city office, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Together said. Mrs. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> spent about $ 1.2 million on her mayoral race in 1987, but she said she would not spend that much for the May 6 election. She is the only announced candidate for the post. Mrs. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> served two terms as an at-large City Council member and defeated <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> in a runoff for mayor in 1987. The incumbent, <PERSON> Starke </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, did not run. A public relations consultant, Mrs. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> has been active in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> civic and performing arts organizations for more than 20 years.

<TEXT>
 The government on Friday applauded a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> report calling this country's leading anti-apartheid group a terrorist organization. But the government also said it was confused by a report released by another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agency with a contradictory view. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report, released Wednesday, listed the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> among 52 terrorist organizations worldwide. `` As far as the South African government is concerned, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> report correctly analyzes terrorism,'' said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. However, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> released a statement from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that contradicted the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> report. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has not determined that the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is a terrorist organization,'' said the statement prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. The State Department supported the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s aims of ending apartheid and establishing a democracy, but it disagreed with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s use of violence, the statement said. Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> described the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement as `` somewhat confusing.'' He added, `` Nevertheless, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> acknowledges that the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s -LRB- violent -RRB- methods are unacceptable, and this is the decisive issue.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said its booklet, which included a foreword by President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, was prepared as a reference work _ not as a policy statement. The booklet has prompted headlines in South African newspapers and angry condemnations of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by some anti-apartheid activists and organizations. Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize laureate who says he supports the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' goals but opposes violence, said he was `` shocked and dismayed'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the group was included in the book because authorities wanted to warn Americans of the danger from the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and other organizations around the world. The spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kudla </PERSON>, said the book had been `` fully coordinated'' with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. But within the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, counterterrorism officials disagreed with professional diplomats, who wrote the statement contradicting the the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> report and who are concerned with maintaining ties to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s black majority. The South African government banned the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1960, and the group began a sabotage campaign one year later. There have been 180 bombings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> during the 31-month state of emergency, killing 35 people and injuring at least 665 of all races. The government says it will not negotiate with the group unless it renounces violence. The congress says it had no alternative but to take up arms after it was banned as a peaceful organization.

 Eight leaders of <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>'s government resigned Friday, two days after the central republic's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders were forced out by growing unrest over the region's faltering It was the first time the entire government and party leaderships of one of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six constituent republics had stepped down. The Montenegrin <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Friday accepted the resignations of the six-man state presidency but voted to keep it in a caretaker capacity until new elections were held. It also accepted resignations of the republic's representative in the collective nine-man federal presidency and of its speaker, <PERSON> Velisav </PERSON> <PERSON> Vuksanovic </PERSON>. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported later that the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> also decided to call early elections in <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>. A final decision on that matter will be made Jan. 26, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. On Wednesday, the party's central committee formally accepted the resignation of its ruling Politburo and named a interim leadership to prepare for an extraordinary party congress. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s federal government, six republic governments and two autonomous provinces each are run by a party presidium, a state presidency and a government. The presidencies, headed by chairmen, mostly have formal functions subordinate to the party. <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>'s government, in charge of implementing economic policies, already resigned after mass protests last October. The ouster of the entire <LOCATION> Montenegrin </LOCATION> ruling elite came after more than 120,000 people demonstrated earlier this week in <LOCATION> Titograd </LOCATION>, the region's capital, demanding the leadership step down because of the disastrous state of the region's economy. `` The current mass dissatisfaction among the workers, students and young people is due to a large extent to the difficulties faced by the country as a whole,'' said <PERSON> Bozidar </PERSON> <PERSON> Tadic </PERSON>, vice-president of the <ORGANIZATION> Montenegrin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, in his keynote speech which was broadcast live on national television. <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>'s representative on the federal presidency, <PERSON> Veselin </PERSON> <PERSON> Djuranovic </PERSON>, said his decision to step down `` was motivated by a sense of responsibility for the economic situation ... and in the expectation that it will help alleviate the crisis.'' <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s smallest republic and one of its poorest, has been particularly hard hit by the protracted national economic crisis, characterized by a 250 percent inflation rate, a $ 21 billion foreign debt and 12 percent drop in living standards in 1988 alone. The average monthly salary in the republic amounts to the equivalent of $ 80, and unemployment has soared after the closing of several unprofitable enterprises previously subsidized through federal funds.

 Diplomats from the tiny African nation of <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> collected more parking tickets per car than any other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission in the city where the world body makes its home. Data released Friday by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> show the five cars of the East African nation's mission received 307 summonses in the first six months of 1988. The bureau said each car collected an average of 10.2 tickets a month. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seychelles </LOCATION> rounded out the list of the top five parking scofflaws, according to bureau figures. Each of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s five cars was ticketed an average of 8.47 times per month, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s three vehicles each got 7.83 tickets a month, the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>'s 13 vehicles each got 6.96 tickets, and <LOCATION> Seychelles </LOCATION> with one car collected six. Figures for the last half of 1988 are not yet available. Consular and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomats hold diplomatic immunity and thus can not be compelled to pay parking tickets. Few ever do, and the <ORGANIZATION> Parking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> does not try to collect the millions in unpaid fines. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> parking tickets cost $ 10 to $ 40, depending on the offense. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, with 110 vehicles, did not even make the list of the top 20 offenders. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mission does not issue diplomatic plates to its employees, and did not appear on the list. The <ORGANIZATION> Parking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> turns its list over to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Commission for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, which serves as liaison between the city and the foreign diplomatic community. Officials in that commission, headed by <PERSON> Gillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON>, talk to the worst offenders and have achieved some success in reducing the number of offenses. The total number of parking tickets went down from 153,784 in 1978 to fewer than 65,000 in 1985, even though assigned diplomatic parking spaces in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> were cut by 40 percent, according to Mrs. <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON>'s office.

<TEXT>
 Ask <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> McAnally </PERSON> what he thinks of the people he portrays so memorably, and the Irish actor is lost for words. His job, he says, is to honor his characters, not to judge them. `` The character is me; I see the world that he sees,'' says the 62-year-old actor, who can be seen on Masterpiece Theater on PBS on Sunday playing fictional Prime Minister <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, a socialist who is unseated by his own uppercrust secret service. Written by <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Plater </PERSON> and directed by <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, it will air in two parts _ Sunday from 9 to 10 p.m. EST and Monday, 9 to 11 p.m. EST. It's <PERSON> McAnally </PERSON>'s second recent PBS series, following his starring role as ne'er - do-well <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pym </PERSON> in <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Carre </PERSON>'s `` A Perfect Spy Set in 1990s <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, `` Coup'' shares the paranoiac, conspiratorial tone of such recent British films and TV series as `` Defense of the Realm'' and `` Edge of Darkness.'' It is rooted in a long-standing, real-life conspiracy theory _ that right-wingers in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> secret service plotted to oust <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government in the'70s. Adapted from a novel by <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON>, a Labor lawmaker, `` Coup'' is a satire in which a Labor prime minister outrages his opponents by telling the truth to the press and honoring his election pledges. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>' downfall comes from keeping a promise to remove <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases, and turning to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for aid rather than allowing <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to remain `` an aircraft carrier for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' As the right-wing press howls for his blood, the secret service sets out to discredit him by concocting a phony bank account in his name and digging up an ancient love affair. The series invites debate, but <PERSON> McAnally </PERSON> keeps his distance. An Irish resident who has never voted in a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> election, he tries to get under <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>' skin without evaluating him. `` My job is not to make decisions about politics -LRB- but -RRB- to create the human being,'' <PERSON> McAnally </PERSON> said in a phone interview. `` If I were playing -LRB- British Prime Minister -RRB- <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, I'd vote for <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. `` When I play <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, I'm in his shoes. He feels that the world needs changing, that the values society holds need to be changed.'' <PERSON> McAnally </PERSON>'s strength is his uncanny ability to become his character, whether as the polished papal ambassador in `` The Mission,'' or as the roughhewn Ulster work boss in `` Cal.'' The Perkins role required a distinctly south <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> accent which he honed to perfection by spending five months in the pubs and steel foundries of <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>. Of scripts, he says: `` I draw no massive, cosmic, global conclusions, but simply take every line in detail.'' <PERSON> McAnally </PERSON> has rarely been out of work since making his professional debut in his native <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Donegal </LOCATION> at age 16. He has worked closely over five decades with <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s Abbey Theater in more than 150 plays, classic and modern, as both an actor and a director. Movie work has ranged from `` Shake Hands With the Devil'' with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cagney </PERSON> to `` The Fourth Protocol'' with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON>. He most recently appeared on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s West End stage last season playing <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> alongside Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON> in `` The Best of Friends.'' <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Joffe </PERSON>'s movie `` The Mission'' made him a star, a status he accepts with ambivalence: `` I'm still, thank God, quite anonymous.'' Married with four children, <PERSON> McAnally </PERSON> says he was first drawn to acting at age 6, and sees it as `` a vocation, not a career.'' `` This is where I belong,'' he said. `` A lot of people go into the business because they think it's going to give them something. That, I think, can be disastrous because they may not get what they're looking for.'' <PERSON> McAnally </PERSON> will be seen later this year as the lawyer <PERSON> Jaggers </PERSON> in a new TV adaptation of `` Great Expectations.''

The maneuvers, code-named National Week, are being held in international waters and air space, said Lt. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Kempisty </PERSON>. `` National Week is a routine, previously scheduled exercise that has been held once or twice a year since 1967,'' he said. The maneuvers began Wednesday, a week after <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> jets shot down two Libyan warplanes over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Treiki </PERSON>, has called the operations a provocation. Tensions were high even before the jet downing, as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> raised the possibility of a military strike against an alleged chemical weapons factory near <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. Defense officials said the exercises were taking place well away from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had canceled a missile-firing exercise in the central Mediterranean north of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kempisty </PERSON> said the exercises are to end Tuesday. He said the maneuvers are designed to `` train the incoming carrier battle group in <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> operations.'' He provided no other details. A 13-ship battle group headed by the aircraft carrier <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> sailed into the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> early Wednesday, joining the carrier <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> and its support ships.

<HEAD>State Board of Education Adopts Evolution Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG WILLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> on Friday unanimously adopted a new policy statement intended to strengthen the teaching of evolution in the state's 7,125 public schools. Fundamentalist church leaders criticized the new policy, which was adopted as a guideline for classroom teachers and for textbook publishers, and said they will urge local school boards throughout the state to interpret the policy to allow teachers or students to question evolution. A key provision of the policy statement specifies that only theories based on factual evidence should be taught in science classes, while theories based on religious belief `` are appropriate to the History-Social Science and English-Language Arts curricula.'' Associate State Superindentent <PERSON> Francie </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> described adoption of the new policy statement as `` a very significant step'' toward eliminating the hesitancy of some local schools to teach evolution in science classes when faced with opposition from church leaders. `` It makes it explicit what is science and what is religion. That means evolution is going to be taught as the main theory of origins. We have not had anything of this clarity before,'' she told reporters after the board's vote. But the Rev. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Traditional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Values </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which he said includes 6,000 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> churches, said the principal weakness of the new policy is that it is not clear how students or teachers may question evolution theory. `` Is there still a door of opportunity through which a critical view of evolution can be raised? We do not see it precisely in the language. We're kind of in a no man's land,'' he told reporters after the vote. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> said his group is n't advocating the teaching of the Bible creation theory in science classes, but only wants to `` keep the door open'' to allow discussion of other theories of the the origin of life. `` The issue is, will evolution be taught as fact, or as theory,'' <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> said, adding that there `` is some positive material in the statement. We just want to carry it further.'' Neither side testified directly before the full board, which adopted the policy statement after a brief description and no debate. But nearly half of the board's members had participated in part or all of two lengthy hearings drafting the statement earlier this month. The debate over the policy statement focused almost exclusively on evolution, but that word did n't even appear in the first two drafts of the document, and was added in the final draft adopted by the board only as an example of scientific theories in a footnote. However, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said she was sure that to textbook publishers and local teachers, `` it's very, very clear'' that the statement sets policy for teaching evolution.

 Airport authorities said former Ugandan dictator <PERSON> Idi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION> on Friday apparently bound for <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION>, the Zairean capital, from which he was just deported. The authorities said on condition of anonymity that <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> flew out on the same Falcon 50 plane that brought him to the Senegalese capital on Thursday. It belongs to the Zairean state mining company <ORGANIZATION> Gecamines </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>, accompanied by one of his sons, was detained in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION> on Jan. 3 as he tried to enter <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> on a false passport, one of a batch reported stolen. Zairean officials said they established that <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> intended to return to <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. The two countries share a common border. Officials in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION> made it clear <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>'s presence was unwelcome and an embarrassment. They assured neighboring countries of continuing cooperation and good will. Calling himself `` Dada'' -LRB- Big Daddy -RRB-, the 300-pound <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> seized power in a 1971 coup and ruled until 1979, drawing world accusations of human rights atrocities and corruption. <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>'s president now is <PERSON> Yoweri </PERSON> <PERSON> Museveni </PERSON>. <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> was supposed to take a flight from <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, where he has been living in exile for years, but the plane left for <LOCATION> Jidda </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> capital, without him, the authorities said. They said the pilot would not accept him as a passenger because he did not have a Saudi visa. They said when the Falcon 50 left they presumed it was returning to <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION>. Elaborate security precautions at the airport prevented reporters from talking to <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>. Saudi diplomats said authorities in <LOCATION> Jidda </LOCATION> were not pleased at the manner he left the country and are not happy about accepting him back.

<TEXT>
 Alongside the icy runway at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s airport, about 500 Soviet soldiers laden with equipment lined up Friday in front of giant transport planes waiting to take them back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> Downtown, Afghans huddled in blankets against the biting cold, forming long lines for bread or gasoline. Bread, the staple diet of the poor, has become a precious and increasingly expensive commodity. Afghan guerrillas, assisted by a bitter winter, appear to be making an increasingly effective attempt to blockade the city of 3 million, and some diplomats say the Soviet strategy is to get out as quickly as possible, with as little publicity as possible. Indeed, Friday's troop departure was the latest in what Western diplomats say is a rapidly accelerating pullout that belies hints from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> it may not meet next month's withdrawal deadline. `` They -LRB- the Soviet troops -RRB- are leaving and they want to cover up the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> end of it,'' said one Western diplomat. `` It could be that with the acute shortages, they do n't want to show the unpleasant reality of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>.'' But the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Friday: `` An extremely difficult situation developed in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in providing the population with foodstuffs. Long breadlines appeared in the city.'' It reported that the government imposed an anti-hoarding decree under which `` people who deliberately hide surplus foodstuffs and do not hand them over in time, are brought to court.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said convoys of food, fuel and other necessities were being rushed into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, but `` groups of extremists attack convoys virtually every day and are a constant threat to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s supplies.'' Afghan government forces killed or wounded 100 insurgents in battles in <LOCATION> Nangarhar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> provinces, and near <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> seized 54 missiles intended for use against the capital city, the news agency said. Another 170 resistance fighters were killed or wounded in fighting among rival factions, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Under a U.N.-mandated agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, is to be out of the country by Feb. 15. Soldiers began leaving May 15, and about half the estimated 100,000 were gone by Aug. 15. But the Moslem guerrillas fighting the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> and Afghan troops this week broke off negotiations with <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, the Soviet deputy foreign minister and the ambassador to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> hinted that if the insurgency continued, the Soviet troops might delay their departure. Western diplomats say the current rate of withdrawal indicates the bulk of the Soviet troops are likely to be gone ahead of schedule. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Friday. The nature of his visit was not disclosed by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. Friday's group of troops was lined up beside two blue and white Ilyushin-76 transport planes. More than a dozen smaller Antonov aircraft were nearby. Diplomats estimate that seven to eight Il-76 aircraft arrive and leave daily. This week, the Soviets shut down their 700-bed military hospital in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, pulled out all the medical staff and handed the facility over to the Afghan administration. Soviet civilian advisers as well as government ministers are also going. There are no firm numbers on how many of the estimated 2,500 advisers remain. Diplomats say that in the past week, the number of advisers at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> has been cut from 16 to two and at the <ORGANIZATION> Afghan-Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> from 20 to five. The price of nan, the flat bread that along with sugar and tea is all most Afghans can reguarly afford, has more than doubled to about 15 Afghanis. At the commonly used black market rate, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar is worth 200 Afghanis. Sugar ran out at most stores about a month ago. On Sunday, a regular working day in this Moslem country, the bread shortage was so acute that 80 percent of bread stores were closed. Witnesses said a group of Afghan soldiers broke into and robbed one store that still had supplies. Large parts of the city are without power for up to six hours daily. In what appears to be part of an effort to conserve power, the university closed in November, a month early, and wo n't reopen until March, a month late. Thos who can afford it are exacerbating the shortages by stocking up. People join cars at gas stations, filling up two-gallon cans to lug home. One Western diplomat estimated that up to 7,000 of the remaining 50,000 Soviet soldiers may have left since the new year. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Jan. 11 that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had renewed its withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Army Gen. <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shabanov </PERSON>, a deputy Soviet defense minister, told a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> news conference Friday: `` It is our intention to abide by the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements. This is our duty and indeed this is the firm opinion and strong intention of our leaders. So there can be no doubts in this regard.''

<HEAD>Treasury Considering Merger of Bank and S&amp;L Agencies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is working on a savings and loan reform plan that would transfer control of the insurance fund for <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L deposits from its current regulatory parent to the agency that insures commercial banks, a government official said Friday. However, the department has n't decided for certain on the recommendation to President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, which would give the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> jurisdiction over the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. It would be an administrative merger, not a merger of the money in the funds, which are each separately financed through premiums paid by the industry they insure, the official said. Commercial bankers are lobbying hard to make sure money from their fund does n't go to solve a competing industry's problems. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> is solvent, with more than $ 15 billion in reserves. The <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, although it still has several billion dollars in cash to work with, has been technically insolvent since 1986. An administrative merger of the funds would promote similar regulatory standards for both banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls. Bankers believe that regulation of S & amp; Ls is now more lax. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> already regulates institutions, called savings banks, which are similar to savings and loan associations. Even so, many in the S & amp; L industry believe merging the funds would eventually mean the end of a separate system of providing home mortgage loans. Currently, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> runs the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, which as the deposit insuror has prime responsibility for making sure <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls engage in safe lending practices. However, the bank board is also charged with promoting home ownership by establishing S & amp; Ls, a role critics say can inherently conflict with the FSLICs. The Wall Street Journal, in Friday's editions, cited sources who said the department is close to deciding in favor of the FSLIC-FDIC merger, but is still considering whether to recommend abolishing the bank board altogether. S & amp; L regulators reacted strongly against both proposals, which could be forwarded to President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as soon as he takes office on Jan. 20. `` I think it's a crummy idea,'' said bank board member <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. `` It does not get us any kind of pot of gold that's going to solve the problem. I do n't think you get any better regulation. ... What it does do is create administrative disruption and disarray at exactly the wrong time.'' <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, has in several speeches expressed his agency's preference `` for going it alone,'' however, he has said he would, if asked, tackle the job of regulating S & amp; Ls in addition to banks. In a study released earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> recommended that <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> be made independent of the bank board, but remain separate from the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>. Treasury is also examining ways to find a source of money to devote to faster rescues and closings of insolvent S & amp; Ls. Proposals range from a mechanism to borrow the money `` off-budget'' so that it does not inflate the budget deficit to spending the money outright, but declaring it exempt from Gramm-Rudman deficit limits. A senior member of both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gradison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, suggested Friday a rationale for exempting <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L rescue spending from Gramm-Rudman. <PERSON> Gradison </PERSON> released a <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> report that argued that the economic impact of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L failures has already been felt because the losses already exist as a liability of the government, regardless of when the payoff actually occurs. `` The bailout should be reflected in the budget, but because the economic impact has already been absorbed, the resulting outlays should be exempt from the Gramm-Rudman targets,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s outgoing budget director, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, told reporters Friday he favored putting the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L rescue `` on-budget,'' rather than hiding the spending through some budgetary device. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, moved this week to establish an independent source of expertise on S & amp; Ls in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by naming <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> business professor, as chief domestic policy adviser, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney, as an assistant for issues analysis.

 <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, who shot four young black men on the subway and was convicted only of illegal gun possession, was sentenced Friday to one year in jail and fined $ 5,000 after a judge noted he had shown no remorse. `` I do feel this case is really more about the deterioration of society than it is about me,'' <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> told the court before the sentence was pronounced. `` Society needs to be protected from criminals.'' <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s lack of remorse `` gave me concern he might recidivate in possessing a firearm,'' said state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state's trial-level court. The now-famous defendant, who faced one to seven years, decided to go ahead with his sentencing even though he has asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to review his case because he wants to get the jail time over with, said his attorney, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. `` He's resigned to the fact that he's going to jail,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` He's paid his bills for the next few months and gotten his affairs in order. He's tense and apprehensive.'' Under a one-year prison sentence, <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> gets credit for nine days he already served immediately after his arrest, and becomes eligible for parole in 51 days. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> left immediately for <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> city jail, smiling meekly at court officers as he was led away. The <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agreed to a defense request that <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> be kept in protective custody there, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` There is no rhyme, reason or reality to <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> going to jail,'' <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s other attorney, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Slotnick </PERSON>, said after the sentencing. He had urged that his client's sentence be limited to the nine days he had already served. `` He has lived in a fishbowl -LRB- due to publicity -RRB- and he should not go to jail,'' <PERSON> Slotnick </PERSON> told the judge. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Waples </PERSON>, calling <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> `` a potential danger to himself and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> society,'' sought a one-year sentence with supervised parole so that <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> would be forced to undergo psychiatric treatment. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> shot the teen-agers in December 1984. He fled to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, then surrendered, saying he had shot the men because he felt he was about to be robbed. The case became a sensation of the talk-show airwaves and editorial pages, prompting debates on racism, self-defense and vigilantism. To many blacks in particular, <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> was a cold-hearted criminal, a symbol of racially-motivated violence; to many whites, particularly gun owners, he was the `` subway vigilante,'' an ordinary citizen protecting his rights. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> was acquitted in June 1987 of attempted murder, assault and other charges and convicted only of possessing the gun used at the time. On Oct. 19, 1987, <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> to six months in jail, a $ 5,000 fine, 200 hours community service, five years' probation and psychiatric counseling. But last year, a mid-level appeals court overturned the sentence, saying the judge should have followed the state gun control law, which mandated a one-year sentence. The case was returned to Crane for resentencing. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Slotnick </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 6 to review the case because they are challenging the conviction itself. But because <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> wants to get the jail time over with, the attorneys did not request that the sentencing be held off until the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rules within six to eight weeks, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` We all decided to proceed and not delay it any further,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` If he gets the straight time -LRB- of a year in jail -RRB-, we wo n't appeal that'' either If the high court decides to review the case, however, the attorneys would ask that <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s sentence be interrupted, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Three of the four teen-agers <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> shot recovered. The fourth was brain-damaged and partially paralyzed. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> claimed he shot them in self-defense because he was about to be robbed; the youths claimed they were panhandling. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s sentence is `` an outrage and gives license to bigots and lunatics all over the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to go out and blast people who they hate and fear,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON>, a lawyer representing one of the teen-agers, <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabey </PERSON>, in a multimillion-dollar suit against <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>. He said he had spoken with <PERSON> Cabey </PERSON>'s mother, who expressed disappointment with the verdict. `` She was hoping a stiff sentence would prevent other people from going out and doing to black youth what <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> did to <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabey </PERSON>. Unfortunately, that's not going to happen.'' Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said he thought the sentence was appropriate, saying of those who carry illegal handguns, `` Every one of them should serve a year in jail. No exceptions.'' Despite all the headlines and public debate that the <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> case spawned, it is difficult to say if the case changed the lives of anyone not directly involved in the shooting or its prosecution. In the place it logically would have had the greatest impact _ the subways _ police say they can see little effect. `` I do n't really see any pattern at all that exists based on that particular case,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON>, a spokesman for the transit police. Subway crime figures have bounced up and down in the years since the shooting, while subway ridership has been up. An estimated 3 -LCB- million people use the subway every weekday. `` The perception of subway crime, of being frightened, is more than the reality,'' said <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON>. `` We're trying to address that and inform the public.''

 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> arrived in the capital on Friday, the Afghan news agency said, and more fighting was reported between government and rebel forces. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet news agency, also said the government has reopened a main supply line to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> that had been cut by heavy snow and resistance attacks. The break in the supply line had created long bread lines. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s trip, reported in a one-sentence statement by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, had not been announced previously. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> gave no indication of his itinerary. `` Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on a working visit today,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> dispatch said. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> reported his arrival. The trip came after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Jan. 11 that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had renewed its withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Under agreements signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> withdrew half of its 100,000 soldiers between May 15 and Aug. 15 and the remainder are to leave by Feb. 15. But Soviet officials have accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of violating those agreements by continuing to provide military aid to the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> resistance, and have raised the possibility that the withdrawal will not be completed on time. Army Gen. <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shabanov </PERSON>, a deputy Soviet defense minister, told a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> news conference on Friday: `` It is our intention to abide by the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements.

Asked to comment on the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that the second stage of the withdrawal had begun, he said, `` The first stage of the withdrawal is over and I am sure the second stage will begin soon.'' <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, first deputy foreign minister and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, has urged the formation of a broad-based government including representatives of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> pro-Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. But the resistance refused to continue talks with the Soviets, saying <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> was trying to secure a place for its ally in any post-war government. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that a car bomb exploded in the Afghan city of <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION>, killing or wounding 20 people. In another report, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said a main supply route to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> from the northern village of <LOCATION> Hayraton </LOCATION>, closed by heavy snow and rebel attacks, had been reopened. `` An extremely difficult situation developed in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in providing the population with foodstuffs. Long breadlines appeared in the city,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It reported that the government imposed an anti-hoarding decree under which `` people who deliberately hide surplus foodstuffs and do not hand them over in time, are brought to court.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said convoys of food, fuel and other necessities were being rushed into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, but `` groups of extremists attack convoys virtually every day and are a constant threat to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s supplies.'' Afghan government forces killed or wounded 100 insurgents in battles in <LOCATION> Nangarhar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> provinces, and near <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> seized 54 missiles intended for use against the capital city, it said. Another 170 resistance fighters were killed or wounded in fighting among rival factions, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to replace a faltering Marxist regime with a new government and stayed behind to fight an anti-communist insurgency. They agreed to withdraw under a U.N.-brokered accord reached last year.

<HEAD>Official Uses Private Firm for News Release</HEAD>

 A departing <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official used a private public relations firm Friday to announce a press conference that was not officially cleared with the attorney general. The public relations company that issued the release for Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marzulla </PERSON> had recently prepared an announcement that the outgoing head of the land and natural resources division was joining a local law firm to start an environmental-law practice. Without telling the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s public affairs staff, <PERSON> Hartz </PERSON> @ <ORGANIZATION> Meek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, told news organizations the land division planned to file a court action against the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s sewage treatment plant. Department spokesman <PERSON> Loye </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said use of a private public relations firm to announce an official <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> action was unprecedented and ran counter to established procedures. The firm got involved in official <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> business just four days after the agency announced deep cuts in its public affairs staff that would take effect in 30 days. Later Friday, <PERSON> Marzulla </PERSON> appeared before television cameras in his office to discuss the court action even though department officials said he had not received clearance to hold a press conference. At the outset, <PERSON> Marzulla </PERSON> said he was conducting a briefing, not a press conference. But he read a prepared statement and took questions during a session filmed by two local TV camera crews. The Hartz @ Meek press release was distributed before the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued its formal release announcing the government was seeking a $ 3.1 million contempt-of-court judgment against the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> government for failing to upgrade the sewage plant. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said he was unaware of the private company's news release. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said he had been unable to get clearance from the attorney general's staff for <PERSON> Marzulla </PERSON> to hold a press conference. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marzulla </PERSON> had sought clearance from Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s office to hold a press conference. The spokesman said he was prepared to advise <PERSON> Marzulla </PERSON> not to hold a press conference when he was told the assistant attorney general had withdrawn his request for clearance. <PERSON> Marzulla </PERSON> said he asked <PERSON> Hartz </PERSON> @ Meek to issue the release to give local news organizations notice that the department's action was being taken. More publicity is needed, <PERSON> Marzulla </PERSON> said because the department's anti-pollution efforts have been `` eclipsed by the wrong notion that there has not been enough enforcement. He denied seeking to promote his new career as an environmental lawyer by using the public relations firm to summon local reporters to the briefing. `` It does not strike me as inappropriate,'' <PERSON> Marzulla </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact and 12 other European nations on Friday informally accepted a landmark human rights and security accord designed to enhance freedom in the Soviet bloc and boost East-West contacts. But a lingering dispute between <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> continued to block final agreement on a mandate for new East-West arms talks. The accord includes provisions that would increase religious freedom; speed emigration procedures and the issuance of visas for important family reasons; allow independent monitoring; encourage tourism; allow freer spread of information; and give all prisoners humane treatment. Another provision would stop the abuse of psychiatry against political prisoners. Soviet authorities have been accused of using mental hospitals to punish dissidents. Western diplomats hailed the document as a major advance on human rights, but noted the key test was whether the Soviet bloc would stick to it. The 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act, signed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and all European nations bar <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, contained commitments to free travel, information and other human rights that the East bloc often violated. The <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> document `` refined and defined the humanitarian undertakings in far greater detail than ever possible before,'' noted Canadian Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, who played a prominent part in Western efforts to achieve good human rights agreements. Reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> played a major role in securing the agreement, <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> and other Western diplomats said. Diplomats trying to resolve the dispute between <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies, reported no firm progress Friday, and scheduled their next session of <ORGANIZATION> NATO-Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> Pact talks for Saturday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the talks, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON>, said Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will not come to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> next week to wind up the 35-nation <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> review conference and formally approve the final document unless the dispute is solved. `` <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> could decide at any moment that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> could wait no longer,'' <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> told reporters. `` Time is running out.'' <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> are arguing over whether to include a strategic triangle of Turkish territory close to the Syrian border and the disputed port of <LOCATION> Mersin </LOCATION> in new East-West talks on reducing conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> will have to share the bame if their dispute unravels the arms talks and <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> conference agreements. Polish Ambassador <PERSON> Wlodzimierz </PERSON> <PERSON> Konarski </PERSON>, speaking on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>, said late Friday, `` We have done all we can'' to reach agreement in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. `` The problem remaining ... is not East-West,'' he said. `` You ca n't blame the East for it.'' <PERSON> Konarski </PERSON> said the session set for Saturday was `` the final deadline'' for advising foreign ministers whether or not to come to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> next week. The ministers are scheduled to end the meeting in a three-day session next week. The meeting opened in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in November 1986. The mandate for the new arms talks is supposed to be included in the final document of the conference. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact gave provisional agreement to the final document _ minus the mandate for arms talks _ on Friday after the 12 neutral and non-aligned nations at the conference worked late into the night to resolve outstanding differences. Even as the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc informally accepted the accords, reports came from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> of the arrest of at least seven independent human rights activists in that nation. Communist authorities in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> also have banned a rally planned Sunday by independent groups in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> who want to commemorate a student who burned himself to death in January 1969 to protest the 1968 Soviet-led invasion. If finally approved, the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> accord contains provisions to: _ Allow religious education, the spread of religious literature and charity action by churches. _ Resolve outstanding emigration applications within six months, and grant visas for family reunification within one to three months. _ Facilitate tourism, allowing Western visitors to stay in East bloc homes. _ Provide much more information needed by Western businessmen trading in the East. _ Allow independent groups to monitor their governments' human rights behavior, and the state of the environment. In addition, the agreement provides for the first time a formal mechanism allowing any <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> signatory to take up human rights matters with any other signatory. Annual conferences on human rights are planned before the next <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> review conference, scheduled in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> in 1992.

<HEAD>Dukakis Begins Aggressive Campaign to Promote $735 Million Tax Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A day after announcing a $ 735 million tax package, Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> launched a campaign Friday to build political support for the plan, which has drawn little enthusiasm in the Legislature. The governor's first stop on what aides said would be an aggressive, highly visible statewide lobbying effort was <ORGANIZATION> Bunker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, the kind of government investment <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says his tax plan is designed to protect. `` For our children and our grandchildren's sakes _ 180,000 of who attend our public colleges and universities _ we must go forward,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, calling education the key to good jobs. `` That's why I need your support for the revenue package I unveiled last night.'' His plan, which seeks to raise $ 131 million in the next six months and $ 604 million in the following year, targets drinkers, smokers, drivers, investors, corporations and utilities. The governor said he was committed to building support for new taxes rather than pare government spending much further. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> committees Friday that he is withholding $ 250 million in spending authorized in the $ 11.6 billion budget because the state does not have the money to pay for the spending. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told legislators that his <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> met Thursday and made no change in its forecast of state tax collections. At its last meeting in December, the board trimmed $ 308 million from its projection for the current fiscal year, which ends on June 30. In addition to meeting with hundreds of students and university officials at the <LOCATION> Bunker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> campus, the governor also spent much of the day giving interviews to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> television stations to promote the program. The biggest element in the package was a proposed doubling in the personal income tax rate on profits from capital gains on investments. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> proposed keeping the current exemption for sales of homes and would exempt profits from new investments in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also proposed raising the gasoline tax from 11 cents to 17 cents a gallon; adding 4 cents per pack to the cigarette excise; a 50 percent increase in the state tax on beer, wine and alcohol; and applying the sales tax to purchases by utilities and to interstate telephone calls and data transmissions. In addition, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called for diverting $ 14 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Unemployment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to a job training program and changing the schedule of filing corporate estimated taxes to bring in an extra $ 46 million this year. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will present the tax proposal in a legislative package to skeptical legislators next week, just past the mid-point in the budget year. He said the plan would have to take effect by April 1 to help balance the budget this year. In December, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> acknowledged a shortfall of at least $ 600 million in the current state budget of $ 11.6 billion.

<HEAD>Navy Withdrawing Another Ship From Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has decided to withdraw another warship from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, citing the continuing cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The USS <PERSON> Josephus </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, a guided missle cruiser, was ordered out of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> Friday, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The spokesman said the move was approved by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. He acted after a month's experience with new convoy monitoring procedures inside the gulf, <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>' departure leaves 14 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships still operating inside the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and another 10 deployed with an aircraft carrier battle group nearby in the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The 14 still inside the gulf include six warships, six minesweepers, one amphibious landing ship and one flag ship. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has very gradually reduced its naval task force inside the gulf since <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed to a truce last August in their seven-year war. Last month, with the cease fire still holding, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships relaxed their convoy procedures for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag tankers to a system of very loose radio and radar monitoring. Before the cease fire, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had been accompanying the merchant ships on each transit of the gulf to provide maximum protection.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will try to enter a civil suit brought against the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> over admissions that it failed to test components in engines sold to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, officials announced Friday. A former plant manager for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Divincenzo </PERSON>, sued <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> last September under a law which lets private citizens seek damages on behalf of the government for alleged fraudulent activity. The assistant attorney general for civil proceedings, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>, said in a statement the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was petitioning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> to join the suit, but it was not known when <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> would decide the issue. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> investigators have been reviewing GE admissions that test records may have been falsified at a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> factory that made parts for military and commercial aircraft, according to court documents and federal officials. The investigation centers on a check and drain valve for the F-404 engine that powers the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s F @ A-18 fighter, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announcement. The GE factory in question also makes an engine part used by the type of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> aircraft that crashed Sunday in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, killing 44 people. However, federal and company officials said the part could not have caused the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> accident. The federal investigation began last year and has no connection with the accident in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said Wednesday the factory made a timer valve for the CFM56 engine used by the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 as well as a check and drain valve for the F404 engine aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s FA-18 fighter Another GE employee, attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, said in a letter dated last June 2 that test records may have been falsified for valves used on the FA-18 in 1984-87. According to newly revealed court papers in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has become involved in the investigation of the FA-18 engines. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Lt. <PERSON> Nettie </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was unable to say immediately whether the F @ A-18 had experienced problems from faulty check and drain valves. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the GE attorney, said in his letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> that: `` In late May 1988, it was discovered that prior to July 1987, a particular flow leak check, which is required by <ORGANIZATION> GEAE </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engine </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- specifications, was not performed on the F-404 check and drain valves.'' `` It is believed that the test was discontinued sometime in 1983, possibly as a result of the test fixture becoming broken,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said in the letter. `` The test was reinstituted in July 1987 when the problem was detected by lower level personnel in the plant,'' the letter said. `` During the period involved, it is also believed that operators may have falsified internal test records which are maintained to reflect actual test readings.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s letter does not indicate the total number of engines or their value, but said the deliveries covered the periods of April-May 1984, April-May 1985, April-May 1986, and April-May 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said they had received <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s letter as part of what they called a `` voluntary disclosure program'' for companies that believe they have not met the terms of their contracts The inspector general's office in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, in conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, is investigating the admissions in the letter, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. At the request of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, all documents in the <PERSON> Divincenzo </PERSON> suit remained under seal until last Friday, when Judge <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> denied a federal motion to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> until Feb. 1 to decide whether to join the case as a plaintiff.

 Arabs rioted in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> on Friday after Jewish settlers began an armed patrol, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Israeli soldiers reportedly killed two Palestinians and wounded 18 in separate clashes. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, assailants believed to be Jewish militants smashed a monument to fallen Arab soldiers. Israeli soldiers killed a 15-year-old Palestinian during a clash at the Dheishe refugee camp near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, doctors said. They said a bullet hit <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Laban </PERSON> in the shoulder and then pierced his heart. An Arab reporter said the youth was shot when dozens of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths hurled stones at troops, who responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and, finally, live ammunition. He died at a <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> hospital. The army said it was checking the report. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio confirmed the death and said another youth was wounded in the clash. Earlier Friday, a 15-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> died of wounds sustained in a clash with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops a day before, officials at <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> said. They said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalhoub </PERSON> was shot in the head during a confrontation in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. An army spokesman confirmed the death and said the boy was shot when troops who pursued stone-throwers found themselves in a dangerous situation. The spokesman, who can not be identified under military rules, did not elaborate. The deaths raised to at least 353 the number of Palestinians killed since the uprising against Israeli rule was launched in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in December 1987. Fifteen Israelis have been killed. Armed Jewish settlers patrolled the streets of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, claiming they wanted to prevent stone-throwing attacks on their cars, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. Arab youths hurled rocks at the patrol, and the settlers opened fire in the air, the radio and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The action sparked a riot by Arabs in the city's casbah, a maze of narrow streets serving as an open-air market, they said. An Arab reporter in the city said dozens of youths who left the main Ibrahim Mosque began throwing stones at soldiers, who opened fire with live ammunition, wounding a 20-year-old in the stomach and a 22-year-old in the leg. The army spokesman confirmed the injuries but said he was unaware of the settlers' patrol. In east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, assailants partially smashed a stone monument to soldiers of the Arab Legion near the Rockefeller Museum, police spokesman <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapidot </PERSON> said. He said police had no suspects. The Arab Legion was the <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> force that tried to prevent the establishment of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1948. An anonymous caller told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio the monument was damaged by `` lovers of the land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Jewish people.'' He said the attack was to protest the dismantling by troops two days ago of a monument erected by Jewish settlers in honor of an Israeli taxi driver slain in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Settlers have vowed to erect additional monuments to Jews killed in the occupied lands in defiance of an army ban. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> condemned the desecration of the monument. `` Several idiots came from some place in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to damage the monument,'' <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> said. `` This is stupidity and idiocy in addition to evil.'' <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> expressed concern the incident may spark retaliation by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> militants and further fuel tensions in the disputed city. He said the municipality will offer money to Arab authorities for repairing the monument. New confrontations were reported in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Hospital officials said at least seven Palestinian were wounded in clashes at the Jabalya and Shati refugee camps. In the <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> refugee camp, soldiers shot and wounded three young Palestinians, officials at <ORGANIZATION> Nasser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said. The wounded included an 11-year-old boy shot in the pelvis and a 12-year-old wounded in the leg, they said. Merchants in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> began a commercial strike after pro-PLO leaders of the uprising called for the move in slogans painted on walls. The strike is to protest Israeli raids to collect taxes from Palestinians. Non-payment of taxes is a major tactic of the uprising. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a 17-year-old Palestinian from the village of <LOCATION> Faroun </LOCATION> was hit by a plastic bullet in the leg when soldiers opened fire at masked stone throwers, doctors said. Four others were wounded at the Askar refugee camp.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told Soviet and American high school exchange students Friday that as they get to know one another, they will discover `` that most of the problems in this world between countries do not exist between people.''

 Two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters Friday began a long-distance rescue relay to save 32 people stranded on a stricken Cypriot freighter in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> 400 miles off the southwest coast of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the coast guard said. The 42,000-ton Yarrawonga, bound from <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to pick up a load of iron ore, was caught in gale-force winds and lost 240 square yards of side plating and three hatch covers Friday. `` I do n't know how long we can stay like this,'' the unidentified skipper said in a radio message. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the German and Filipino crew members were not believed to be in immediate danger. But <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Falmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> said, `` The skipper has been reporting more cracks appearing in the hull of his ship.'' The HH-53C helicopters, chosen for their range and 35-man capacity, took off from their base at Woodbridge-Bentwaters 72 miles east of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and flew to <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> airport in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> on Friday night to refuel and await first light, the coast guard said. The aircrafts' 800-mile round trip journey will require in-flight refueling from tanker support aircraft. `` It's a very tricky situation and the rescue should take until midday Saturday,'' said <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>. `` The helicopters will try to winch off the 32 crew, and that will be very tricky, too, but it's something these helicopter crews train for. The helicopters were expected to fly the rescued crew members to <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>. The crippled vessel's skipper reported one woman among the crew _ the wife of an officer. He said three of the 32 aboard were German and the rest Filipino. Two British <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Nimrod reconnaissance planes from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mawgan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cornwall </LOCATION>, southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, reached the bulk carrier before dark on Friday and took pictures showing a gaping hole in its starboard side and three hatches open. Relays of Nimrods, designed for long searching at sea, were circling the ship overnight. The Yarrawonga reported boiler failure earlier in the day but managed repairs and was on the move again Friday afternoon, making about 7 mph toward the west coast of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The ship left port in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> in December and was bound for the St. Lawrence seaway in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Earlier Friday, a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> trawler ran aground in high seas off the southwest coast of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and three of its crew were lost. The Big Cat's skipper, chief engineer and boatswain were presumed drowned after the vessel hit rocks at <LOCATION> Valentia </LOCATION> harbor, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kerry </LOCATION>. A coastal life-saving team rescued 11 crewmen _ nine Spanish and two British. Names and nationalities of the dead and missing were not released.

<TEXT>
 A prosecutor on Friday ordered a criminal inquiry into a West German firm <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says helped build a poison gas factory in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, compounding the embarrassment of the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government. The inquiry into the export activities of Imhausen-Chemie, a <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> chemical firm, was announced eight days after the government said the firm appeared to have no link with the suspected chemical weapons plant. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Botz </PERSON>, chief prosecutor for the <LOCATION> Offenburg </LOCATION> region, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he opened the new investigation after reading an extensive report on the issue in this week's Stern magazine. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is pleased the West Germans `` took a look'' at the evidence supplied by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and investigated the matter. In another embarrassment Friday, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s spokesman conceded at a news conference that intelligence sources told the government in October that West German companies may have helped build the plant south of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, the Libyan capital Government spokesman <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> had said earlier that <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> knew nothing of alleged West German complicity in the project until <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> brought it up during <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in November At the same news conference Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Karl-Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Driesch </PERSON> said investigators had to date found no evidence against West German firms that would stand up in court. After meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Friday with Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> had `` some new information'' to link West German firms with building the Libyan plant. He said, however, that criminal prosecution would proceed only if there was `` complete evidence,'' and pledged that `` whatever it takes to get information, it will be followed.'' West German and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts met for a second day in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to examine <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> evidence on the plant's purpose and alleged West German involvement. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> cited what it said were official documents and witnesses in its article, which accused three firms _ Imhausen-Chemie, the now defunct I.B.I. Engineering of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsao </PERSON> medical supply of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> _ of being deeply involved in the <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> project. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials contend the plant in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, is intended to produce chemical weapons. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says it is a pharmaceutical plant. Stern alleged that Imhausen-Chemie provided `` everything that is needed to build a chemical plant'' to I.B.I., which in turn shipped the materials to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> under forged bills of lading. The article also mentioned involvement by the <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Link </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION> firm of <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. The director of that company, <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Gedopt </PERSON>, was arrested in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> Wednesday night and charged with forging shipping documents on goods delivered to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. A woman who answered the telephone at Imhausen-Chemie Friday said the firm would have no comment on the developments. She refused to give her name or put calls through to the management. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Treiki </PERSON>, has said the West Germans `` did help us, not only in this plant, in other plants also.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> the <LOCATION> Offenburg </LOCATION> prosecutor had informed <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> of his decision to reopen the inquiry into into Imhausen-Chemie. But the official said the decision was not the result of evidence provided by government-ordered audits. `` We have said repeatedly that we have found no grounds for prosecution,'' the official said. `` The prosecutors in our country are free to order investigations independent of the government.'' West German law requires firms exporting hazardous materials, arms or their components to obtain licenses from the <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. However, officials have said the legalities regarding transfer of technology or consultation vary from case to case. The <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Saturday editions that West German intelligence chief <PERSON> Hans-Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Wieck </PERSON> told <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s office in late September it had uncovered indications of West German involvement in the project. Die Welt, which gave no source for the report in editions delivered late Friday, said <PERSON> Imhausen-Chemie </PERSON>'s name was not mentioned to <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> until Oct. 18. `` Were the intelligence warnings ignored?'' Die Welt headlined its front-page article.

 Two Teamsters union officials were convicted Friday of federal charges they participated in a $ 700,000 payroll padding scheme that involved hiring `` ghost employees'' who were paid but did little or no work. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury found <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, 66, a <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> international vice president and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>, guilty on four counts: labor racketeering, conspiracy to commit labor racketeering, embezzlement and filing false reports. He was acquitted of one count of embezzlement and one count of filing false reports. Teamsters Local 507 Recording Secretary <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, 52, was found guilty of all three charges against him: labor racketeering, conspiracy to commit labor racketeering and embezzlement, which could carry penalties of up to 45 years in prison and a fine up of to $ 60,000. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> was accused of being a `` ghost employee,'' an employee paid for doing no work. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> faces a maximum sentence of 46 years in prison and fines up to $ 70,000 on the convictions. No sentencing date has been set. When the verdict was announced, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> looked down and shook his head, but <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> showed no emotion. A couple of women in a crowd of supporters cried, and another ran out of the courtroom sobbing. <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> international president until his death of brain cancer July 9, was indicted with <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> on May 16, 1986, but was never tried. His illness prompted repeated delays in the trial, which started Oct. 24 and heard from 80 witnesses. Court documents have indicated that <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, also secretary-treasurer of Local 507, and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> were <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informants. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s former attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Climaco </PERSON>, has said <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s defense would have been that he was authorized by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to hire `` ghost employees'' to enhance and protect his informant status The prosecution contended that <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> could n't have been authorized to hire `` ghost employees'' because they were on the payroll as early as 1972 and <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> did n't begin informing until 1977. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>'s attorney said <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> was a government informant in 1963. Lawyers for <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> to release documents about <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s work as an informant, but the judge declined, preserving the mystery over who <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> informed on and when. When White declined to release the documents, <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> rested their case without using the defense planned by <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> testified that as far as he knew, the alleged `` ghost employees'' worked for their pay. The jury deliberated Wednesday afternoon and all day Thursday before returning to court Friday, when they asked White if they would be permitted to deliberate on Monday, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Day The judge said no. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, in addition to being one of 16 <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> international vice presidents, is president of <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> 41 in northeast <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and president of both Teamsters Local 507 and Bakery Workers Local 19. The two locals share offices and have a combined membership of about 12,000. A union officer must relinquish his union positions for 13 years if convicted of certain felonies, including embezzlement, a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said. Among the prosecution witnesses were three alleged `` ghost employees'' who testified that they were paid by the union and did little or no work.

<HEAD>Eight Killed When Cable Car Plunges Into Ravine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRENOBLE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Eight technicians trying out an ultra-modern cable car plunged to their deaths Friday in an accident near the ski resort town of l'Alpe d'Huez, local officials said. The victims, all from the region, were employed by a tourist association and the Pomagalsky construction company, based in this mountainous southeastern town. The cable car, which could hold 125 people, unhooked from its overhead line and dropped 660 feet to the bottom of a ravine. There was no immediate explanation why the car became unhooked from the cable, which was intact, the officials said. Although it was difficult to reach the spot, rescue workers found the car quickly, but no one was alive. `` As soon as we got down there, we knew we would n't find any survivors,'' said one fireman from the rescue team. `` They were literally part of the metal and the tubes.'' Nightfall and the other difficulties hampered the salvage operation. The cable service was to be opened on Jan. 21 and was described as one of the longest in world at 1.6 miles. It was the pride of the 450 inhabitants of the tiny hamlet of <LOCATION> Vaujany </LOCATION>, north of l'Alpe d'Huez. It would have been able to bring 2,000 skiers an hour to the village and link it to ski slopes in the 9,200-foot Petites Rousses chain and other resorts.

 A man prosecutors call `` the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'' claimed Friday at a deportation hearing that he was framed for crimes in his homeland and faces certain death from mobsters or corrupt police if he is deported. <PERSON> Carmine </PERSON> <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>, 32, told Immigration Judge <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Zerbe </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> Nuova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camorra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizzata </ORGANIZATION>, a criminal clan similar to the Mafia that operates in and around <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, wanted him to join them but that he rebuffed their overtures. <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> testified that he once was asked to saw off a shotgun for a customer of the auto body shop owned by his father in <LOCATION> Acerra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. When he refused, the customer _ who allegedly controlled the local police force _ had him harassed by police and eventually framed, <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> said. `` That's why I escaped from my country, because this happens every day,'' said <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>. If he is forced to return to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, he added, `` they kill me.'' Italian authorities charge that he ordered or committed 12 killings in his homeland from April 1982 through June 1983. <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> has not been convicted of those crimes. An attempt to have him extradited last year failed because the charges on which the extradition warrant was based were dropped. <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>, wearing handcuffs, testified for an hour Friday in a small federal hearing room guarded by a sentry with a shotgun. <PERSON> Zerbe </PERSON> said he would issue a written opinion in the case next week. The judge ruled earlier Friday that <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> can not be deported on the basis of weapons convictions in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, because the convictions occurred after he was living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>, who moved here in April 1984, still could be deported because he entered the country on a fraudulent passport, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>, a government attorney. Italian courts convicted <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> of associating with criminals and of forging license plates for cars engaged in criminal activity, in addition to the weapons violations. The murder charges have not gone to trial, and warrants that were issued for them have expired, though the charges still stand, <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> was arrested almost two years ago and has been incarcerated ever since in solitary confinement at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center. A federal prosecutor at time of the arrest called <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> the `` <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> denied the accusation. `` Would the ` <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>' come to Chic-13 ui AM-Germany-Libya, 1st Ld-Wri a0777 0259 19:56 01-13 uv BC-ACC -- Access Menu Advisory a0778 0848 19:58 01-13 ua AM-Bush, Bjt, 1st Ld-Writeth a0779 0593 19:59 01-13ni. `` Get out of the way, I do n't want to run you over,'' he joked with the handful of reporters. `` You know I'm not a good driver.'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> was sparring for the first time since Saturday, when he went six rounds with two opponents. orthern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> High temperatures were forecast in the 20s over the northern Intermountain region, the northern and central Rockies, much of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and from northeast <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> across <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> to western upper <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>; in t 3 percent.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Friday night he hopes the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will overturn the landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion so `` the voice of life'' could be heard `` over all the others.'' Appearing at the annual dinner of the Knights of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, a Roman Catholic civic organization that helps the poor, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urged church people to join forces in fighting for the rights of the unborn. `` Our critics call themselves pro-choice, but have they ever stopped to think that the unborn never have a choice?'' he said. Referring to the 1973 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision legalizing abortion, the president said, `` When <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> versus <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> goes _ as I have faith it must _ the way of Dred <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> and ` separate but equal,' a new debate will rise in the state houses of our land.'' `` And the voice that I believe must be heard, and in the end shall be heard over all the others, is the voice of l ife,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` The Knights can be part of that voice,'' he said. In an excerpt of an interview that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave to Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, for broadcast on <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s Sunday television show here, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked about criticism that he shown little sensitivity to the care of children after they're born. `` Well, some of the people have said that are the same ones who, for example in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, have supported a bill with regard to child care, that the goverment would require a grandmother to be licensed in order to be given the care of her own grandchild,'' he replied. `` This is just ridiculous.'' The president replied by repeating his criticism of the proposed Act for Better Child Care, circulating in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that the bill would require a grandmother to be licensed to care for her grand child. It was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s last official out-of-town business trip. The president and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, will travel to Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, Saturday, and the pair will remain at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> next week until <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> attends President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inauguration on Friday. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that while he may be leaving office, he `` wo n't leave the battle.'' `` In just seven days, I will lay down the mantle of this great office the American people have bestowed upon me,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` I wo n't leave the battle. As long as there is breath in me, I will fight for the principles in which I believe.'' `` But if I may, in this moment of leaving office make two special requests of you. The first is that you prepare now to be part of that voice of life in the great debate ahead. And the second, that you help <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> find a way out of the trap of the welfare state. Help it find a way to open the doors of hope and love, open them as no state, any state, ever can, for those in need. Help open the promises of this land of shining opportunity to all,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was presented with the organization's highest honor _ the Grand Cross of Merit Special Class _ `` for his vigorous defense of the pro-life cause and his strong support of traditional Christian family values.''. The Knights of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> order is a worldwide philanthropic organization which seeks to serve `` the least of thy brethren.'' The organization is comprised of 10,000 members in 40 countries and is headquartered in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, an American linked to an illegal arms-supply network aiding the Nicaraguan rebels, was being held Friday under charges of drug trafficking and violating Costa Rican national security, his lawyer said. Attorney <PERSON> Ciro </PERSON> <PERSON> Casas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> was formally charged in the 4th <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and was being held in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sebastian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, where he will remain until a Monday bail hearing. A source in the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION> said on condition of anonymity that <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> was arrested Thursday for investigation into charges of drug and weapons trafficking and spying for the U.S.-backed Contras fighting the Nicaraguan government. The Office of Judicial Investigations acted after residents near his farm on the Nicaraguan border denounced activities by <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> that were seen as possibly endangering relations between <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government, the source said. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s lawyer called his client's arrest `` politically motivated'' and said he plans to appeal. `` This is a simple case of political persecution in which the government of President -LRB- Oscar -RRB- <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> is trying to defend the political interests of the Sandinista government and the Costa Rican Marxists,'' <PERSON> Casas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> said. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy official said on condition of anonymity that an American consular official was seeking permission to visit <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>. The official dismissed suggestions that the arrest was politically motivated, contending that the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION> has an honorable reputation. All the embassy can do, the official said, is ensure <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> has access to a lawyer and that he is treated the same as a Costa Rican citizen. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> resident who is about 69 years old, has lived in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> for 20 years and has said he is a Costa Rican citizen. He has acknowledged he supported the Contras and has said that in the past he let them use his property in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chiles </LOCATION>, 81 miles northwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Messing </PERSON>, who heads the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he and Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreier </PERSON>, R-Calif., met with <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> during a fact-finding trip to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> last month He said <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> assured them he stopped assisting the Contras when the Iran-Contra case broke. In the case, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials sent arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for money to be sent to the Contras. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> said in 1986 interviews that authorities twice raided his home looking for evidence of rumored gun running and drug smuggling. The searches turned up nothing, he said. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Mariella </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Patoka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, confirmed that her husband was being held, the <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION> -LRB- Ind. -RRB- Courier reported Friday. Mrs. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> would not reveal details about the case, but said she was informed by telephone that her husband was arrested, the newspaper said.

 Twenty-six teen-agers moved into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> consulate Friday for a weekend anti-apartheid protest to mark the birthday of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The students, none of them black and ranging in age from 13 to 19, occupied a hallway outside the consulate's third-floor office, singing songs such as `` We Shall Overcome'' and other protest anthems. The crowd blocked at least one person from entering. The group brought sleeping bags, food and satchels of books. They said they would camp in the hallway until Monday, when fellow protesters planned a march at the building to commemorate the birthday of the slain American civil rights leader and to denounce <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of racial segregation. `` We're doing it for the kids of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where they can be detained and tortured even without their parents' knowing it,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, 14, a student at 32nd Street School. `` We want to disrupt their business because they make money here and that's more money for the racist South African government,'' said <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Slutsky </PERSON>, 16, a junior at <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. More than 20 uniformed police officers stood by, along with plainclothes officers and fire inspectors, who warned the students against blocking exits.

 A 22-year-old Sikh became the first refugee deported under <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s tough new immigration policies Friday and left <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Wearing a beige trenchcoat, Chhinder Pal was escorted to a boarding gate at a <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> airport after an appeals court ruled he could not stay here while his lawyers appeal his deportation order. The three-judge panel said Pal did not face `` irreparable damage'' if returned to his native <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Pal said he was a Sikh. Violence arising from a Sikh separatist movement has left thousands dead in northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. `` We do n't know if -LRB- Pal -RRB- was in trouble with his government for his political opinions or for activities that by our standards are illegal or revolutionary activities,'' said Judge <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> MacGuigan </PERSON>. Controversial amendments to the Immigration Act were announced last month by Immigration Minister <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> McDougall </PERSON>. They are aimed at stemming the tide of bogus refugees into <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and clearing up a backlog of 85,000 refugee claimants over the next two years. Pal arrived on Jan. 1, the day the new immigration policies went into effect. He appeared before an immigration panel on Jan. 6 claiming his life would be in danger if he were sent back to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. His lawyer, <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weigel </PERSON>, argued that Pal did not have a lawyer present when he gave a statement to immigration officials on arriving in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. That statement was later used against Pal at his hearing. Under the new immigration system, two-member federal panels evaluate a claimant's story and determine whether he faces danger in the country he has left. If both panel members agree a claimant is a bogus refugee, they can order the person deported within 72 hours. In <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, the London-based human rights organization <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> released a statement saying Pal should have passed the first refugee test and been allowed to stay in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> while his claim was being processed. `` -LRB- Pal -RRB- faces the risk of persecution of the basis of his political activities if he is deported to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>,'' said lawyer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schelew </PERSON>, head of the refugee committee of <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION>'s English-Canadian section

<TEXT>
 About 1,000 members of an anti-abortion group defied a federal judge's order Friday and twice blocked the entrance to a Planned Parenthood clinic. Demonstrators from Operation Rescue gathered at about 7:15 a.m. in front of Planned Parenthood's <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON> <PERSON> Center </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, snarling morning rush-hour traffic. A few abortion rights demonstrators also showed up. The clinic was not able to open until 10:15 a.m. because the demonstrators blocked the building's entrance, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman said. Police moved in to make some arrests and protesters who were not arrested left the scene en masse. But they returned several hours later and lay down, blocking the clinic's front door. Police moved in again. A total of 176 people were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. They refused to give their names and were held for arraignment, said Officer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Feeney </PERSON>, a police spokesman. Group spokesman <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said more protests were planned for Saturday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> on Tuesday issued a permanent injunction against the Binghamton-based group, forbidding members to obstruct access to health clinics in the area or harass clients trying to get inside. The order calls for a fine of $ 25,000 a day for violations. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order against the group in May and ordered organizers to tell police where they would be demonstrating so police could place officers at the site. When they failed to do so, the judge fined the group $ 50,000 for violating his order and $ 19,000 to pay police overtime. The group did not inform police of their protest site Friday, so officers in buses followed demonstrators to their destination. The action against the group was brought by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> and other abortion rights groups. The judge ordered that the $ 50,000 fine be donated to NOW and the other groups. Operation Rescue spokesman <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> said Thursday that the group was being discriminated against because of politically unpopular views. It has not paid any fines yet.

 The estimated 10,000 pit bulls in the city could slowly disapppear if the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> succeeds in requiring the terriers be registered, photographed and tattooed. The proposed Health Code amendment, which could be in effect by March, would require photographs, identifying tattoos, mandatory registration and proof that the animal had been spayed or neutered. The proposed regulations also call for owners to be at least 18 years old and that they carry $ 100,000 in liability insurance. The rules would eventually ban all pit bulls from the city after those who are registered die or are moved out. `` If a pup was born after the registration period, that pup would have to be taken out of the city or disposed of,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, the city's health commissioner. Pit bulls were cited in 422 bite cases involving humans between November 1987 and September, said <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davison </PERSON>. That's about 14 percent of the 3,057 bite cases reported in that period, he said.

 Leftist guerrillas battling the U.S.-backed government vowed on Friday to increase attacks in this capital city and advised civilians to stay clear of possible military targets. The rebels, broadcasting on the clandestine Radio <PERSON> Farabundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>, told street vendors and passers-by to avoid the capital's military bases and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> The guerrillas consider <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the sponsor of what they call the counterinsurgency campaign against them. A 9-year-old civil war has killed an estimated 65,000 people, most of them civilians. Urban commandos of the Marxist-led <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> increased actions last year, bringing what had been a primarily rural war to the capital. In November and December, they attacked three major armed forces installations in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, causing about 40 casualties among military personnel. Two civilians were killed and about 40 wounded in the attacks, which employed vehicles equipped with explosive charges. The government considers such attacks terrorist acts. But the rebels say the vehicles serve as `` mobile artillery'' _ launching platforms for rudimentary mortars. They say the explosion in the car is a charge that catapults the bomb toward the military target. The explosion of the launching charge destroys the vehicle and creates a shock wave that shatters surrounding windows and in some cases has killed and wounded passers-by. Also Friday, authorities of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said they have received death threats, and blamed a new death squad that announced its formation last month. Bombs exploded Thursday night at the homes of the dean and assistant dean of the university's humanities college. The bombs damaged property but caused no injuries. University rector <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Argueta </PERSON> <PERSON> Antillon </PERSON>, in a press conference, blamed an anti-communist terror group for placing the bombs and the death threats. Rightists consider the university a haven for leftist revolutionaries.

 The secretary-general of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday denied government charges that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> is financing a Sunday protest march. Official Sandinista government news media have `` mounted a smear campaign against the opposition because they lack the ideological bases to face it,'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Guevara </PERSON> said. `` The Sandinistas use these methods to try and cloud their administrative and political collapse,'' he said. The pro-government newspapers <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> and Barricada, among other <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> media, said opposition political leaders received huge sums of money, including $ 25,000 from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, to pay for the Sunday protest.

 A man accused of killing his wife and burying her body under concrete in the newspaper building where they worked was found guilty of murder Friday. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinks </PERSON>, 40, was convicted after more than eight hours of jury deliberation. He was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison and fined him $ 15,000. Sinks was charged with murder in the death of his wife, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>, 44, whose body was found in a concrete-encased pit at the <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, where she was a clerical worker and he was a building superintendent. Her body was unearthed in April by police acting on an anonymous tip more than five months after Sinks reported her missing. The body was found in a seventh-floor utility room, an area that Sinks supervised, in a small pit used as an overflow reservoir for the heating and cooling system. Prosecutor <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> told the jury that Sinks had an explosive temper and wanted out of his marriage, so he strangled his wife, put her body in a 55-gallon drum, took the drum to the utility room and buried her. `` He put her where nobody, nobody would ever know it,'' <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> said. Prosecutors also cited the testimony of a jail worker who testified that <PERSON> Sinks </PERSON> told him last August he had done something `` in a fit of anger'' that he could not undo and that he had decided to plead innocent by reason o insanity. Defense attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said prosecutors had failed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and attacked the credibility of an anonymous source who led police to the utility room pit. `` They do n't know who he is, where he is or what he is,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. `` There's a Mr. X out there someplace that knows a lot about this.'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said Sinks could have fled if he had been guilty, but did not do so.

Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was convicted of theft and conspiracy and Marks was convicted of conspiracy. Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumgarner </PERSON> will sentence them Feb. 24. Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> claimed she had the power to remove a curse placed on Mrs. <PERSON> Dunton </PERSON> and her family 44 years earlier by her first husband's former girlfriend, Mrs. <PERSON> Dunton </PERSON> testified during the bizarre, three-day trial Mrs. <PERSON> Dunton </PERSON> said she turned over thousands of dollars in cash at a time, supplied Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> with new clothes and gave her a crystal chandelier, according to testimony. Mrs. <PERSON> Dunton </PERSON> also bought a new <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION>, which Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said she needed to store the evil that she had exorcised from Mrs. <PERSON> Dunton </PERSON>, according to testimony. The car eventually was transferred to Marks, Mrs. <PERSON> Dunton </PERSON> said. Not until last January, after a three-month investigation by <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> police, did Mrs. <PERSON> Dunton </PERSON> realize she was duped, she said. Last Feb. 8, police arrested Marks at the couple's <LOCATION> Galesburg </LOCATION> home. Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was stopped in western <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> several days later with a bag filled with about $ 150,000 in jewelry. Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and Marks each posted bonds of up to $ 60,000 to remain free pending trial in Mrs. <PERSON> Dunton </PERSON>'s case. After a pre-trial hearing in April, Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> fled the courthouse moments before police were to arrest her on charges that she stole from three other women. Marks also fled the area at the same time, police said. Police said authorities across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> have been alerted to search for Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, her daughter, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Corricelli </PERSON>, 25, and Marks. Ms. <PERSON> Corricelli </PERSON> also faces a theft charge in the <PERSON> Dunton </PERSON> case and several more in unrelated cases, but she not been arrested.

He said he's been offered $ 20,000, but wants more. `` It'll climb,'' he said, adding that he is seeking $ 50,000 <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said he has only worn the diamond-and-ruby ring three or four times and only displays it upon request. He claimed he's kept in a safe for the past few years. `` It's just a ring,'' he said. `` When I got it, it was good to have, but there's more to life than a gold band and a diamond ... You need to have enough money to have shelter, a car to drive, food to eat.'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, who now spends much of his time at two local places of worship, said the sale would also help him spread his `` ministry.'' `` To me, -LRB- the ring -RRB- is an earthly crown; I'm shooting for the heavenly crown,'' he said. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said he ran the ad to see what kind of response he would get, and left open the possibility that he may not sell it. `` It's not guaranteed I'll sell the ring,'' he said. `` I might not and I might. But if I do sell it to someone, I'd sell it to someone who'll keep it, not bust it up.''

 A substance dentists have long used to strengthen teeth is a key part of a new treatment that appears to safely curb spinal osteoporosis, a progressive bone disorder afflicting some 5 million Americans, researchers say. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> researchers on Thursday announced results from a seven-year trial of the new treatment. Doctors say spinal osteoporosis results from a gradual loss of trabecular bone, found primarily in the spine. It most commonly affects elderly women and results in shortened stature, curvature of the back and a protruding abdomen that can cause back pain and digestive discomfort. The treatment employs a slow-release form of sodium fluoride, a compound used by dentists to strenghthen teeth which _ when given with calcium citrate _ can reverse the effects of osteoporosis by adding bone mass, said Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pak </PERSON>, mineral metabolism chief at <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>.

 On a snowy Sunday morning this month, two youths were buying drugs within a few steps of the Embassy of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. There was nothing furtive about the deal, just money handed over and two small packets given in return. Anybody driving by could have seen it. Across the street, next to the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, a young woman signaled a passing car. The car stopped, the woman leaned into the open window and handed over some money. She withdrew a gloved hand holding a small package. Anybody could have watched. That block, just a mile up 16th Street from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, is one of the estimated 90 open-air drug markets flourishing in the capital, which last year achieved the distinction of having the nation's highest murder rate. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is a city of contrasts, and they never have been more stark. The news coming out of the capital these days _ of farewells and the fresh expectations which arise with the inauguration of a new president _ competes against news of murder, drugs and a mayor under a cloud. Things have gotten bad enough for the other <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to begin to poke into the consciousness of official, prosperous, gleaming <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Barely a block from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, some of the city's homeless huddle on heating grates. Activist <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> estimates there are 15,000 people who live in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with no homes other than the streets, and he says several have frozen to death. The best publicized case was that of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, a World War II veteran who died of exposure across the street from the White House in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. Across the street from the domed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a beggar jangles coins in a tin cup and asks passing legislative aides for money. `` It's the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream and the American nightmare all rolled into one,'' said <PERSON> B.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a drug education counselor with the non-profit <PERSON> Sasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Youthworks </PERSON>, a youth counseling service named in honor of the late daughter of a prominent American diplomat. Statistics provided by the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> highlight the disparity. The <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> has the nation's second highest per capita income after the state of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>: $ 20,303 annually, which is 32.3 percent higher than the national average. The city has the nation's fourth highest per capita education level, with 28 percent of the population having completed 16 years or more of schooling. Yet, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s infant mortality rate is the highest in the country _ 20.8 per 1,000 births, compared to the national average of 10.6, according to the Children's Defense Fund. The city has the country's highest tuberculosis case rate, 25.4 per 100,000, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. `` This city has monoliths of marble attesting to a great civilization, and yet some of its neighborhoods are like the undeveloped Third World,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. Most of the 27 million tourists who come through <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> every year never see the seamier sides. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, most neighborhoods are clearly delineated between the 170,000 white minority and the 458,000 blacks and Hispanics. There are many middle-class black neighorhoods, and integrated neighborhoods, with tidy lawns and substantial houses which could fit anywhere in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Some of the predominantly white areas, such as green and grassy Spring Valley or <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, with shaded streets of elegant Victorian homes, are as comfortable as any in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. One can stroll down <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> _ past the official residence of the vice president, past the statute of <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, past the ornate <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> where Moslems gather to worship, past dozens of elegant embassies _ without a moment's thought of danger In fact, one can live a lifetime in northwest <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> removed from the violence and crime that characterize neighborhoods just a few miles away. `` The lines of race and class are very distinct here,'' said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. `` The neighborhood we live in is completely white and it's a world apart from'' the crime-ridden streets in other parts of the city, said <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinto </PERSON>, a television producer who lives with her husband on a shaded block in northwest <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I feel extremely safe here, we walk around at night with no problems, have barbecues, visit neighbors.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> became a mecca for blacks fleeing the segregationist South in the first half of this century. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was segregated itself until after World War II, but jobs were available for blacks, who ultimately became the majority group in the capital. Most of the people who work in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, whether for the federal government or other employers, live in suburbs across the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> or across the district line in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Among them are black professionals whose income has risen and who chose to migrate away from the city's run-down housing and mediocre schools. `` This meant that many of the role models for black youths are no longer there,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fyfe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, Law and <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The city's youth, who are largely responsible for the sharp escalation in the crime rate, are victims of alienation and hopelessness, said <PERSON> Fyfe </PERSON>. Those feelings, compounded by a 35 percent unemployment rate among the city's youth, have resulted in a sharp escalation of drug consumption and trafficking over the past year. Some of those picked up in police sweeps are as young as 12. `` They see the mansions, the fancy diplomats' cars, and they know they can never have those things,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, himself a former addict and pusher who now works as a researcher for an unusual local television program called `` City Under Siege.'' The nightly 30-minute program, produced with police help, focuses on attempts to stem the drug epidemic. Drugs are responsible for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> surpassing <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s murder rate in 1988, with a record 371 homicides _ 49.42 per 100,000 compared with 48 in the former murder capital. Police say drug-related murders account for 60 percent of the killings, compared to 1986 when they accounted for only one-third. Police officers say many of the killings are the result of turf wars for the lucrative crack trade. Prices of crack _ the highly addictive cocaine-based substance which looks like a rock and is smoked in a pipe _ are much higher in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> than elsewhere, said Lt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Raizilowish </PERSON>. A small bag of crack which goes for $ 50 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> can sell for up to $ 100 here, he said. Young dealers can easily make $ 100 or $ 200 a day. Police are outgunned and outnumbered. A highly touted attack on drug infested neighborhoods called Operation Clean Sweep led to 46,000 arrests over the past two years but has done little more than clog the city's overcrowded jails and court systems. The police chief said it was a failure; it did n't curtail the drug trade for more than a moment. The drug epidemic has undermined the tremendous popularity of D.C. Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, who has been the subject of two investigations into his social ties with suspected drug dealers. City officials say the drug plague can no longer be tolerated. `` We must all make a personal commitment, because we all have a stake in this war against drugs,'' wrote Assistant Police Chief <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulwood </PERSON> in an impassioned <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> article. And he added: `` What happened to our city last year should make us all ashamed.''

 She won an Academy Award for playing the ruthless television executive in `` Network,'' and gave unforgettable performances as <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> in `` <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> and Clyde'' and <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulwray </PERSON> in `` <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON>'s exhaustive preparation and demand for perfection have won her admiration but have also caused tension on the set. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, her co-star in `` <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>,'' nicknamed her `` The Dreaded Dunaway.'' But for her latest movie, `` Burning Secret,'' <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> drops the tempo. She plays <PERSON> Sonya </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuchman </PERSON>, the wife of an American diplomat stationed in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in 1919. The film has a quiet, somber feel and <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> plays her part with the same sense of understatement. `` You just have to keep it balanced inside,'' the actress said. `` It's a part of acting. Your business is the inner character and the rest will take care of itself. `` This particular character was gently restrained. She was very much in the period of 1919, very much as it should be. She was n't like <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> in ` Network.' `` Burning Secret'' also stars <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandauer </PERSON> -LRB- `` Mephisto'' and `` Out of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'' -RRB- as the enigmatic baron who romances <PERSON> Sonya </PERSON>, and features 12-year-old <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Eberts </PERSON> in his film debut as <PERSON> Sonya </PERSON>'s sensitive son `` What <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> does is what the best actors do,'' <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> said. `` He's a link. He always goes against the grain. He's also a very great gentleman.'' <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON>, who has played opposite such seasoned thespians as <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, relished the opportunity to work with an untrained actor such as <PERSON> Eberts </PERSON>. `` Children have a wonderful thing _ they do n't have to battle against artifice,'' <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> is completely genuine, which is what all of us grownups want to achieve. He was n't like a child actor; <PERSON> David </PERSON> did n't have that artifice. He had a wonderful kind of innocence and reality about him.'' Acting Dunaway, noted, is really a way of staying childlike. A chance to remain open and adventurous. `` I do know that acting is play. When you actually are doing it, it's play. Let's do this now and then this. It's all very spontaneous,'' she said. `` That's very enjoyable because the rest of life is far more complicated.'' <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> was born in 1941 in <LOCATION> Bascom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. She attended <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> before transferring to <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> and Applied Arts In 1962, her senior year at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> was chosen to play a lead role in <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s `` The Crucible,'' and was subsequently recommended for admission to an actor's training program at the new Lincoln Center Repertory Theater. Her time at the <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> program led to roles on Broadway in `` A Man for All Seasons'' and `` After the Fall.'' <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON>'s performance as the unhappy wife in the American Place Theater production of `` <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>'s Goat'' caught the attention of talent agent <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Selznick </PERSON> and in 1967 led to her film debut in `` The Happening. Neither that film nor `` Hurry Sundown'' made much of an impact, but later that year <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> earned her first Academy Award nomination when she starred with <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackman </PERSON> in `` <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON>,'' an enormous critical and commercial success. `` I think I've been lucky for many of the roles I've played,'' <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> recalled, `` but <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> was definitely the biggest break for me. It was the closest to me. I felt kind of homefree.'' She went on to earn another Oscar nomination in 1974 for `` <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>'' and was named best actress in 1976 for `` Network.'' Still, fame has had its drawbacks as well: she has divorced twice -LRB- from rock star <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> and photographer <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> -RRB- and her overwrought performance as <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> in the 1981 cult classic, `` Mommie Dearest,'' left moviegoers wondering whether the `` real'' <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> came armed with wire hangers. `` I think it was a mistake to do,'' she admitted. `` The intentions are there, we wanted to make the portrait of a tortured woman. It's an interesting challenge but I do n't think it can be done. People think that you're like that; the persona that's created by the roles you play are identified with you. You have to be careful.'' <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON>'s career made few gains after `` Mommie Dearest'' until 1987, when she won raves as the broken down alcoholic, <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON>, in `` Barfly.'' `` I was absolutely searching for a part that would make people forget ` Mommie Dearest.' ` Barfly' was a gift from <PERSON> Mickie </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Rourke </PERSON>, her co-star -RRB-, a gift from God. I was deglamorized, demystified. `` The vulnerability in ` Barfly' is close to me, but not the drinking.'' <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON>'s admirers have included <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON>, who played her father in `` <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>,'' and <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Winger </PERSON>, who sighted her performance in `` Mommie Dearest'' as a major influence on her own career. <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> expressed great respect for <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> but stressed that her acting style is very much her own. `` You can only be yourself, you ca n't emulate other actresses.''

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s longest running play, the rabbi steals the show. Rabbi <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Levene </PERSON> takes on the roles of an ultra-Orthodox Jew who's never heard of television, a macho bus driver, a Bohemian painter and a character Israelis think of as a typical American tourist: he's crazy about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> but would never want to live here. <PERSON> Levene </PERSON> developed the one-man show as part of the educational program for <ORGANIZATION> Gesher </ORGANIZATION>, Hebrew for bridge, a movement that is trying to bring together religious and secular Israelis at a time when tensions between the two have brought the melting pot society near the boiling point. `` If we do n't understand each other, the rest of the world will just gobble us up,'' <PERSON> Levene </PERSON> recently told 40 secular <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> high school students at a seminar on Jewish identity in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. In recent years, secular Jews, who make up about 70 percent of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 4.2 million population, have clashed in the streets, courts and legislature with observant Orthodox Jews over Sabbath observances and other issues. <PERSON> Levene </PERSON>, a modern Orthodox Jew who grew up in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and moved to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1969, tries to ease tensions by making people laugh at, and appreciate, his parade of stereotypes. In the past decade, he has taken the show to schools, collective farms and army bases, doing as many as four to five shows a week. He also performs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and soon will take the show to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. He began a recent performance as an ultra-Orthodox rabbi, dressed in black and flicking cigarette ashes in his vest pocket when he thinks no one is looking. In an exaggerated show of modesty he covers his eyes when he hears women are in the room. The 41-year-old <PERSON> Levene </PERSON> takes aim at the holier-than-thou tendencies of some ultra-Orthodox. `` A Jewish state? There's a state with a lot of Jews in it, but it's not a Jewish state,'' says his character. `` Everyone here acts just like gentiles.'' As far as he's concerned, prayer is much more effective than any army could be in defending the Jewish people, and things would be better if people rested on the <LOCATION> Sabbath </LOCATION> as the Bible commands. After a short break in his act, <PERSON> Levene </PERSON> returns as <PERSON> Moti </PERSON>, a macho bus driver who wears his army dog tags outside his shirt, which is unbuttoned to his waist. <PERSON> Moti </PERSON> answers most questions in the brusque, clipped style he learned in uniform: `` Affirmative. Ditto.'' His idea of a religious experience is watching a video of the film `` Ben-Hur.'' He's served in every Israeli war since 1948, even if he was just a cook, and he does n't care what his children do when they grow up, so long as they do n't leave <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Levene </PERSON>'s portrayal attacks <PERSON> Moti </PERSON>'s materialism but appreciates his patriotism. While <PERSON> Levene </PERSON> is backstage changing for another character, his straight man, <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Siani </PERSON>, takes over and asks the students for their impressions. The secular teen-agers, many wearing jeans, punk haircuts and oversized earrings, have mixed feelings. `` I like the fact that his family is so important for him, and that charity is a way of life, and mutual help,'' <PERSON> Orna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerzner </PERSON> said of the ultra-Orthodox character. `` I guess in the secular community we've lost that a bit.'' The teen-agers' comments indicate they are much more conservative than the <PERSON> Levene </PERSON> character <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simone </PERSON>, a Paris-born artist who lives in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with his non-Jewish wife and son, <PERSON> Noel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> refused to bear arms in the Israeli military. He is a humanist who believes in justice, world peace and the dignity of man. Most of the students pounced one of the teen-agers in the audience who said he would marry a non-Jew. `` Of course,'' the boy added, defensively, `` only if she agreed to come live here in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with me.'' One of the funniest characters is the cigar-chomping American Jewish fund-raiser. Everybody knows Harry: He has a sun visor on his forehead, a camera around his neck and a bag full of cheap souvenirs, and he's on his 228th visit to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` I know everyone, and everyone knows me,'' he says, adding, `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is real. ... Lets hear it for LA.'' <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> repeatedly mentions that he gave $ 4.5 million to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last year. Although <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> is far from modest and prefers his comfortable American lifestyle to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s hardships, he is a fervent supporter of the state and is involved in his hometown Jewish community. Several high school students said the show made them rethink some of their own stereotyping. `` I do n't believe -LRB- in religion -RRB- at all, and I generally dislike the ultra-Orthodox,'' said <PERSON> Rika </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharir </PERSON>. `` But I think this showed me the more sympathetic side of some religious people.''

<HEAD>Malaria Making Comeback in Venezuela</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY CAPLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Malaria, the killer disease once believed to have been largely eradicated in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, is making a comeback in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. Experts attribute the resurgence to declining standards of living due to scarce resources and a booming population. They estimate that malaria cases in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> reached some 40,000 in 1988, up from 11,127 in 1984, the last year of accurate records kept by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for the country. Recent Venezuelan press accounts have warned of an imminent epidemic of malaria sweeping the remote southeast <LOCATION> Orinoco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> basin </LOCATION>, inhabited mainly by Indians and gold miners. In that area alone at least 50 people have died of the disease in recent months, officials say. Until 1945, malaria was the leading killer in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. It is transmitted by the bite of a female mosquito of the genus anopheles, prevalent in tropical regions. The mosquito bites only between sunset and dawn. The disease is caused by parasites injected during the mosquito's bite The most serious form of malaria causes fever, chills, headache and sometimes shock, kidney and liver failure, and coma. There is no known vaccine against malaria, although researchers are still searching for one. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Montbrun </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s health minister, has made several tours to the malaria-ridden areas and says the nation is facing a severe crisis. He blames the comeback mainly on an influx of gold miners to areas in southeastern <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> that previously were scarcely inhabited. `` Before there was nobody there so we had the disease controlled,'' he said. `` Now with all the people moving in from who knows where, they're getting malaria and there are no controls. `` The gold miners leave holes in the ground that are breeding places for the mosquito. They live in shacks without walls. It is very hard to carry out control programs.'' Dr. <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabaldon </PERSON>, who is credited with largely eradicating the disease in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> by 1961, maintained that the resurgence of the disease resulted because the government halted DDT spraying programs in malaria-prone areas in the last decade and failed to train personnel in control programs. `` They've gotten lazy. The bureacrats would rather sit in their air-conditioned offices than go out in the field and see what is going on under the sun,'' said <PERSON> Gabaldon </PERSON>, who was given the `` Outstanding Alumnus'' award in November by the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hygiene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> for his lifetime fight against malaria. The Venezuelan government, strapped for funds due to falling oil prices and payments of the foreign debt, has cut back on public services. The Health Ministry will run a deficit for 1988 of $ 55 million, said Health Minister <PERSON> Montbrun </PERSON>, meaning that money for DDT spraying and for paying workers in the field has been short. Although banned in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other areas of the world, DDT still is used in tropical regions to fight malaria. Doctors in the field also blame declining government services for the malaria comeback of recent years. A <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> report says DDT spraying campaigns across <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have declined drastically, falling from 13.5 million houses sprayed in 1975 to 5.5 million in 1982. It blames `` recession, economic policies of contraction, and an asymmetrical and non-equitative renegotiation of regional debt'' as causes of a decline in malaria-control programs. Other causes listed in the report are `` massive migrations into the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> basin,'' and `` resistance of vectors, -LRB- anopheles mosquitoes -RRB- to DDT.'' Malaria cases in neighboring <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> have risen from 51,800 in 1970 to 378,257 in 1984, according to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Tourism officials maintain travelers to such popular places as <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s Angel Falls would not be in danger. `` It's not necessary to fear malaria,'' says <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Haua </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Haua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turismo </LOCATION>. `` Perhaps there is a focus in the gold-mining area, but where we go there is no danger. If you want, we can give you a pill here in the office before the trip.'' Doctors say that taking certain quinine-based and other medications during and after trips to malaria-ridden areas can lessen the severity of the disease if it is contracted but not prevent it. Other precautionary measures such as the use of repellents and mosquito-nets at night are usually sufficient, they say.

 During the filming of the classic thriller, `` The Birds,'' <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartwright </PERSON> would take <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> his tea. `` Every afternoon at 4:30,'' said the English-born actress, then a 12-year-old child star. `` He loved the fact that I was from <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, because he used to tell me all the best wine cellars to go to, like it was really going to help me at 12. I wish I could remember some of them now.'' <PERSON> Cartwright </PERSON> got her start in <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyler </PERSON>'s 1962 film `` The Children's Hour.'' Most recently her roles have included `` The Witches of Eastwick,'' `` The Right Stuff'' and `` Alien'' and the critically acclaimed HBO series `` Tanner'88.'' She can be seen Tuesday night in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> movie `` Desperate for Love,'' playing the mother of a teen-ager who is accused of murder. `` That was funny when they sent us the T-shirts,'' she said during lunch at a midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> restaurant. `` It says ` Desperate For Love.' Can you imagine me wearing that down the street here?'' The movie was shot in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and is based on a real-life case from <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cartwright </PERSON> seems surprised when it is suggested that she works a lot. `` I'm glad it seems that way,'' she said. `` Sometimes when I'm off for a month, I start to panic and go, ` Where's my next job? Yeah, I've been really lucky, and the parts that I've gotten have been really different and not really in the same realm which makes it exciting.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, who had directed her in `` Goin' South,'' had suggested her for the role as the small-town prude in `` The Witches of Eastwick,'' a part that had been written with an older actress in mind. Her performance was praised, but she said it set her career back briefly, because casting agents thought she was older than she is, her late 30s. `` I wanted to get out on ` <ORGANIZATION> Bull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Durham </ORGANIZATION>.' I was too old. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON> -RRB- gets it, and she's three years older than I am!'' she said. <PERSON> Cartwright </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON>, was a regular on TV in `` Make Room for Daddy'' and `` Lost in Space.'' <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> lives in <LOCATION> Tolucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and devotes her time to running a gift shop and raising two children, <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>, 7, and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, 3, <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> said. The doting aunt pulled out pictures of the kids. She said her sister works on occasion, if it's convenient and does n't take her away from her family. `` Maybe she got saturated when she was a kid, I do n't know,'' <PERSON> Cartwright </PERSON> said. `` She was on series for 12 years. No, I'm the only nut in the family. I like to subject myself to torture.'' When she played <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and His Times,'' a CBS miniseries, she had to quickly enlist her niece, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>, to play a bit part as one of the <PERSON> Kennedys </PERSON>' children. `` They had put in a call to general casting to send down two sets of twins. They sent an Oriental set and an Hispanic set,'' she recalled. `` They're going, ` No, these are supposed to be <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s children!' <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>, then 3, performed so admirably, director <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chomsky </PERSON> leaped up and shouted, `` Give her her -LRB- Screen Actors Guild -RRB- card! Give her her card!'' she recalled proudly. <PERSON> Cartwright </PERSON> pulls out another photograph of `` my bear,'' her husband, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Compton </PERSON>, on the set of a `` Miami Vice'' episode he was directing. They moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last August after he just up one day and announced he was sick of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. `` I was n't going to divorce him just because he wanted to move to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' she said. The city does seem to have won her over since they moved here. `` I was walking to the post office one day, ... and this guy is walking by goes, ` I love your work! Thank you so much!' and kept on walking. You go, ` Thanks!' I mean, it makes you feel so great! They know what you've been in. And here, they'll tell you. They do n't bug you about it, they just want you to know that they like it. In <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> they do n't do that. It's terribly flattering.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is a mythical centaur. He's also Rocky, a human television set and a warrior in what is billed as the first art exhibit to feature a sitting president These images of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> by nearly 40 artists, including <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grooms </ORGANIZATION>, appear in an exhibit titled `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>: American Icon'' at <ORGANIZATION> Bucknell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s Center Gallery. The show, featuring works done in the past eight years, opened Jan. 14 and will run through March 23. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will yield the presidency to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Jan. 20. `` It's unprecedented that a president has had contemporary artists do this many images of him,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON>, the gallery's director, who added that the exhibit was the first of its kind for a president still in office. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> interpretations range from flattering to critical, but <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON> was quick to point out the exhibit was put together based on the quality of the art, not politics. `` You do n't go out of your way to offend someone with an art exhibit, but on the other hand, art is not docile. We do want to arouse people; we want to make them think,'' he said. The show includes: _ Two <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> screenprints of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heusen </PERSON> shirt advertisements published during the president's acting days. _ A mock wooden toy by Red Grooms showing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> standing on a missile connected to four wagon wheels titled `` Nuclear Nuts.'' _ A heroic depiction of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a centaur _ half horse, half man _ by the Moscow-born artists <PERSON> Komar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melamid </PERSON>. _ A ceramic image by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Arneson </PERSON> of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a television set, the president's smiling face coming out of the screen, a wire hand as the antenna and a warning on the back: `` Do not expose this appliance to thought or reason.'' _ A painting by Israeli-born artist <PERSON> Ori </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofmekler </PERSON> titled `` Ronnie II'' showing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as the <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> movie character Rocky Balboa, sporting boxing gloves and shorts and wearing a championship belt with the presidential seal on it. _ A lifelike portrait of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> by <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON>, with the president's face covered by tiny, nearly invisible logos of all of the Fortune 500 companies. The show contains two paintings of <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and one of the president and first lady together. It also has books, articles, posters, photographs, buttons, T-shirts and postcards about the Reagans culled from <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON>'s personal collection of 50,000 books and 50 filing cabinets filled with memorabilia about celebrities ranging from <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> to the artist <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON> said he conceived the idea for the show several years ago but did not think enough work with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as the subject would exist until at least 1991. To find the work, <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON> quizzed museum directors, talked to artists and went to galleries in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` It was just detective work tracking down the material,'' he said. `` When I began the search I did n't know there was enough for a show. I was sort of groping. Who would have guessed?'' <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON>, who has a doctorate in art history from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> when he was <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s governor, said the show is historically significant because it is done by artists while <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was still in office. `` This will be a show that will be a watershed,'' he said. `` There's probably no other show at any other museum devoted to one person. There just is n't the material.'' Even though almost all of the images of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> depict him in his role as president, it was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former life as an actor which attracted the artists, <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON> said. `` I do think it's this duality of his life. ... It's captured the imagination of a lot of contemporary artists,'' he said.

<HEAD>Ignore The Urgent ``Free'' Advice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There is an enormous vested interest these days in offering ordinary Americans financial advice, and it is likely to burgeon rather than diminish because it is profitable. It is made up of diverse practicioners, including bankers, brokers, financial planners, lending officers, mutual funds sales people, insurance agents, direct mail sellers, financial publications and others with something to peddle. It is motivated by profit as much as it is by any instinct to deliver you from your financial bondage, and the message is invariably the same: You must do something immediately about your financial situation. These are troubled times, and the troubles will be yours if you do n't act now, today. Confronted with such a blizzard of advice, some of which you might have observed is contradictory, what must you do? Answer: Nothing. Based on the experience of the past, your chances in doing nothing rather than something might leave you no worse off _ and probably much better off _ than if you had acted too quickly and rashly. Some reminders: _ Attempting to adjust to every short-term financial twist can be extremely costly Experience in the stock market shows that in-out traders do no better, and often far worse, than those who stay put through good times and bad. _ There is a huge difference between investing and trading Investing is a long-term transaction with a long-term payoff. Trading is an attempt to make short-term gains. It is the livelihood of Wall Street. It is n't yours. _ You are not incompetent Most Americans are smart enough to make sound financial decisions, in spite of what sometimes seems a concerted effort to make them feel inadequate to the task. Take it from <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, manager of the Magellan Fund, which in 11 years has gained close to 1,900 percent. In a soon-to-be published book, <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> comments that the ordinary person can do better without professional advice. `` Investing on your own is going to mean ignoring the hot tips, the recommendations from brokerage houses and the latest ` ca n't miss' suggestions from your favorite newsletter in favor of your own research,'' he says Numerous studies, and the experience of many small investors and investment clubs, adds documentation to his thesis. So convinced is he of this point of view that he calls `` professional investing'' an oxymoron _ contradictory. _ The latest urgent advisory about what you should do is likely to be followed within a year by still another that, experience shows, will send you off in a different direction altogether _ There are few real experts who advertise their wares publicly Many who claim expertise also claim credentials that fail to withstand examination. Any adviser can show winners. What about the losers? _ There are no `` sure things'' available to the general public Neither are there secret tax shelters that have n't been exposed to the public eye. Certainly, no adviser has one that others do n't know about. None of this will ever stop financial advice from pouring forth, of course, because it is a product that sells well in a free marketplace. And that means it is yours to ignore as well as buy.

 The sinking New Year's Eve of an overcrowded tourist boat off <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> has sparked a nationwide outcry against what many Brazilians feel is the impunity of the rich and powerful and a general disrespect for law. In public demonstrations, Brazilians have made the tragedy, in which 52 passengers and crew died, a forum to rail against a widespread sense that in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> people in the right places can get away with lawbreaking _ from running red lights to hiring professional killers. `` Some of the worst vices of the Brazilian soul came to light the moment the boat sank: facility to bribe, irresponsibility and the failure to assist fellow citizens in trouble,'' the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Jornal </ORGANIZATION> do Brasil of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> said in an editorial. There has been no accurate count of the number of revelers on the Bateau Mouche when it capsized and sank on its way to an annual fireworks display off <LOCATION> Copacabana </LOCATION> beach. A widely accepted figure is 150. The flat-bottomed river boat was built to carry 20 passengers. Survivors claim it was dangerously overcrowded and listing badly in rough water and that lifejackets were not readily accessible. There are accusations _ as yet unproved _ that <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> guards who inspected the Bateau Mouche just two hours before it went down were paid off to allow it to venture into the open sea. The navy and the police are bickering over which group should investigate the sinking. There is widespread fear that no one will be held responsible _ as happened so often before here in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest country, in highway and maritime tragedies, fires and collapses of buildings and freeways. In 1981, for example, two riverboat sinkings in <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> waters claimed about 500 lives. Both resulted from overcrowding, yet no one was ever prosecuted. `` The sinking of the Bateau Mouche is a portrait of our reality,'' political commentator <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said in a syndicated newspaper column. `` We were already irresponsible, now we are becoming inhuman.'' `` There is a cultural tradition of disregarding security norms, of negligence,'' said <PERSON> Evaristo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Moraes </PERSON>, a lawyer for the owners of the Bateau Mouche. `` We need to look at our mentality, which believes that laws are always flexible.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Moraes </PERSON> added, however, that in the case of the boat disaster, `` I am convinced my clients had no responsibility whatsoever.'' Indeed, one of the owners of the boat initially told reporters that `` panic among the passengers'' was the cause of the tragedy. <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, a son-in-law of the Bateau Mouche's 50-year-old captain, <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON>, who drowned, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, `` <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> did n't want to go out He called us to say the boat was overloaded and the sea was too rough. But he had no choice. He would lose his job if he did n't sail.'' Brazilians are proud of what they call `` jeitinho,'' or a `` little way'' of cutting through red tape, avoiding a traffic ticket or eliminating a problem that has become intertwined with self-definitions of national character. There is a whole professional category known as `` despachantes,'' whose job consists basically of paying off the right people. A recent prime-time TV soap opera, `` Vale Tudo -LRB- Anything Goes -RRB-, drew ratings of 80 percent with its portrayals of greed, conniving, corruption and deceit among it principal characters. But it is n't exclusively a lack of respect for laws that has generated a sense of impunity in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, said Deputy Justice Minister <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichenberg </PERSON>. `` This also has grown from a tremendous lack of human and material resources,'' he said. `` We often are physically and financially unable to enforce the law.'' Many Brazilians are determined that the Bateau Mouche case not be forgotten. Theater and movie personalities _ outraged by the drowning of the well-known actress <PERSON> Yara </PERSON> <PERSON> Amaral </PERSON> _ along with <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> city </LOCATION> councilmen and other well known figures have organized to demand that police determine responsibility in the sinking. Brazilians also have rallied around the shooting death in December of the internationally known ecologist <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>, who sought to defend the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>'s ecology and its poor peasants against the interests of powerful landowners. Many employ private gunmen to eliminate enemies. According to <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based human rights organization, about 1,000 peasants, ecologists and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priests, who defend landless farmers, have been killed in land disputes in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> since 1980. Only three cases have been prosecuted, the organization says.

 Profound changes are at work in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, sent reeling this decade with blows to its auto, steel and farming powerhouses. For autos, the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> was the place, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> the hub. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> also boasted auto plants. Now, Japanese automakers are setting up shop in rural, largely white communities and jobs are becoming increasingly scarce for big-city blacks. The first story in a four-part AP Extra series, `` The Changing Heartland,'' examines this trend.

 With a college campus and fertile fields, this patch of <ORGANIZATION> mid-America </ORGANIZATION> is a place where students learn and farmers earn side by side. But corn country has a new face producing a new crop _ cars. Last fall, this tranquil town and its twin city, <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, joined a growing number of smaller <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> locales with Japanese-associated plants that are shaking up the auto industry. The increasing Japanese presence in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s midsection _ plants in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, one planned for <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Chrysler-Mitsubishi </PERSON> here _ is creating work and growth in white rural areas while jobs and opportunity disappear in heavily minority big cities. `` Certainly, it's a restructuring of the auto industry,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> urban affairs and sociology professor. `` The reorganization ... is definitely detrimental to blacks.'' The trend has aroused concern in a business that's already lost thousands of blue-collar jobs, raised questions about potential bias, and worried blacks, who've long regarded the auto industry as a steppingstone to a better life. `` Auto shops were really the bridge that brought black people from the lower class to the middle class,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, former head of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> local at a closed <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> plant. `` What are you going to do for the people left behind, locked up in the ghetto who have no place to go and no car to get out to rural areas?'' Japanese automakers, who've invested $ 5 billion in U.S.-based facilities in the last decade, point to their affirmative action programs and insist transportation, education and the work ethic _ not race _ determine location. But some academics also claim the Japanese generally avoid unionized areas and towns with large pools of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> autoworkers, preferring to train novices. Whatever the reason, communities such as Bloomington-Normal _ thriving, white-collar towns that are worlds apart from gasping-for-survival, blue-collar cities like <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> _ are becoming motor capitals. `` It's just a different culture,'' said <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Smart </PERSON>. `` This whole city is like a big neighborhood. -LRB- And -RRB- with modern auto plants being clean, it's not smokestack anymore; it's compatible with agriculture. In Bloomington-Normal, insurance, farming and academia are big. Urban blight, crime and unemployment are not. Bloomington-Normal, 4 percent minority, had a 4.1 percent unemployment rate in October. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, 65 percent minority, had a 10.1 percent jobless level. Studies have shown black men have been devastated by industrial decline. In the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area, 52 percent of black men in heavy manufacturing production lost their jobs from 1979 to 1984, according to a study by <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> State's <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. Nationwide, about 27 percent of blacks lost their heavy manufacturing jobs in the same period, said the study, based on <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> reports. Future prospects are even bleaker. A 1988 study concluded Japanese `` behavior with regard to site location and hiring practices heightens rather than eases the dilemma of blacks who are being rapidly displaced from their traditional American employers.'' The study, by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> professors <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Deskins </PERSON>, said although they had no concrete evidence, they believe `` avoidance of blacks is one factor'' for the Japanese in determining plant sites. `` I think it's a factor,'' <PERSON> Deskins </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't say this is their intent.'' The study found while blacks comprise 11 percent of the civilian labor force, they represent 17.2 percent of workers at the Big Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers. In contrast, the study said, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s plant in <LOCATION> Flat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, has a potential black labor pool of 29 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, has one of 10.5 percent. Company officials say their black workforce is 15.1 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> disagreed with the calculations and also pointed out the company recruits at black colleges. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, however, agreed last March to give $ 6 million to 377 blacks and women after an <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> investigation concluded they should have been hired sooner. The <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> claimed <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> employed discriminatory practices with a 30-mile hiring radius that excluded <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which has the area's largest minority population. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, which expanded its hiring area before the settlement, admitted no wrongdoing. Many Japanese-associated auto plants are close to universities and near Interstate 75, dubbed Auto Alley, which stretches south from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> is in <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, near the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION>; Chrysler-Mitsubishi is in Normal, home of <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> Subaru-Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is near <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, across the river from <LOCATION> Purdue </LOCATION>. These towns say automakers are attracted to cheaper land, lower taxes, open space and a well-educated work force. Bloomington-Normal, population 87,718, was appealing because of its good highway and rail systems, incentives, strong work ethic and schools, said <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Diamond-Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the firm formed by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION>. `` We needed people with very good communication skills _ verbal, written and reading,'' he said. `` Some of the major larger cities have a very difficult time graduating significant numbers of students.'' In <LOCATION> Tippecanoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, surrounding <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, one in four people 25 years and older has four years of college, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lafayette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit development corporation. `` What kind of public education system does <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> have?'' he asked. `` What kind of technological capability in terms of college graduates does <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> have? `` There's no God-given right big cities should be viewed as the automotive centers,'' he said. `` We small towns, technologically sophisticated centers, think we can compete, too.''

 They do, engaging in fierce bidding wars, offering free land and water, road and sewer improvements, employee training funds and tax abatements. Chrysler-Mitsubishi received $ 88.7 million in state incentives alone, including 630 acres of farm land. `` Nobody ever offered us a site in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> ... Detroit ... -LRB- or -RRB- <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. Experts also say Japanese automakers prefer areas where unions are n't strong. `` They're afraid wages will be high,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` They're afraid unions will create demands that will make the company unproductive.'' <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> is atypical _ it is 25 miles from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and, spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said, the only wholly owned subsidiary of a Japanese automaker with <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> affiliation. `` If you're going to locate in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said, `` you best be prepared to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>, because of its location, also has many former Big Three employees _ nearly a fourth of its workers. But <PERSON> Vladmir </PERSON> <PERSON> Pucik </PERSON>, international business professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, said the Japanese prefer `` a relatively inexperienced labor force so they can train them in the Japanese way of doing things. They want to go somewhere so nobody will say, ` At <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, we did it differently.'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> conceded Chrysler-Mitsubishi sought fresh faces. `` We did n't want to have another car plant that -LRB- would -RRB- have 20 years of experience transferred to our plant,'' he said. `` We wanted some green people when it comes to building cars.'' But he said any suggestion race was involved in site selection was `` utter nonsense'' and any charge `` we selected a town to stay away from a union ... is absolutely and unequivocally dead wrong.'' The plant was built with a 100 percent unionized labor force. <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> Mayor Smart says the Japanese will be happy they built here. `` When you get into any rural setting, people are not afraid to put in long hours,'' he said. `` Here there's a satisfaction in seeing the end result. You're just bred that way.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Market Share: _ Japanese companies increased their share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market from about 8 percent in 1976 to about 23 percent in 1987. _ An estimated 2.08 million Japanese imports and 737,513 `` transplants'' _ cars built totally or partly by the Japanese at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sites _ were sold in this country last year. That accounted for 26.6 percent of the 10.52 million cars purchased in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Imports include cars such as the Dodge Colt, built by <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Transplants include products of joint U.S.-Japanese ventures, such as the Ford Probe, built by <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>. _ The number of transplant autos built in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has risen steadily. The Wefa Group, an economic consulting organization, estimates Japanese transplants in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will total 1.7 million cars in 1990, compared with 600,000 in 1986.

 Imports: _ <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> exported 2.21 million cars to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1987 fiscal year, which ended last March. The Japanese government said shipments in the April-November period were 10.4 percent below those of a year earlier, but it still estimates <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will have exported 2.2 million cars to this country when the current fiscal year ends in March. In 1981, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> imposed a voluntary export restraint in response to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> political pressure. It first limited annual exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to 1.68 million units. The cap was increased in steps to 2.3 million units in 1985. It has remained there since. Some Japanese automakers feel the quota is outdated because domestic car prices have become more attractive against the cost of Japanese cars, driven upward as the yen doubled in value over the last three years.

 Exports: _ In 1986, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> produced 12.5 million vehicles and exported 40,000. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> produced 12.2 million vehicles, 6.6 million of which were exported.

 Japanese Investment: _ In the 1980s, Japanese automakers have invested $ 5 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assembly plants for cars and light trucks. _ Seven automakers and more than 100 auto parts suppliers with partial or total Japanese ownership are operating or building plants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Since 1984, the number of Japanese-affiliated auto suppliers has nearly doubled in this country.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Job Loss: _ A 1988 <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report said Japanese-affiliated automakers could cause the loss of 45,000 jobs in the industry in 1990 if there was a high displacement rate -LRB- ` transplant' autos built in lieu of domestic cars -RRB-, a production level of 1.8 million vehicles by those companies and 50 percent of the cars' parts and materials were made in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> compared with 83 percent for traditional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers. But the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> said the government underestimated the potential job loss due to transplants. The union said up to 74,000 jobs could be lost. _ The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> estimated a job loss of 360,000 from 1985 to 1990 from all factors, including transplants, gains in productivity, rising auto imports and increased use of foreign parts. However, the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> estimate was 470,000, noting Japanese-affiliated plants have built only a third of planned capacity. _ From 1985 to 1987, 169,000 auto manufacturing jobs have disappeared. That includes workers at the plants as well as those employed by industry suppliers.

<TEXT>
 Minorities: _ In 1984, according to reports filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, blacks comprised 17.2 percent of all workers employed by the Big Three automakers and 8.4 percent of white-collar employees. Blacks make up nearly 11 percent of the civilian labor force. _ <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> estimated its 1987 payroll for its black employees was $ 3 billion. The March 1988 Current Population Survey estimated total 1987 wage and salary income for 12.9 million blacks was $ 178.8 billion. So, although <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s black workers represented just six-tenths percent of all black employees, they received 1.7 percent of the nation's black wage and salary income in 1987.

But cow country is swiftly developing into a supercomputer corridor, where some of the fastest, costliest and most mind-boggling machines in the world are created. With $ 50 million in incentives as a sweetener, this ex-lumber mill town lured a different breed of builder: supercomputer wizard <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, whose young company hopes to construct a new machine 100 times faster than any that exists. Target completion date: the early 1990s. `` Every state in the nation wanted this,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eau </PERSON> <PERSON> Claire </PERSON>'s economic development specialist. `` It definitely is a major coup. ... This has just as much impact as an auto plant would have for <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>'s firm has n't created many jobs yet and there's not even a guaranteed product, but his locating here in 1987 further establishes the upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> as the nation's supercomputer capital. The region was already home to <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and founder <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Cray </PERSON>, the guru of supercomputers, as well as the industry's second major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> player _ <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Now joining them is <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supercomputer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> They are all within 100 miles of each other in northwestern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and southeastern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. They have followed a path laid down just after World War II, when several retired naval intelligence officers founded <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, and built code-cracking computers for the government. ERA was later bought out by UNIVAC, which years later spawned <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cray </PERSON> helped start <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>, then formed his own company in 1972. <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, has a major base 11 miles from here, in <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> recently expanded to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, but most of his workers are in the two Midwestern states. <PERSON> Cray </PERSON> hired <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, who left to start his own firm 16 months ago. Now these neighbor rivals are competing to create a machine faster than those that already do billions of calculations a second and help design cars, forecast weather and aid in weapons research. `` They're both after the fastest gun in the West,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, a computer consultant in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>'s oiling up his holster.'' Having so much brainpower battling to build the world's biggest and best supercomputer in so small a region lends new prominence to a part of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> probably better known for breweries and bitter cold than breakthroughs. `` This places <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> on the international map,'' said <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, director of technology assessment at the <ORGANIZATION> Super </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Performance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a marketing-forecasting firm. `` It adds prestige. It's sort of the difference between a Chevrolet assembly plant in your area and a Rolls Royce -LRB- plant -RRB-,'' he said. `` They do n't think of us as dairy and flour milling states any more.'' Some predict this industry will have a ripple effect, attracting parts and supply businesses. <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> said hundreds of companies in the Twin Cities area, such as <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> and 3M, are already involved in advanced technology. Some have grander visions. `` The potential is here to develop these businesses and offshoots into a <LOCATION> mini-Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claire </ORGANIZATION>. But there are big differences between <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the focus is on microprocessors _ materials for many everyday products. Supercomputers are more elite, with only about 350 installed worldwide, many in government and corporate offices, and expensive, costing $ 10-25 million each, <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> said. `` In terms of dollars this is a very small corner of the total computer market,'' said <PERSON> Tad </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinkerton </PERSON>, director of information technology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Madison </ORGANIZATION>. `` Even if you have 100 machines at $ 10 milion apiece, that's not a lot of money.'' Some Midwesterners also say they do n't care to duplicate some things about the <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, particularly its explosive growth. `` <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> has a very progressive social environment, one which is going to move cautiously in things like building,'' <PERSON> Pinkerton </PERSON> said. Even <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>'s company will grow slowly. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, who formed a partnership with <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, talks of taking four to five years to build his computer. Employment, now about 100, is n't expected to reach 1,000 until the late 1990s. Despite the wait, <ORGANIZATION> Eau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claire </ORGANIZATION>, population 58,000, had few qualms about offering <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> a $ 50 million package of grants and federally guaranteed loans, even though it was $ 4 million more than the city's annual budget The city is lending $ 1.5 million of the $ 31.2 million loan package. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>'s bank is responsible for the rest. The deal calls for a federal agency to guarantee $ 25 million in loans, which have n't been approved yet. Despite the risks, <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON> said, `` This was the chance of a lifetime. It's the first time we seriously played with the big boys and went after a nationally known famous person.'' <PERSON> Eau </PERSON> <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> and other cities began wooing <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> when he left <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> in September 1987 after the company canceled his supercomputer project, saying his proposal was too risky and too costly. He decided on <ORGANIZATION> Eau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claire </ORGANIZATION>, in part to avoid moving the 40 <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> workers he'd attracted to his company. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> has also opened a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurant in town. His company has created an influx of new residents who <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON> said are responsible for raising the average cost of a house to $ 105,000, up $ 20,000 from 1987. `` You're always looking for clean, high-tech industry,'' <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON> added. `` They pay high wages. It brings an intellect to your community with scientists and engineers. It's an environment people like to work in.'' That was n't always the image of this northwestern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> town, named for its clear waters. In the 19th century, <PERSON> Eau </PERSON> <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> was white-pine country, home to logger barons. With 20 sawmills on its river banks, it was nicknamed `` Sawdust City.'' A century later, in 1981, an almanac ranked Eau Claire No. 1 in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for most taverns per person _ one for every 629 people. <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON> said being home to one of a handful of supercomputer companies in the world will give <ORGANIZATION> Eau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claire </ORGANIZATION> new visibility. `` People around the nation,'' he said, `` will know who we are now.''

 They're super-swift high-tech superstars that can do anything from design nuclear warheads to build a better yacht. Supercomputers are used by the government, the military, universities and Fortune 500 companies to help crack codes, forecast weather, design aircraft, conduct geological exploration or simulate the effects of nuclear explosions. `` The supercomputer is important economically and socially,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, a computer consultant in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. `` They're used in everything from the mundane to the sublime _ designing appliances ... to developing new life-saving techniques and surgery. That range, he said, can help shape <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s role in the world economy. `` The whole name of the game is competitive advantage in the international market,'' said <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, director of technology assessment at the <ORGANIZATION> Super </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Performance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a marketing-forecasting firm. `` The key to maintaining that competitive advantage is faster design, reduced government certification time, better testing.'' The two major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supercomputer companies are <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Its competition: three Japanese computer giants _ <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> There also are about three dozen smaller, so-called `` mini-supercomputer'' companies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> said. Some experts believe the Japanese are threatening <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s dominance of the industry `` We opened a very large lead and we no longer have that large lead,'' <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> said. One of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s main advantages, he said, is it has the `` lion's share of semiconductor -LRB- computer chips -RRB- market We gave up on the semiconductor industry.'' But other experts say it's too early to talk of the Japanese overtaking the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Even though <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> machines use a lot of Japanese components, I do n't think it's fair to say they're ahead in any way, shape or form,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Burwen </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Palo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm. `` There are a lot of people who say the Japanese are a very big threat to supercomputers,'' he said. `` I do n't think the evidence is in. The Japanese certainly have not been able to demonstrate they can penetrate anything outside their home market in this business.'' About 350 supercomputers have been installed worldwide. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customers include <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, location of the first <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION>, introduced in 1976. Supercomputers can do billions of calculations a second. For example, a Bible concordance _ an alphabetical referencing by word _ that took a scholar 17 years to do in the mid-1700s and required 1,000 hours on a computer in 1956 can be done on a <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> supercomputer in 20 seconds, <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> said. Although experts sometimes disagree on what a supercomputer is, it generally is described as the fastest, largest, most expensive machine at any time _ one that can do problems others ca n't. <PERSON> Burwen </PERSON> also said 44 percent of all supercomputers are in private industry, 37 percent in government installations, and 19 percent in universities. Nowadays, supercomputers are changing industry, because products `` can not only be designed and prototyped on screen, but be tested and evaluated ... and have complete data performance before you touch tool to steel,'' he said. Automakers, for one, `` can do a design in six months instead of 18 months,'' he said. `` You can literally take years off the design cycle.'' Supercomputers have also begun to simulate crash testing for autos. And oil companies use supercomputers to get the best production in petroleum exploration. `` If they get 1 percent -LRB- more oil -RRB- out of a reservoir, it pays for itself 100 times over,'' <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> said. `` What if it's a $ 10 million computer if you get $ 20 billion -LRB- more oil -RRB- out of a reservoir?'' Among <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION>'s customers are <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Big Three automakers, <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> and petroleum giants such as <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> supercomputer also was used to help design Stars & amp; Stripes, the yacht <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> sailed in 1987 when he won the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup. Two competing syndicates also used Cray technology, said company spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON>. Scientists designing supercomputers are toiling in an industry constantly trying to produce faster machines. <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> plans to have a new supercomputer ready this year or next, and it's expected to be 100 times faster than his original machine. In 1992-94, he hopes to produce the Cray-4, 1,000 times more powerful. And, <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> said, that wo n't be the end. As he explained, `` We still do n't see the limit.''

 The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> shoreline of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> is home to the nation's steel giants. And perhaps no Rust Belt city better typifies a steel town than <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>. The steel slump of the'80s hit hard in <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION>, already struggling with crime, decay and a declining tax base. But steel is making a comeback and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> hopes it can, too.

 This steel town has long been a four-letter word for all that's gone wrong in industrial <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: a shrinking workforce, sooty skies, a sorry future. With the city's fate tied to steel's fortunes, when the industry hurts, so does <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>. Now that steel is surging, this archetypal Rust Belt city says it is on the mend, too. Unemployment is down, companies are moving in, real estate is being snatched up. More importantly, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> is looking beyond steel _ a lakefront marina is planned and an airport project is being pushed. `` We're on an upturn now,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>. `` The optimism we feel is not because we've resolved the problems that exist. It's because we're right now on a track to resolving them. There's growth as opposed to further decline. People are taking another look at <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>.'' They will still find a depressed city _ shuttered stores, gutted homes and a bleak downtown with no hotel or department store. But there also is new prosperity due, in part, to a leaner, profitable steel industry that's been boosted by increasing demand, import limits, the low dollar and new technology. After losses of almost $ 12 billion in 1982-86, the industry nationwide earned $ 1 billion in 1987 and is expected to double that for 1988. That improvement has contributed to an upturn in <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> and other parts of northwestern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, site of the world's greatest concentration of steel-making capacity. For example: _ Five steel companies in <LOCATION> Porter </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> counties, the latter including <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, have spent more than $ 2.5 billion on their facilities since 1982, said the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s No. 1 steel producer; 22 percent of the nation's steel is made there. The industry pumps almost $ 20 million daily into <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s economy. _ Unemployment in the <LOCATION> Gary-Hammond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, area fell from 15.7 percent in 1982-83 to 9.5 percent in 1987; the 1987 numbers would have been lower but for a six-month walkout at USS Gary Works, the city's biggest employer and flagship of <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. November's unemployment rate was 6.1 percent; 1988 was the first year this decade without double-digit employment in any month Those figures, however, do not reflect huge population losses. The area's labor force shrunk by 38,100 from 1980 to November 1988 _ New and expanding businesses in the <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION> area have filled 12.4 million square feet of industrial space and created almost 6,500 jobs since 1984. Much of the growth is steel-related. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> `` is one of the best heavy industrial locations in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, an investor and redeveloper. `` You're close to all the major manufacturers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Most of these peoples' customers are nearby. You've got very inexpensive rents and real estate costs. `` If someone needs steel, you're going to be near the biggest and cheapest source of supply nationwide,'' added <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, who has helped 24 companies, some from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, expand or settle in the area. The new-and-improved status may even be reflected in a 1988 Money magazine survey that ranked the <LOCATION> Gary-Hammond </LOCATION> area 41st among 300 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> living spots _ two slots above considerably more picturesque <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> and up from 92nd place a year earlier. That might seem surprising, considering <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>'s reputation as aging, crime-infested and polluted. City planner <PERSON> Taghi </PERSON> <PERSON> Arshami </PERSON> says that's more myth than reality, though he concedes <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>'s center section, with a vacancy rate equal to 20 acres, is devastated. `` The problem we have generally for downtown is lack of investment, lack of confidence on the part of business and on the part of banks that are not willing to put the money down,'' he said. But he is optimistic about developing <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>'s downtown into a public and service sector hub, noting that 12,000 people work there. Some of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>'s image problems stem from lean times of the last decade. Jobs and people disappeared, unemployment soared. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>'s population, now about 137,000, fell 10 percent from 1980 to 1986 Even now, experts say, growth in northwestern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> is occurring in rural areas. The mills shrank, too, while becoming more efficient. Northwestern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> now has 35,300 steelworkers, a 47 percent drop from 1979. USS Gary Works has 7,500 workers, compared with 21,000-22 ,000 in the late 1970s Although mill investments spur related business, some say <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> is in a precarious position because it remains so dependent on steel. `` The danger of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> is not that they are n't doing fairly well,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON>, professor emeritus of industrial relations at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` -LRB- But -RRB- they're likely to delude themselves into thinking that what they're doing is the most powerful influence.'' Instead, he said, bigger factors are external _ demand, the dollar and the nation's economy. `` <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> is doing good work for itself. That's commendable,'' he said. `` -LRB- But -RRB- one does n't want to think that's the whole picture.'' Some business leaders concede the region has done a poor job of diversifying, but others point to such changes as the growth of the health industry, which provides 20,400 jobs in the area. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> is also touting recreation. Promotional brochures feature the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dunes </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, photos of children bicycling along the beach, a golden sunset over shimmering waters and a local boy who made good _ <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` We have one of the largest fresh water bodies anywhere in the world,'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said. `` We have far from taken full advantage of it.'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> hopes to rectify that with an ambitious $ 150 - $ 200 million, 1,400-slip marina adjacent to the USS site that could eventually include a hotel, shopping center and amphitheater Officials hope to build the first 250 slips this year. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> also hopes to have the third commercial airport in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area. Its present airport provides only charter and private corporate service. An expanded airport would relieve congestion at <ORGANIZATION> O'Hare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and Midway in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. One report said it would attract 6.5 million passengers to <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> annually and create 122,000 jobs with a payroll of $ 1.6 billion. Though these projects are critical, <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said the city also has `` a much healthier manner of looking at problems,'' whether it's cleaning up illegal dumps or addressing housing needs `` There's already a renewed spirit of cooperation that has n't existed in 20 years,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, transportation planner for the <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> `` People,'' he said, `` feel a lot more confident about <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>'s future.

 Here are some facts about the steel industry, provided by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. They represent reports from 25 companies representing 80 percent of the industry. _ Profits-Losses: The nation's steel industry is expected to post a 1988 profit of about $ 2 billion. In 1987, profits were $ 1.02 billion, following losses of almost $ 12 billion in 1982-86. The rising profits are attributed to a general strengthening in the world steel market and a moderate increase in demand. _ Shipments: Domestic steel mill shipments are estimated to have risen from 76.7 million tons in 1987 to about 83 million tons in 1988 _ an 8.2 percent increase. _ Production: Raw steel production jumped from 89.2 million tons in 1987 to almost 100 million tons in 1988 _ a 12 percent increase. _ Employment: Average industry employment in 1988 was 170,000, slightly above the 1987 average of 163,000, the lowest since the institute started keeping records in 1933. The industry posted a record-high employment of 650,200 in 1953. _ Imports: Imports in 1988 will have accounted for about 20.5 percent of the steel shipped to consumers, compared with 20.9 percent in 1987. Imports reached a high of 26.4 percent in 1984, the year when the Voluntary Restraint Agreements set a goal of reducing imports to 20.2 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. The agreement expires this year. _ State Production: <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> leads the nation in steel production, with about 22 percent of the steel made there. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> accounts for 18 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> 13 percent.

 When <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Keitel </PERSON> returned from a life abroad two years ago, he yearned to settle on the soil he once called home. He was ready for <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was n't ready for him. Jobs were scarce. So was optimism. People were moving out, merchants were following. But over time, misery has given way to mending. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, a state that once typified the decline and despair of rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, is on the rebound. Consider <PERSON> Keitel </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> native who returned to a state thousands fled, found work where two years ago there was none, and is praising a land that not long ago was pitied. `` I think this place is a gold mine,'' says <PERSON> Keitel </PERSON>, a 36-year-old engineer who grew up on an eastern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farm. `` The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> economy is coming on strong,'' boasts Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>. `` We know we still have a long way to go, but we've come a long ways.'' Unemployment is down, revenues are up and there's a sense the worst is over. Some claim a bust-to-boom assessment is too rosy and premature, but the declining dollar, export opportunities, price supports and a diversifying economy have contributed to a turnaround. Consider: _ The value of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmland rose 20.4 percent in 1988, prompting the Des Moines Register headline `` <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Dirt Turns to Gold Again.'' The increase, reported in an <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study, was the largest since the mid-1970s. From 1981 to 1986, land values had plummeted 63 percent. _ <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s labor force reached an all-time high in October: 1.5 million people working or seeking jobs. Unemployment was 3.5 percent, the lowest since November 1979. In some areas, jobs outnumber residents. Mount Pleasant has about 5,000 people of working age but almost 12,000 jobs. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> soon plans to set up a nationwide toll-free number to lure back ex-Iowans who left in search of work. _ <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> is expected to have a $ 180 million budget surplus in the 1989 and 1990 fiscal years, a panel of financial experts said in December, although some of that will likely be eaten up with federal mandates. _ One in five <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmers has substantial money troubles, down from one in three in 1984-85, said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Harl </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> economics professor. _ <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the state's largest private employer with 14,800 workers, posted record fourth-quarter and year-end earnings. _ After six years in which <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> lost almost 100,000 people, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported last month state population increased by 11,000 from 1987 to 1988. Despite such numbers, some say last summer's drought will have a lingering impact. They also worry the state's upturn is bypassing rural areas where schools have closed, young people have departed and Main Street merchants have closed up shop. `` We have n't turned the corner yet by any means,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostendorf </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Prairiefire </LOCATION>, a rural advocacy group. `` Many of the rural counties still have poverty rates exceeding 20 percent.'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> says, though, that no state enjoys `` uniform prosperity. What we want to do is help those areas that are n't doing as well to help themselves.'' The state uses lottery proceeds, for instance, for economic development, some of the money going for loans, aid to local communities or research projects. Already, the upswing and growth in the meat packing and farm equipment industries have helped hard-hit blue-collar areas. In <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION>, unemployment fell from 8.8 percent last January to 4.3 percent in November. `` People feel we've bottomed out,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Waterloo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Deere </PERSON>, which has a giant local operation, has recalled workers; a leather processing plant recently opened, and a new <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> hog slaughtering plant is being built, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Mason </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, about 1,500 new jobs, many of them service sector and health-related, will be created in 1989 alone, compared with about 2,000 in the last five years combined, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jolas </PERSON>, an economic development consultant to the city. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s recovery is due, in part, to a declining dollar that makes grain and other products more competitive on the world market, said state economist <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegelman </PERSON>. `` There will be Winnebagos going to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, beef to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> tractors all over the world,'' he said. Just as critical is <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s effort to reduce its reliance on agriculture. `` The key to success is diversification,'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said. `` Some of it actually is building off the agricultural economy that already exists and finding new uses for products.'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> has also targeted several industries for development: telecommunications, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and insurance. <PERSON> Des </PERSON> <PERSON> Moines </PERSON> already is an insurance capital. <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION>, 28 miles from the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, learned to diversify decades ago. It's paid off. The town's business roster includes such corporate names as <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> distribution center opened in 1985. Mount Pleasant is also home to a large fireplace maker, a bulk mail distributor that claims more outgoing postage volume than <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, and a school bus manufacturer. `` We set an example of how we can control our own future,'' said <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, the local chamber's vice president. `` We appreciate the help of the state and federal government, but we will not sit back and depend on them.'' Mount Pleasant never hit the depths some <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> communities sank to in the mid-1980s, though the county unemployment rate was 8.1 percent in 1982-83. In November, it was 2.5 percent. In the last six months, two motels, four stores and a truck stop have opened. Officials say property values rose from $ 45 million to $ 130 million in the last decade; retail sales jumped 18.7 percent from March 1986 to March 1988. Mount Pleasant has also held onto its young people, offering jobs involving computers and lasers. `` There is n't a small town in the state of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> that has any more sophisticated industry than we have,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Vilsack </PERSON>. <PERSON> Keitel </PERSON> returned from <LOCATION> Saudia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> in 1986, ending up as an engineer in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> when he could n't find work in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Last fall he found a job in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> still has a lot to offer, even with all of its problems,'' he said. `` We have n't lost our sense of values. The quality of life still means more than the almighty dollar.'' <PERSON> Vilsack </PERSON> has another explanation: `` We ca n't do a lot about what's plaguing the small-town farmer. We've given families the opportunity to be in control of their own lives. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s got to take its destiny in its own hands.''

<TEXT>
 Kangaroos may soon end up on dinner plates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s most populous state. Animal welfare groups are hopping mad. They contend few Australians will want to feast on their national symbol but that tourists might. Conservationists called the decision `` disastrous'' and potentially dangerous because kangaroos carry a host of diseases. `` <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> -LRB- the comic star of `` Crocodile Dundee'' -RRB- is luring <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> tourists to <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, but all they are likely to see is a bloodbath,'' said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> of Australians for Animals, the country's largest wildlife conservation group. `` Kangaroos are shot by helicopter, poisoned, snared and used for pet food as well as an export industry. Now they're being offered for domestic human consumption. How can they survive?'' she said in an interview. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, hailed by the tourist industry for his `` throw another shrimp on the barbie'' commercials that brought a record 2 million visitors to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s bicentennial celebrations in 1988, has a new series to be screened in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in February. In the commercial, as reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Sydney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> says that `` God had a sense of humor'' when he desposited in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> `` the famous giant hopping mouse'' _ the kangaroo. Tourism Minister <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said the commercials are expected to contribute to a 20 percent growth in tourism this year. Five million tourists are expected by the year 2000, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, Manager of the government-funded Tourism <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Officials said a decision Jan. 6 to harvest kangaroos for human consumption will not endanger wildlife. The News <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> health minister, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, said the program is for farming kangaroos, not depleting wildlife stocks. The decision reverses a longstanding ban in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, of which <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> is the tourist gateway. Kangaroo meat already is consumed in the states of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Its is described extremely lean, full of protein and somewhat gamy, not unlike venison. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said his department would ensure that kangaroo meat is safe to eat, but <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> and others questioned how the state government planned to farm the creatures and maintain a standard that makes them fit for consumption. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s population is 16.5 million. The government's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> estimates the kangaroo population at about 15 million. An annual culling quota is about 3 million, with the meat used for pet food and skins turned into such goods as wallets and purses for export. `` What other country in the world slaughters its national symbol?'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a member of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> Parliament who was elected in 1987 on a platform of animal welfare. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> said kangaroos carry a range of diseases, such as salmonella, tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis and hydatid cysts, a worm that can be fatal. Farmers regard the kangaroo as a pest. The Greenpeace and Animal Liberation organizations, both supporters of Australians For Animals, said the decision represents a victory for the farm lobby. The <ORGANIZATION> Canberra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s capital, said the kangaroo industry is in chaos. It said there is compelling evidence of widespread illegal shooting and few controls on the transportation of skins and carcasses inter-state. Only licensed professional shooters are supposed to hunt kangaroos but conservationists and others maintain the government regulation is loosely enforced. `` At the end of the day, the only conclusion to be drawn is that the government controls on the kangaroo industry are worthless,'' the newspaper said in an editorial. <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION>, called the decision a disaster. `` It simply commercializes our wildlife,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves the White House with shoulders squared as ever, his wits and wit undiminished by the burdens which sent his recent predecessors into quicker retirement and aged some of them almost beyond his years. The Western sun beckons, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, nearly 78, enters the winter of his public life without melancholy, even as he claimed, with <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s assistance, that his departure evoked `` such sweet sorrow'' in his heart. More sweet than sorrow for this political <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON>. He relinquishes his power with relish, happily telling his conservative revolutionaries in his farewell address Thursday that `` My friends, we did it.'' History will be the judge of that, but one <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> success is indisputable: He stayed the course, and leaves the presidency with the same charm and equilibrium with which he entered it. No man, especially in the nuclear age, has proved so immune to <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' observation long ago that power is poison, and that its effect upon presidents is inexorably tragic <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` is totally comfortable with the fact of leaving and more relaxed about it every day,'' says spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` He's very satisfied that he has done everything he could do.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a typically light moment, said recently the first item on his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> agenda with be a long nap. `` Come to think of it,'' he added, `` things wo n't be all that much different, after all.'' A year earlier he observed that `` It's true that hard work never killed anybody. But I figure, why take the chance?'' He was, in fact, an often inattentive president, above the usual fray, operating more by instinct than intellect. Ever maddening to his critics, he made an art of sitting things out, like the poker champion who knows when to walk away from the table, when to return and bet the ranch. Eight years ago, he promised a `` revolution of ideas'' for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It may take decades to resolve the debate over how much he really changed the national course, and how much, for that matter, the national interest changed his own ideas. But certainly, in an era of glass-jawed politicians, he went the distance without disabling scar or scorn, and set a modern standard for survival. There's just a hint of gray now on that old <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> head, and he needs a hearing aid in both his ears. But nobody has aged less in the presidency, even in simpler times. Which is all the more remarkable, considering he was the oldest man ever to enter it, that he was nearly mortally shot that first year, that he needed surgeries, major and minor, for cancer. Or that his administration suffered failures and embarrassments that surely would have undone other presidents _ a staggering national debt, the loss of hundreds of Americans in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the bizarre sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the diversion of the profits to rebels in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the criminal convictions of close aides and a pervasive `` sleaze'' quotient through the years, colossal slips of the tongue and manglings of fact, and the worst stock market crash in six decades. Through all of that, the Iran-Contra affair opened the only crack in his famed Teflon veneer, triggering an overnight, 20-percent drop in his popularity rating. But even as the arms-for-hostages deal knocked him back on his heels, it was not, as diagnosed by some Democrats, an Achilles rupture. As usual, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> bounced back. He had many triumphs, and made good on much of his agenda, mostly on domestic policy the first term and foreign policy the second. He lowered taxes, radically altered the manner in which they are levied, improved the national defense and raised the national spirit. He relentlessly pushed the country through two painful years of high unemployment and recession that led to an unprecedented six straight years of recovery and growth, lowering inflation from 13 percent in 1980 to about 4 percent today. Unemployment fell by half, to just over 5 percent. His foreign policy produced a surprising number of successes. Foremost among them, in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s words, `` we have, the past few years, forged a satisfying new closeness with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' Some of that, doubtlessly, is more <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Irish luck than his doing _ <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, after all, did n't have <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to deal with. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> still had his own hands to play. Despite European resistance, he deployed Pershing II missiles aimed at the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and, ignoring domestic pleas for a nuclear `` freeze,'' stuck with his `` zero-option'' plan for intermediate nuclear weapons for six years. It paid off. The INF treaty eventually signed, the first ever to reduce nuclear arsenals, was entirely on his terms. He sent arms to the Afghan rebels, and the Soviets are finally leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He sent the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> called off their long, hideous war. Many believe his measured use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firepower, especially against <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafy </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, contributed to a decline in international terrorism His administration also helped end or temper regional conflicts in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The results were n't so rewarding in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and Americans are still held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, portrayed by his opponents in 1980 as a trigger-happy cowboy, leaves with a remarkable record for statesmanship. His presidency produced many contradictions. He campaigned on a promise to abolish two cabinet departments, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, and wound up instead adding one: Veterans Affairs. He put conservatives in the nation's courts, but his `` revolution'' barely disturbed local electorates, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> remained in Democratic hands. He promised to balance the budget, and, to this day, blames <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that it was n't done. But he never even proposed a budget that cae close. Instead, the national debt soared from $ 900 billion to over $ 2.6 trillion while he was in office, a painful tax against the nation's _ and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s _ future. For all his talk about a `` safety net'' for the nation's poor and disadvantaged, more families live below the poverty line now than when he took office. Similarly, he offered more rhetoric than remedy for the nation's drug crisis. To the consternation of even some Republican allies in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he often governed more by anecdote than analysis, stubbornly clinging to notions that had no foundation in fact. He once asserted, in an anti-abortion speech, that babies have been born after just three months of pregnancy, `` and have lived, the record shows, to grow up and be normal.'' But the White House could produce no such record, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obstetrics </ORGANIZATION> and Gynecology said there was no solid evidence that fetuses less than six months old can survive.

 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> repeatedly told the story of the woman who bought an orange with her food stamps, then spent the change on a bottle of vodka. She could n't be found, either. Change from food stamps, incidentally, is limited to 99 cents. To illustrate the evils of school busing for racial balance, he had a tale about how the daughter of the very woman who brought the landmark 1954 school desegregation suit now had to be bused miles from her home to attend class. But <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, daughter of <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, went to school two blocks from her home in <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>. What's more, <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> did n't have school busing for racial balance <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had lots of those. Remember the killer trees? Sometimes, he tripped over his own tongue as well as the facts. President <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> became `` Chairman <PERSON> Moe </PERSON>,'' and an open microphone caught him more than once in hip shots like `` All right, my fellow Americans, I am pleased to tell you today that I have signed legislation that will outlaw <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.'' Not everybody thought these things funny, but <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the Great Communicator, usually got away unscathed and unfazed. In part, doubtlessly, it was because he had such an infectious ability to disarm his critics by laughing at himself. And nobody deprecated <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Before the Discovery launch last year, he was asked if he'd like to go into space. `` I've been there for several years,'' he deadpanned. That kind of humor and modesty went a long way to stir a nation's perception of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as at once a normal man and a very special one <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> laughed with him, trusted him, admired his schoolboy optimism. And it forgave his indiscretions as family mischief. Educator and management consultant <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> wrote in `` Anatomy of Power,'' that `` great leaders, in bearing and behavior, make a distinction between authority and power,'' and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` never appears as an authority figure.'' Two other keys to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s success, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said, were his ability to communicate his sense of values, and his willingness to limit priorities. While <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> inundated <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the public, he noted, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called forth one issue at a time, never scattering his shot. <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> was the last president to serve two full terms, but he left tired and with his successor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, having campaigned on a promise `` to get <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> moving again.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> came along at a time when it appeared the national mood would hold any president to a single term. The presidency had been weakened by the overlapping traumas of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and Watergate, and, while <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> restored the integrity of the office, the country remained wearied as it confronted the frustrations of an energy crisis, runaway inflation and the the hostage-taking of Americans in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, in an ill-advised speech that sounded his own political epitaph, complained of a national malaise, in which Americans suffered `` a crisis of confidence.'' By the time the voters turned him out after four years, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had aged 10. It seemed that way with <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, too. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will be 78 on Feb. 6. But he looks and acts remarkably like the man who arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> eight years ago, full of exuberance. His waistline may have expanded an inch, but not much more has swelled. He arrived with a size 7 hat. It still fits, and that's a major reason why the nation remains so fond of him.

<HEAD>Wind Chill: It's More than Just a Number</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As anyone knows who has been outdoors on a windy winter day, moving air can seem to go right through layer after layer of clothing, chilling a person to the bone. And that wind chill is more than just a nasty sensation, or a number provided by the local weathercaster. It can be a serious hazard at this time of year. Those especially vulnerable to the dangers of cold are the very young and the very old, medical experts point out. But virtually anyone can become a victim of hypothermia, or extreme cooling of the body. The wind chill exists all the time, of course. Consider the pleasant summer day when it suddenly seems cold after emerging from a swimming pool. That's wind chill at work too, but it's not much of a hazard then. Come this time of year the wind can whisk away body heat faster than you can say `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>,'' leaving you shivering or worse. The reason is the body's own cooling mechanism depends on evaporation of moisture, a process that is very effective in removing heat. Moving air carries away molecules of evaporated water and the air that the body has warmed. More water then evaporates into the dry air, which the body has to heat, the result is that the process makes the body even cooler. And that, in reality, is the problem. The wind does n't make it colder, it carries away heat to make it cold faster. If the air is at 20 degrees Fahrenheit and the wind is 20 miles per hour the windchill is minus 10 degrees. People unfortunately exposed to these conditions wo n't actually cool down to minus 10. At the worst they will stop cooling at 20 degrees, when they reach the air temperatrure. But they will get there faster, cooling at the same rate as if the temperature were minus 10. So what this all means is listen to the latest weather reports before leaving the house and dress for the weather. Layers of clothing are more effective than one or two thick garments. Since more than half of the heat produced by the body can be lost through the head and neck, a cap or hat is vital in winter, the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physiology </ORGANIZATION> points out. Trapped air is the key to insulation, and there are several ways to do this. Animals use fur. Birds opt for feathers. People can manage the same effect with layers of warm clothing, especially wool and down garments which trap air in layers. Cold puts extreme stress on the body, which can prove deadly to people with heart of lung disease and to those whose bodies have poor heat regulation systems _ the very young and very old especially. The ill elderly can suffer at temperatures as high as 60 degrees, according to physicians, who urge that friends and family keep track of the old and ill at this time of year. Signs of hypothermia include changes in a person's appearance or behavior, uncontrollable shivering or total lack of shivering when it would be expected; stiff muscles, slow or irregular heartbeat, slurred speech, weak pulse, confusion, drowsiness and a drop in body temperature. Victims of hypothermia need rewarming and medical attention, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> stresses. While waiting for emergency medical help, <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> experts say, prevent further heat loss by wrapping the victim in a warm blanket. Hot water bottles or a warm heating pad _ not hot _ can help if placed on the victim's abdomen. If the victim is alert, small quantities of food and drink can help, but never give alcoholic beverages. Warming can also be accomplished by lying close to the victim and using one's body heat to warm them. But do not handle the victim too roughly. Rubbing, for example, can make things worse, the HHS experts warn. Besides the elderly, infants are in danger of hypothermia because their body heating systems may not yet be fully developed. Thus, parents and other adults need to pay close attention to the warmth of tots, Make sure they wear a cap, limit a baby's time outdoors and keep them as dry as possible, since moisture carries off heat quickly.

<HEAD>Oil Spills Still Fact Of Life After 20 Years Of Environmental Progress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>OCEAN SHORES, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Twenty years ago this month, a huge oil spill in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, helped launch the environmental movement with wrenching images of blackened beaches and lifeless, oil-soaked birds. This past week along the rugged <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coast, it appeared that despite 20 years of progress in environmental protection, some things have n't changed. `` It's horrible,'' said <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, 44, a volunteer at a makeshift `` dirty bird hospital'' set up in this tourist town's convention center to treat thousands of birds mired in a Dec. 22 oil spill `` Imagine going into a grocery store and suddenly seeing oil over all the food, then going outside and finding oil on your car, on your house, everything,'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said Thursday, scrubbing a terrified seabird in a pan of soapy water. `` That's how it is for these animals.'' It was this kind of scene that environmentalists hoped to prevent when they rallied together after the Jan. 28, 1969, blowout of an offshore <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> well in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION>. That accident spread an estimated 3 million gallons of crude oil along 150 miles of the southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast. Globs of tar blackened rocky cliffs and sandy beaches. Greasy mist coated beachside mansions. At least 3,600 birds died, even as volunteers worked around the clock to wash the oil from their feathers. Disgust and anger translated quickly into political action, spearheaded by a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> group called Get Oil Out, better known as GOO. Environmental awareness soon became politically fashionable, and the 1970s produced a raft of legislation tightening safety procedures required of oil producers and transporters. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> was born, and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was ordered to beef up inspections of oil tankers and barges. Oil interests and environmentalists agree that technological advances of the past two decades also have made the oil industry safer. Yet oil spills remain as much a fact of life as they were 20 years ago. Some 10,000 to 15,000 spills into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters are reported every year during transportation and storage of oil, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials say. Offshore drilling contributes 1,300 to 1,500 more spills a year. The vast majority of spills are small, sometimes no more than a gallon or two, but major spills are still a regular occurrence. 1988 was a particularly bad year: On Jan. 2, a storage tank collapsed upstream of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, spilling 1 million gallons of diesel fuel into the <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and affecting water supplies in three states. In April, 365,000 gallons of crude oil spilled from a refinery in <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. In July, a tanker crashed into a mooring structure in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, spilling 630,000 gallons of crude oil. In September, a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> tanker scraped bottom and spilled 1 million gallons of heavy oil. Finally, on Dec. 22, a tugboat tore a gash in the barge it was towing in rough seas off <LOCATION> Grays </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, spilling up to 231,000 gallons of heavy oil. Storms and strong currents spread the oil along 300 miles of coastline; the worst damage was along some of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s most pristine beaches, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Olympic National Park and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. About 6,000 birds have died; 3,000 more were spotted floundering along beaches and were taken to rescue centers like the one at <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION>. The painstaking bird cleanup may not be finished until the end of this month, and officials said they'll consider themselves lucky if half the cleaned birds survive. Like the 1969 <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> spill, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> accident promises to provide ammunition for foes of oil development. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> toured the <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION> bird hospital and vowed to continue fighting oil exploration that the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is planning for federal waters off the state's Olympic Peninsula Environmentalists in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> said the spill will bolster their efforts to keep offshore drilling at bay. They also want the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to tighten its inspections of oil transporters, and they are lobbying for better methods of assessing the ecological damage of oil spills. `` This spill has certainly brought home to people that we ca n't wait for things to happen We have to get involved now,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> representative of Friends of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. But an industry spokesman said those who would prevent oil spills should not oppose offshore drilling. Less offshore development will mean greater reliance on tanker-delivered foreign oil, which has a much higher record of spills, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Fergus </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Offshore oil drilling has an excellent safety record, he said. Between 1980 and 1987, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offshore oil platforms spilled a total of 291 barrels of oil while producing about 453 million barrels of crude oil, he said. A standard barrel of crude oil contains 42 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gallons. `` To say no more oil development offshore is not reasonable, given the demand that this country has for oil,'' <PERSON> Fergus </PERSON> said. And so the arguments rage on, as they have for 20 years. In <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, GOO still exists -LRB- so does the goo _ several barrels a day of crude still bubble up from the ocean floor near the well that blew out in 1969. This seepage is not counted in the spill figures quoted by <PERSON> Fergus </PERSON>. -RRB- GOO did n't get the oil industry out, but the group claims it helped limit the growth of drilling and forced safety precautions that otherwise would not have been taken. In 1969, 10 oil platforms dotted the the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION>. Today there are 22, with applications pending for at least six more. Without citizen action, `` we suspect there would be two to three times as many platforms as there are now,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopps </PERSON>, president of GOO. The environmental movement has changed a lot in 20 years. `` A lot of our membership has died off, literally,'' <PERSON> Hopps </PERSON> said. But now, as then, the sight of an oily bird strikes something deep with the American conscience. Last weekend, 1,000 people reported to the <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION> bird hospital to ask if they were needed. `` We all use oil,'' said volunteer <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, still clutching the oil-soaked bird. `` I guess we have to pay the price for it.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has taken under advisement a <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> decision to classify imported sport utility vehicles like the <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Samurai </ORGANIZATION>, and most small vans as trucks, subjecting them to duty rates 10 times higher than those for cars, an agency spokesman said Thursday night. The spokesman, who requested anonymity, said the department decided Thursday to review the ruling, will assess the case and make a legal decision. Last week, Deputy Customs Commissioner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said that in the past, these vehicles sometimes had been classified as cars, upon which a 2.5 percent duty is imposed, and at other times as trucks, subject to a 25 percent duty. The deciding factor often was whether the vehicles were fitted with back seats and other amenities. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said auto industry officials have estimated the ruling could affect 100,000 to 250,000 or more vehicles, many of which would be switched from the car to truck category and could net the government hundred of millions of dollars in higher tariffs.

 <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, trying to cleanse its dirtied image from the Wall Street insider trading scandal, has offered top jobs to two ex-chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, including the one who first authorized a probe that led to the financial giant's current problems. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shad </PERSON>, who headed the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> from 1981 to 1987 and now is envoy to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, confirmed Thursday through a spokesman at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy there that he had been approached by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> about becoming chairman, but he did not say whether he would accept. The nation's fifth-largest securities firm also asked another ex-SEC chairman, <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, husband of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative-designate <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, about the possibility of serving on its board of directors. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, who ran the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> from 1975-77 and is now an independent trade consultant in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, also confirmed <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> had approached him but declined to comment further. It was under <PERSON> Shad </PERSON>'s auspices that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> began a major investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> in late 1986, which resulted in a massive civil enforcement action in September and a record securities-fraud plea deal between the firm and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, reached last month but still not finalized. <PERSON> Shad </PERSON> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> probe after the firm was implicated in extensive wrongdoing by <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the speculator and inside trader now serving a three-year prison term. `` The firm's objective is to develop a fresh outlook on the problems and opportunities it faces, and to continue to make an important contribution to the nation's capital markets,'' <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> said in a brief statement Thursday disclosing the job offers to Shad and <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>. `` The firm continues to enjoy the loyalty and support of the vast majority of its employees, and investment banking, institutional and retail clients. After the settlement, the firm's $ 2 billion of capital will remain among the largest in the securities industry and will be more than adequate to finance its future growth,'' the statement said. The invitations extended by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> were disclosed as the firm continued to negotiate with the government over final details of its securities fraud plea bargain settlement. Under that accord, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> must pay a record $ 650 million in fines and restitution, plead guilty to six unspecified felonies, settle related civil litigation with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and agree to cooperate in the government's expanding campaign against Wall Street corruption. Shad is credited with toughening the agency's enforcement efforts to reduce insider trading and other abuses on Wall Street, and is a leading proponent of strengthening business ethics in general. Independently wealthy, with an extensive background on Wall Street, <PERSON> Shad </PERSON> resigned the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> post in 1987 after a six-year tenure to accept the ambassador position. If Shad were to accept a <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> job, he would replace <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Linton </PERSON>, who has long been expected to retire. It would mark an ironic twist not only in the legal ordeal of the investment firm but also for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, who was once hired by <PERSON> Shad </PERSON> 20 years ago when <PERSON> Shad </PERSON> ran the now-defunct investment firm <ORGANIZATION> E.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Trade Group Announces Plans For Advanced Television</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sixteen <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics companies have agreed to study the feasibility of creating a corporate partnership that would develop the next generation of televisions, a trade group says. The partnership would be a potentially profit-making organization that would work with the federal government on research leading to the manufacture of high-definition TV sets, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The partnership might even do its own manufacturing of components, such as picture tubes, spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. The trade group argues that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not afford to be left behind by the Japanese in the next generation of bright, sharp televisions, which will be packed with sophisticated electronics. `` Given the unlikelihood of an individual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company risking entering this evolving new market, the action is a logical and practical next step for the industry,'' <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, the group's vice president for science and technology policy, said in a statement. Some analysts have expressed skepticism about the potential for success of such a partnership, and some of the companies that agreed to do the feasibility study said they were not necessarily committed to participating in a partnership. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the last major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television manufacturer, said, `` In terms of overall support, we rate this as third or fourth in importance.'' Acknowledging the obstacles, Ms. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> said in an interview, `` There's not been a soul who's encouraged me personally or <ORGANIZATION> AEA </ORGANIZATION> in general on doing this. There's been nothing but nay-sayers.'' Asked if she was optimistic about the chances for a partnership, she said, `` Optimistic is too elevated a word. This is a logical next step.'' Companies funding development of a business plan for the proposed venture are <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Varian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cohu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Prometrix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PCO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tektronix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Raychem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> AVX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>.

The company valued the pledge to buy <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> power at $ 750 million, making the total deal worth nearly $ 2 billion. <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION> has said about 10 companies have expressed interest in acquiring all or part of the utility, including <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>; a pairing of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said officials would not comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> proposal before reviewing it in detail. Comment was not immediately obtained from any other possible bidders. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>, a $ 5.8 billion, 1,150-megawatt plant finished in 1986, remains idle for lack of a federal operating license. <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION> went into reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code last year after state courts refused to allow the utility to pass on the costs of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> to ratepayers. <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION> is the biggest stakeholder in <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> owns 4 percent of the plant. <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION>, its creditors and the state are negotiating a financial restructuring of the utility, but the talks have been punctuated by harsh rhetoric and charges of bad faith. In his statement Thursday, <PERSON> Duffet </PERSON> criticized state officials for failing to recognize a value anywhere near the range proposed by Northeast Utilities. Northeast Utilities officials said their proposed buyout would provide <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION> with an opportunity to speedily resolve virtually all outstanding issues in the reorganization. Northeast Utilities President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said the state and <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION> are `` now far apart on reaching a settlement,'' with the utility wanting more money to settle up with creditors and the state refusing to agree to the high rates being proposed by creditors. `` We firmly believe we can be the catalyst ... to bring ratepayers and creditors together,'' <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION> to incorporate the proposal into its own bankruptcy reorganization plan. If <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION> declines, <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> will press its case with <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> officials, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said. Northeast Utilities, based in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, serves more than 1 million customers in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and 185,000 customers in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> through subsidiaries, the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The company's electricity sales in the past year were more than $ 2 billion, compared with <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION>'s sales of under $ 600 million. The Northeast Utilities offer provides more money than had been previously available for stockholders and creditors, and protects <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION>'s ratepayers from huge increases. Under the proposal, first-mortgage and general and refunding mortgage bondholders _ who have been receiving interest since <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy _ would recover their full principal, about $ 440 million, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said. Third-mortgage bondholders would receive all of their principal _ just over $ 400 million _ but substantially less than the total interest that has accrued. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a substantial third-mortgage bondholders group, said Thursday it was too early to comment on the proposal. However, he said his group's position has been `` that as secured creditors you deserve 100 percent of capital and accrued interest.'' The unsecured creditors who would hold the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> assets would receive about $ 70 million in cash from <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> and $ 75 million in preferred stock from the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> would also pay them $ 165 million to pay for <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> until it wins an operating license.

<HEAD>Federal Official Traces S&amp;L Crisis to ``New Breed'' of Owners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES O. CLIFFORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal official investigating more than $ 220 million in losses from alleged fraud at savings and loans says much of the crisis in the nation's thrifts can be traced to a `` new breed of owner.'' `` Often they were real estate developers'' who took over a small thrift, a move that `` provided them with a ready source of cash to fund their projects,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cirona </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION>, said in testimony to be given today to a congressional committee. <PERSON> Cirona </PERSON> was appearing for a second day before members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at a hearing into the troubled thrift industry, which saw a post-Depression record 217 insolvent institutions last year. On Thursday, <PERSON> Cirona </PERSON>, whose district includes <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, delivered a half-inch thick statement that said since August of 1987 his investigators had referred 5,384 cases of possible fraud or abuse to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office. Many of the cases `` involve rather small amounts obtained fraudulently by borrowers or depositors,'' he said. `` However, we are particularly concerned by abuse by insiders which may often involve very large sums of money. For this reason we have established a special system of ` priority referrals' that involves insiders or amounts in excess of $ 100,000. `` We estimate that losses ... on these priority referrals, as of Sept. 23, 1988, amounted to over $ 220 million.'' The new breed of savings and loan owner, who entered the field following deregulation in 1982, could find an `` auditor that would allow a thrift to guarantee a profit by investing in acquisition, developments and construction loans,'' <PERSON> Cirona </PERSON> said in today's prepared testimony Others testifying on Thursday included <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a successful <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> thrift that <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> said deals only in residential loans. He said the savings and loan crisis was `` the greatest financial scandal in history in which in excess of $ 100 billion has been wasted and lost.'' The problems could have been avoided if the `` fundamentals of the thrift industry'' _ dealing only in residential loans _ had been followed, he said. <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> called efforts at deregulation of the industry bungled and that regulators had been repeatedly warned. `` I could tell you stories that would make your hair curl,'' he said, bringing laughter from the nearly-packed hearing room and from committee chairman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, who ran his hand over his bald pate. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, earlier told his own horror stories of failed thrifts, recalling a couple who lost $ 50,000 saved for their children's education. `` It would tear your heart out'' to hear such stories, said <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> called for a full analysis of the crisis in the savings and loans institutions where government bailouts exceeded $ 38 billion in 1988 alone. The hearing was needed to `` clean up the mess that is already out there,'' he said, adding that more hearings would be held in other cities.

<HEAD>Plans to End Merger Pact, Sell Oster-Sunbeam to Black &amp; Decker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has asked a federal bankruptcy judge for permission to sell its <ORGANIZATION> keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oster-Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION> division to <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Decker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as part of a plan management will devise to reorganize the troubled consumer products company. Creditors, however, asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosetti </PERSON> Thursday for permission to file their own plan to reorganize <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which has been operating under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code for nearly a year. At a hearing before <PERSON> Cosetti </PERSON>, unsecured creditors lashed out at management for the rejection Wednesday of a merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>. `` This debtor is inept. It has no credibility,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sable </PERSON>, representing <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s unsecured creditors. Lawyers representing unsecured creditors literally stood in line to tell Cosetti they had no faith in the <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> board's ability to find an acceptable reorganization plan. <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> asked Cosetti to allow the firm to sell <PERSON> Oster-Sunbeam </PERSON>, a maker of irons, shavers and other small appliances, to <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Decker for $ 260 million. In conjunction with that proposal, management said it has entered an agreement under which its recent adversary, Spear, <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kellog </PERSON>, would help finance the management reorganization plan. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm had been battling the board as head of a shareholders' committee The board rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> deal because the securities firm struck a private bargain with a rival bidder, the <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> banker group, to carve up the company between them. <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> planned to sell the lawn furniture and gas grill business to <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> for $ 250 million and keep the rest of the company, including the <ORGANIZATION> Oster-Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION> division. The board also objected to <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> altering its takeover proposal by lowering its common equity contribution to the reorganized company by $ 30 million. <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it would ask the bankruptcy court for sanctions against <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> and the Levy group. The board announced a tentative merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> last November after the major creditor groups scuttled an earlier management reorganization plan and forced the board to offer the company for sale. Cosetti deferred ruling on any of the requests. He had set Thursday as a deadline for management to choose among the bidders' reorganization plans Management's sole right to submit a plan expires today. It was not immediately clear what anti-trust considerations might be raised by the merger of the <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam-Oster </ORGANIZATION> division and <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> would use the proceeds of the <LOCATION> Oster-Sunbeam </LOCATION> sale to reduce debt and emerge with a company with about $ 500 million in annual sales from its remaining businesses, which include gas grills, lawn furniture, weather instruments, electric blankets and scales. Black & amp; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Towson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, manufactures and sells power tools, accessories, household appliances and lawn care equipment.

<HEAD>Technology's Effect On Economy Felt In Poorer Countries: Greenspan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> says the technological advances that have spurred changes in the world economy this decade are starting to be felt in poorer nations. Some heavily indebted nations _ for example, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> _ are beginning to show signs of economic vitality, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said late Thursday in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION>. `` We obviously still have very significant problems with the debtor nations and their economic structure.'' But <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the nations are going through profound changes that make him optimistic that economic improvement may be forthcoming. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said that technological advances, which have `` downsized'' the goods produced by industrial nations and vastly improved communications, have put pressure on governments to open up their societies and economies. He said that `` perestroika,'' the name for Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reform program, is a worldwide phenomenon and is evidence that centrally controlled economies as part of oppressive government leadership are becoming a thing of the past. `` If we could resolve the debt problem, which we're beginning to get some handle on, then I think we're going to find a really major renewal of economic capabilities in a number of these countries which have been under such terribly difficult pressure in recent years,'' he said.

<HEAD>Government Plans To Expand Imports To Hold Down Trade Surplus</HEAD>

 The South Korean government has promised to expand its imports whenever the country's current account trade surplus exceeds quarterly targerts. Government officials said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was mostly likely to benefit from the plan, which was contained in an annual economic report presented to President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo Thursday. <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was estimated at around $ 9 billion last year, down from nearly $ 10 billion in 1987. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s biggest market, taking about 35 percent of Korean exports which totaled $ 60.6 billion last year. The government said it will set up special task forces to remove various non-tariff barriers and prepare a schedule for opening the market for farm products.

<HEAD>Six Board Of Trade Members Get Fines, Suspensions In Wig Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Six traders have been suspended from conducting transactions at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and fined thousands of dollars each for engaging in fraudulent practices. CBOT disciplinary authorities found all six had engaged in a scheme involving a trader who wore a wig and fake identification to conduct transactions, CBOT officials announced Thursday. The traders were linked through federal court testimony last summer to the wig scheme masterminded by veteran trader <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, who was sentenced in November to six years in prison. The disciplinary action, imposed Dec. 16 but announced this week, followed revelations by prosecutors in the Sanders probe. The suspensions ranged from 15 days to 10 years and fines were between $ 5,000 and $ 50,000 each. Investigators found all six engaged in `` fraud and dishonorable and dishonest conduct'' and `` reckless and unbusinesslike dealings inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.'' <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, 45, was found guilty of setting up the scheme in which <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>, another former trader, donned a wig and used stolen trader badges and jackets to gain access to a restricted area near the Treasury Bond trading pit. The government claimed that because of the disguises, <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> and others in the scheme were able to claim $ 30,000 in trading profits without detection. <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> was sentenced to five years in prison. The six suspended traders were identified as <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schremser </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bratta </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinkade </PERSON>. Schremser and <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> testified under grants of immunity from prosecutors at <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' trial, the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> said. The CBOT board of governors levied the stiffest penalty against <PERSON> Bremner </PERSON>, who was suspended for 10 years, fined $ 50,000 and barred from associating with other members of the exchange during the suspension.

 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> has given a cool response to a proposal made by a group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen to set up a bilateral panel to arbitrate trade disputes between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s External Relations Commissioner <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON>, said Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> was `` reluctant'' about the plan. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> was more interested in strengthening the procedures of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, the Geneva-based international trade body which normally arbitrates in trade disputes, he said. The spokesman, who asked not to be named, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen had discussed the issue with <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> on Thursday in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. He said that the congressmen suggested the panel could arbitrate in what they called `` relatively minor'' disputes such as the current quarrel about the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s ban on hormones in beef. In retaliation for the ban, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed 100 percent tariffs affecting $ 100 million worth of trade in <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> goods.

 The stock market was mixed today, faced with news of a smaller-than-expected rise in retail sales last month. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped .53 to 2,221.79 in the first half hour of trading. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 569 up, 344 down and 518 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 21.60 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that retail sales increased 0.2 percent in December, a gain much smaller than most analysts had estimated. Stock traders seemed uncertain at first how to respond to the news. In the bond market, investors reacted positively, sending interest rates lower on the report's suggestion that economic activity was a bit less robust than had been thought. But the dollar declined in foreign exchange after the figures were made public. Brokers said blue-chip stocks also were faced with some selling to cash in on the gains that have recently carried the market to its highest levels since the October 1987 crash. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> was up -RRB- at 31 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> held steady at 45, and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> dropped \ to 122 ~ The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose .23 to 159.49.

<TEXT>
 The first `` barometer'' of 1989 has already flashed a positive signal for the stock market. In the first five sessions of the year, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials posted a net gain of 30.89 points. That marks the 24th time in the past 40 years that the market gained ground in the first trading week, according to <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirsch </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tappan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> investment advisor. On only two of those occasions, in 1966 and 1973, did the market fail to finish the year in the plus column. <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> describes the first-week performance as an `` early warning'' system for his popular January barometer, which is based on the premise that `` as January goes, so goes the year'' in the market. In his annual Stock Trader's Almanac, <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> says the direction stock prices take in January has foreshadowed the full year's outcome correctly all but three times since 1950 This time of year is a peak period for the various indicators people have adopted to try to solve the perpetual riddle of the market outlook. When the Super Bowl is played in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Jan. 22, many Wall Streeters will be rooting, at least tongue-in-cheek, for the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> 49ers to beat the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bengals </ORGANIZATION>. That's because the 49ers trace their origins to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> before its merger with the former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. In the 22 years that the Super Bowl has been played, a victory by a team from the original <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> has always been followed by an up year for stock prices. Sober, right-thinking Wall Streeters try not to take the Super Bowl indicator too seriously. It simply is n't fitting for people with fiduciary responsibilities to be associating themselves with anything so patently frivolous. Still, the Super Bowl indicator gets a lot of attention, if only as an entertaining diversion from the rigors of a demanding business. <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> argues that there is considerably more logic to the January barometer. `` Several events have been squeezed into January which affect our economy and our stock markets, and quite possibly those of many nations of the world,'' he observes. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convenes, the president presents his budget and his State of the Union message, and `` national goals and priorities'' are set. `` Switch these events to any other month and chances are the January barometer would become a memory,'' he concludes. That case fails to sway some skeptics, however, who question the utility if not the validity of the January barometer. In 1987, for example, the market rose 13.2 percent in January. Thanks to the crash that fall, stocks finished the year with a gain of just 2 percent. So while the barometer's performance that year was technically a correct call, prices actually were lower at yearend than they had been 11 months earlier. If you had tried to act on the January barometer as soon as its signal was known, in other words, chances are you would have lost money. Even worse yet, from the viewpoint of many professional money managers, the January barometer failed to alert investors in 1982 to the impending start of a mighty bull market. Stocks fell 1.8 percent in January of that year. With an upsurge that started in August, they closed out the year with a net gain of 14.8 percent.

 The government today predicted that unemployment would rise from 2 percent to 3 percent as a result of an austerity plan designed to cut the economy's growth rate and reduce inflation. The announcement, the first of its kind, came as the government is struggling to cool an overheated economy that has boosted prices to record-high levels. People ran on banks last summer to take out their money and buy as much as possible before prices went higher still. `` The austerity measures will leave many people jobless,'' said <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wu </PERSON>, spokeman for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, or cabinet. `` The most seriously affected will be those in the construction industry, because it is those projects that we want to stop.'' He said the government hopes to cut inflation by 3 percent to 5 percent next year. He said anything lower would stifle economic developement. Yuan said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has an 18.5 percent rate of inflation, but some Chinese economists privately put it at about 40 percent. In a news conference summing up last year's economy, <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s gross national product in 1988 grew by 11.2 percent over 1987 to $ 368 billion. Industrial output led the surge, jumping by 17.7 percent. However, agriculture increased a disappointing 3 percent. Yuan said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> hopes to cut its gross national product to a 7.5 percent rate of growth this year. Under the plan, industrial production will fall to 8 percent growth and farm output will rise 4 percent. He said unemployment in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was 2 percent and expected to rise 50 percent to 3 percent this year because of the government's austerity program Estimates by independent economists put the jobless figure much higher. The government imposed the austerity program in September to put the brakes on the price spiral that has eroded the standard of living for up to a fifth of city dwellers. A reform program designed to allow prices to float on the market was cut back severely. Under the austerity program, more than 10,000 projects have also been stopped, reducing investment by $ 9 billion, <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> said. He said the government would move to cushion unemployment by guaranteeing the jobless a certain standard of living. He did not give details. Although most areas of the economy will be cut, the state will put more money into agriculture, <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will increase its farm investment by $ 100 million, <ORGANIZATION> Yuan </ORGANIZATION> said. He said the austerity program has already slowed the growth of prices. In December, prices went up 26 percent over the same month the previous year. But, <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> said the rate of increase was 0.8 percent less than in November. Bank deposits, another signal of economic activity, are again on the increase, he said. One of the reasons for the increase, however, is that many banks have frozen the assets of individually - and collectively-owned businesses Yuan also said a crackdown on corruption has returned $ 2.1 billion in embezzled funds to the state. More than 150 high-ranking officials from national companies have resigned and more than 30 big companies closed because of corruption inquiries, he said.

 The landmark 1986 overhaul of the federal income tax, which was widely advertised as having no effect on the budget deficit, actually will worsen the red ink by almost $ 91 billion over a five-year period, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration now estimates. The 1990 budget that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Monday projects the new tax law will add $ 24.4 billion to the deficit this fiscal year and $ 20.3 billion in the year that begins Oct. 1. It resulted in an $ 8.9 billion loss in 1988. A <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> specialist this week disputed the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> calculations. <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION>'s figures, which are expected in a few days, will show a far smaller revenue loss over five years. The official said <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION>'s estimates are supported by the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION>, which advises <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on tax matters. `` In 1992 and 1993, we believe the new law will increase collections by between $ 5 billion and $ 10 billion a year,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> official, who would not be quoted by name. `` Looking even further into the future, it's going to be revenue-neutral,'' meaning it will produce the same revenue that the old law would have in those years, the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> source said. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offered no official explanation of why its new estimates differ so widely from earlier calculations. However, one <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> aide suggested the problem is that the new estimates have no way of accounting for higher incomes that many economists think resulted from the lower tax rates under the new law. This explanation is based on the concept that underlies <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s economic policies: that cutting tax rates induces people to work hard, earn more and save more Those higher incomes, in turn, would produce more revenue for the government. During the nearly two years it took <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to write the law, leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and administration always agreed on one point: no matter what went into the new tax package, the total result should neither raise nor lower total government tax collections. On several occasions, lawmakers had to amend their work because revenue experts indicated it would have lost money, Shortly after the law was enacted, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimated that in the five budget years from 1987 through 1991, it would produce $ 300 million less in total revenue than the old law would have _ a figure low enough to be considered revenue-neutral. But a year ago, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget indicated that loss would be $ 23.2 billion. The new budget more than doubles the loss or the same five years to $ 48.5 billion. It projects a $ 90.9 billion loss for the five years from 1988 through 1992. When <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the new law, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration agreed the measure would increase tax collections by $ 11.5 billion in 1987, chiefly because owners of stocks and other investments would be induced to sell some assets in the closing days of 1986 to avoid a higher tax on capital gains that began in 1987. In fact, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says, 1987 collections rose by $ 21.5 billion. Congress and the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> often have found it is next to impossible to project how changes in tax laws will affect taxpayer behavior _ and thus revenue collections _ more than a year or two into the future. The problem with the 1986 law is even greater, because it included the most changes since the income tax was enacted in 1913. In addition to cutting tax rates significantly for individuals and corporations, the law reduced or repealed several deductions and credits and aimed to shift $ 120 billion of the tax burden from individuals to businesses over five years. The <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> official said whatever shortage in revenue results from the new law will have been caused by overestimating taxes to be gained by reducing individual deductions, rather than from the rate reduction.

 The stock market turned downward today, faced with news of a smaller-than-expected rise in retail sales last month. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had climbed 15.89 points Thursday, slipped 5.71 to 2,216.61 by 11 a.m. today. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 519 up, 617 down and 563 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 45.41 million shares at midmorning. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that retail sales increased 0.2 percent in December, a gain much smaller than most analysts had estimated. Stock traders seemed uncertain at first how to respond to the news. In the bond market, investors reacted positively, sending interest rates lower on the report's suggestion that economic activity was a bit less robust than had been thought. But the dollar declined in foreign exchange after the figures were made public.

 Grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid reports of a Soviet bid for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat and drought damage to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s soybean crop. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was said to be bidding for more of the wheat it has been offered at prices subsidized by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, analysts said. An Argentine government report showing the first signs of damage to that country's soybean crop gave the soybean market a boost, analysts said. `` <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> is extremely hot and dry,'' said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 2 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.43 a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent to 1 \ cents higher with March at $ 2.87 \ a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 2 \ cents higher with March at $ 2.40 a bushel; soybeans were -RCB- cent to 3 -LCB- cents higher with January at $ 8.01 Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

 Wholesale prices, boosted by a 0.4 percent increase in December, rose 4 percent for all of 1988, the fastest pace since the nation began emerging from double-digit inflation near the beginning of the decade, the government said today. The gain in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index for finished goods, one stop short of the retail level, was nearly double last year's 2.2 percent increase. It was the biggest gain since 1981, when costs jumped 7.1 percent. The index was propelled upward by a drought-induced 5.7 percent increase in food prices. They had showed no change in 1987. Meanwhile, energy prices, which had soared 11.2 percent in 1987, fell 3.4 percent in 1988. However, with the production agreement reached by the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations in November, analysts expect oil prices to head higher this year. All other finished goods in 1988 rose 4.3 percent. In December, food prices fell a slight seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent, energy costs edged up only 0.2 percent, but everything else jumped 0.6 percent, the biggest increase since September. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` inflation is running pretty much on the course its been on for several months.'' This is the third consecutive month of good news for grocery shoppers. Prices were unchanged in November after a 0.1 percent decline in October. However, that period of stability was preceded by seven consecutive months of increases from early spring through the summer. With the end of unseasonably moderate temperatures in many parts of the country in December, fuel oil soared 8.5 percent and natural gas rose 3.3 percent. Gasoline prices, however, fell 3.5 percent, holding back overall energy gains. For other items, a sharp 5.7 percent increase in tobacco prices and significant gains of 0.9 percent in automobile costs and 0.7 percent in women's clothing led the index. The fall in wholesale food costs was led by a 17.1 percent drop in turkey prices. Fresh and dried vegetable prices fell 8.5 percent; fresh fruit, 2.7 percent; fish, 1.3 percent, and pork, 0.3 percent. There was a gain of 3.0 percent for beef, 2.5 percent for chicken, and 1.0 percent for dairy products. The overall December increase left the Producer Price Index for finished goods at 110.0, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $ 100 in 1982 would have cost $ 110 last month, 30 cents more than in November. The increase was close to, or slightly higher than, what most economists expected in advance of the report. In November, the index rose 0.3 percent. It was unchanged in October. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his economic report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this week, listed the taming of inflation as one of his proudest economic achievements. However, 1988 marks the second consecutive year of accelerating inflation. Wholesale prices actually fell 2.3 percent in 1986. The administration is predicting a steady dampening of price increases through 1994, but most private economists forsee another modest acceleration this year. However, none expects a return to the days of 1979 and 1980, when wholesale prices surged 13 percent and 12 percent. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, anticipates no relief next year. He said tight labor markets and a squeeze on factory capacity will continue. The unemployment rate in December matched a 14-year low, while factories were straining in November at the highest operating rates in nine years.

 `` I'm expecting some further acceleration in prices particularly because the economy is so strong,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` I think we can say at best we had a slight breathing spell -LRB- in October and November -RRB- where we caught our breath after food prices were pushed up by the drought.'' Inflation at the consumer level, which also includes services and has in recent years run at a higher rate than wholesale price inflation, was 4.4 percent for the first 11 months of 1988, the same as the annual rate in 1987. But, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said, it's only a matter of time before pressures producing an acceleration in consumer prices rises. He predicted an inflation rate of 5 percent to 6 percent this year. `` You ca n't flout the laws of economics. The remarkable thing is we did n't had more acceleration last year,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is due to release its December index for consumer prices on Jan. 19.

 Bond prices rose in early trading today, boosted by a government report showing lower-than-expected December retail sales and by a stronger dollar. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond rose 13-16 point, or about $ 8.12 per $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 8.89 percent from 8.97 percent late Thursday. Retail sales were up 0.2 percent in December, less than the increase many analysts and economists had expected. The figure indicated that inflationary pressures may not be as great as believed; fear of inflation can lead to lower bond prices as investors flee the fixed-income market. The dollar also was up today in foreign-exchange trading despite reported sales of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency by central banks, providing further confidence for the bond market, analysts said. Another economic report released today, the December wholesale price index, was in line with the figure many experts expected, up 0.4 percent. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term government issues rose from -LRB- point to 7-16 point, intermediate maturities were up 9-16 point and long-term issues were up from -RCB- point to 27-32 point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 4.63 to 1,136.30. In corporate trading, industrials were up. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.57 to 295.81. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills fell to 8.50 percent as the discount fell 5 basis points to 8.22 percent. Yields on six-month bills fell to 8.82 percent as the discount fell 5 basis points to 8.34 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 9.00 percent as the discount fell 5 basis points to 8.33 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 91-16 percent, unchanged from late Thursday.

 <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s carefully nurtured image of a family-style company where life is lovely and finances are fine is a smoke screen hiding serious flaws, says a former company executive's new book. `` I have written this book to say that the ` emperor has no clothes,' to expunge the illusion that <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> is OK,'' <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> says in explaining the reasoning behind `` <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>: Debunking The Myth.'' `` Fact is Delta is not OK. Fact is Delta no longer deserves the reputation that it is financially impregnable and can endure and prosper in the worst of times. `` Fact is <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> is in need of strong medicine if it is to survive over the long term,'' writes <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a former vice president and assistant general counsel, who quit in 1979 after 13 years at the airline and now serves as general counsel for an airplane leasing company in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Industry analysts, however, see little to concern them at the Atlanta-based carrier, which generally enjoys a strong reputation on Wall Street and among the traveling public. `` No, I ca n't confess to be to worried about <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, an opinion echoed by <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Scully </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The book `` offers nothing constructive,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, who gave it his own title: `` Sour Grapes by <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>.'' `` I can see nothing to the current criticisms,'' <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said. `` I find his book laughable.

They just do n't fit today.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he left <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> in 1979 to become general counsel of <ORGANIZATION> Springs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. After nine years at the textile company, he returned to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to establish a consulting business which was bought by his current employer, <ORGANIZATION> Intercredit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> He says high salaries, lack of marketing expertise, a sub-par computer reservations system and failure to deal with airline deregulation have made <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> a company `` living on borrowed time.'' `` We're stable; we're financially healthy; we're growing,'' <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said. `` We're not setting the world on fire, but we're doing it the Delta way. `` The company has always been ultraconservative.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> offers a litany of problems at Delta: complaints that Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> has no grasp of marketing and is `` the wrong man at the wrong time;'' accusations that <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s budget process is non-existent; claims the airline has prospered by `` dumb luck;'' and suggestions its hiring-from-within process has perverted the company. He says the company has a `` siege mentality'' about criticism, and has no planning process. Among <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' solutions are for the company to more aggressively hire non-Delta employees, totally restructure its marketing department, get rid of its no-layoff policy and `` demonstrate financial stewardship.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> does n't expect his recommendations to be heard. `` The very problems I name and the solutions I pose will by my naming and proposing be immediately ruled out of any serious consideration of how to resolve <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s predicament,'' he writes. The book, which arrived in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> stores last week, has been greeted with a demand unusual for a business-oriented book, according to sales people at some local bookstores. `` It's moving more quickly than even we imagined,'' said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelb </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Peachtree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which printed 15,000 of the books initially. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> admits to keeping up with sales, but he says there has been little response coming to the airline. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said just-released figures show `` Delta for the 15th consecutive year got the lowest number of consumer complaints of the major airlines. Our passengers like us; if nobody else, our passengers like us.'' Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third largest airline, reported an 11.3 percent increase in revenue passenger miles in 1988 and said the actual number of passengers rose 7.1 percent to almost 60 million.

 The Big Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers got 1989 off on an upbeat note, selling 3.7 percent more U.S.-built cars and light trucks in early January than they did during the same period last year, the companies said Friday. A 20.4 percent gain in light truck sales by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was diluted by a 5.5 percent decrease in car sales overall, prompted by a 19.8 percent decline in sales of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> cars. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> showed increases of 13 percent and 11.4 percent, respectively, in car sales. The Big Three said they sold cars and light trucks at a daily rate of 24,393 during the Jan. 1-10 period this year, compared with a rate of 23,534 during the same time last year. There were seven selling days in both periods. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said light trucks, including small pickups, minivans and sport-utility vehicles, were bought at a daily rate of 10,021 in early January this year, compared with a daily rate of 8,324 during the same time last year. On the car side, the Big Three reported early January sales at a rate of 14,372 in 1989, compared with 15,210 cars a day during the same period of 1988. Automakers had ambitious production schedules through the fourth-quarter of last year, indicating confidence in the early 1989 sales market. Incentives continued to be a factor and a new round of incentives appears near. On Wednesday, the day after the early-January sales period ended, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> returned to cut-rate financing as an option to cash-back financing. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> did not follow suit in the low-interest-rate game by noon Friday. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, the only member of the Big Three to show fewer car sales this year than in the first reporting period of 1988, said it sold cars at a daily rate of 6,801 during early January this year, compared with an 8,481 daily rate during the same time last year. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s truck sales rose 6.3 percent to a daily rate of 3,968 this year, compared with a 3,732 rate last year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s light truck sales showed a 46.9 percent increase in early January, climbing to a daily rate of 2,347 in 1989 from 1,598 during the period last year. Chrysler-made cars sold at a rate of 2,225 a day in early January this year, up 11.4 percent from the 13,985 daily rate of a year before. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said it sold trucks at a daily rate of 3,706 in early January, 23.8 percent more than the 2,993 early-January rate last year. Car sales at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> rose 13 percent, to a daily rate of 5,346 in early January this year from a 4,731 during the period last year.

 The government greatly expanded its role in protecting workers from hazardous materials Friday, setting exposure limits for 164 substances for the first time and tightening limits for 212 more in changes officials said could save 700 lives a year. `` This is a monumental job,'' Assistant Labor Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON> said in announcing the standards, which he said should significantly reduce the risk of illness to 21 million Americans who work in general industry and may be exposed to toxic or hazardous materials. About 4.5 million workers now face exposures above the new limits, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in completing a two-year project that represents the first large-scale changes to exposure standards in nearly two decades. Employers have until September to comply. `` We are literally taking a 20-year technological leap,'' said <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON>, head of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is the biggest action <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> has taken in its history.'' <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> estimated that in addition to preventing about 700 deaths a year, the tighter limits should prevent 55,000 illnesses and 500,000 lost workdays each year attributed to workplace exposure to hazardous and toxic materials. Rough estimates provided by the agency indicated the new standards could cut exposure-related deaths by one-fifth, illnesses and lost workdays by one-fourth. The reductions in maximum exposure limits cover some of the most commonly used industrial materials and byproducts, including acetone, carbon monoxide, carbon disulfide, chloroform, hydrogen cyanide, perchloroethylene and styrene. Substances regulated for the first time include wood dust and grain dust, acrylic acid, butane, gasoline, paraffin wax fumes, tungsten and welding fumes. Some substances are known or suspected carcinogens; others can have narcotic-like effects on humans. Still others are blamed for kidney, liver, heart and respiratory ailments while some are major skin and eye irritants. The limits cover the maximum amount of a substance a worker can be exposed to at any given time and during an eight-hour workday. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> said it needed to conduct further review before setting lmits for exposure to asphalt, fibrous glass dust and mineral wool. Those substances had been subject to new standards under the agency's draft regulations, but conflicting data presented during public hearings prompted <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> to delay final decisions. The changes announced Friday could cost employers on average $ 6,000 a year for each affected workplace, though that would vary greatly, the government said. Costs could range from $ 77,400 a year for petroleum refineries to $ 360 annually for auto dealers. The average per-worker cost is $ 150. The department considered limits for more than 400 industrial chemicals and substances in a single review, departing from a policy of case-by-case study that had produced new, comprehensive standards for just 24 substances in 17 years. After the review, the government decided to let stand existing limits on 52 substances. The new limits on the others take effect March 1 and employers must be in compliance by Sept. 1. Exposure limits will remain unchanged for 169 additional substances not covered by the two-year review. Some of them are currently being reviewed on an individual basis. The new standards apply only to general industry but will be extended, following additional proceedings, to construction and maritime industries as well. New limits were first suggested two years ago. A draft was released last summer followed by 13 public hearings and a public comment period during which more than 90 companies, trade associations and labor unions testified and submitted documents for <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> to consider. The new federal guidelines will require 23 states and the territories of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> to check OSHA-approved local standards they have adopted to make sure they meet the new regulations. Those states are: <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. Affected to a lesser extent are <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which have state exposure standards for local government employees.

 Mexican oil prices rose an average of more than $ 2 a barrel in December in the wake of the new <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> quota agreement, the government oil monopoly <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> said. The price of light Isthmus crude in the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> was $ 13.93 a barrel in December, an increase from $ 11.62 in November, <ORGANIZATION> Petroleos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexicanos </ORGANIZATION> said late Thursday. The heavy Maya grade sold for $ 10.52 a barrel, compared with $ 9.21 a month earlier, and the extra-light Olmeca for $ 15.24, up from $ 12.90. Customers in the Far East paid $ 12.95 a barrel for Isthmus and $ 10.30 a barrel for Maya, increases from $ 10.82 and $ 8.22 a barrel respectively. Prices for European buyers during the first half of the month averaged $ 14.39 for Isthmus and $ 11.09 for Maya, up from $ 12.79 and $ 9.71. <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> said the increases were the result of `` the significant recovery in prices of the principal crudes sold on the international petroleum market'' following the agreement Nov. 28 by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> Exporting Countries. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s 13 members agreed to lower their output by nearly 4 million barrels a day, to 18.5 million barrels in an effort to stem the flow of excess oil and reverse the decline of world oil prices. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is not a member of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Close On High Note</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

 Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly higher Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in subdued activity ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s eagerly awaited first crop report of the new year. Soybean futures posted the strongest gains on rumors the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was in the market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean meal. But overall, `` today was really a dull day,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The crop report, which was released at 3 p.m. EST in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, contained the government's final 1988 crop production figures, a hotly anticipated tally of 1989 winter-wheat seedings, and estimates of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain stockpiles. The winter-wheat seedings figure came in at 54.46 million acres, well below the average pre-report estimate of 57.59 million acres and 12 percent above the 1988 seeding figure. Analysts called the number bullish for the wheat futures market. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said 1988 soybean production totaled 1.54 billion bushels, 19.8 percent below the 1987 harvest but higher than most pre-report estimates and higher than the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s Nov. 9 projection of 1.51 billion bushels. Analysts called the number bearish for soybean futures. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said 1988 corn production totaled 4.92 billion bushels, 30.3 percent below the 1987 harvest but higher than most pre-report estimates and higher than the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s Nov. 9 projection of 4.67 billion bushels. Analysts termed the number bearish for corn futures. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> pegged soybean stocks as of Dec. 1 at 1.37 billion bushels, corn stocks at 7.07 billion bushels and wheat stocks at 1.71 billion bushels. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> will project 1989 corn and soybean acreage on March 31. At the close of trading, wheat was 1 \ cents lower to -RCB- cent higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.41 a bushel; corn was 2 -LCB- cents to 3 cents higher with March at $ 2.88 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 4 \ cents to 5 cents higher with March at $ 2.43 a bushel; soybeans were -LCB- cent to 6 -LCB- cents higher with January at $ 8.03 -LCB- cents a

The accord, signed in November, reduced <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s oil production by 4 million barrels to 18.5 million barrels a day starting Jan. 1 and extending for six months. `` He will be discussing petroleum, international cooperation, South-South relations, and of course the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- summit,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> press spokesman Pastor <PERSON> Heydra </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> is scheduled to meet with <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> on Sunday in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> before leaving for <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> on a visit to promote bilateral cooperation and trade. He will stop in <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> before moving on to <LOCATION> Teheran </LOCATION> next Tuesday and <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> last December to drum up support for the summit. Arab members of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> have been cool to the idea. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> has expressed support for a summit in 1990, the year of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s 30th anniversary. The cartel's 20th anniversary summit, scheduled for 1980 in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, was canceled because of the Gulf war. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> is also promoting a summit of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations to pressure for better conditions to repay the region's foreign debt of over $ 400 billion. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>' inauguration ceremony Feb. 2 will be attended by 21 heads of state, including <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. Unofficially, several <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers, including <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON>, may also attend, Venezuelan officials said.

 The stock market pieced together a small gain today, faced with word of a smaller-than-expected gain in retail sales last month. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that retail sales increased 0.2 percent in December, a gain much smaller than most analysts had estimated. Stock traders seemed uncertain at first how to respond to the news. In the bond market, investors reacted positively, sending interest rates lower on the report's suggestion that economic activity was a bit less robust than had been thought. But the dollar declined in foreign exchange after the figures were made public. Brokers said blue-chip stocks also were faced with some selling to cash in on the gains that have recently carried the market to its highest levels since the October 1987 crash.

<TEXT>
 Congressional analysts on Friday disputed the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's projection that the 1986 tax overhaul _ which was supposed to have no effect on the federal deficit _ will actually worsen the red ink by nearly $ 91 billion over five years. Nevertheless, the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> did acknowledge its own forecasts show that rather than being `` revenue neutral'' the sweeping law will lose $ 23.4 billion during the same five-year period ending in 1992. Comparing other time periods shows a similar disagreement between the administration's tax experts in the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and those of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, who work for the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and the Joint Committee on Taxation. The argument means nothing as far as reducing the deficit is concerned, since the revenue figures are already built into the president's budget. However, the disagreement is likely to make government officials and the public think twice the next time they hear anyone attempt to estimate tax revenues far into the future. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget director, said he did not expect the size of the revenue losses to be anywhere near the levels being estimated in the president's formal budget. `` This is a static analysis done by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that does not take into account any other influences on the economy. It needs to be taken with a grain of salt,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. He said the analysis failed to take into account faster economic growth that the administration contends is likely to occur in response to the reduction in tax rates. Shortly after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the 1986 law, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION> estimated it would be essentially revenue neutral _ lose only $ 300 million _ from 1987 through 1991. They forecast a sizable revenue increase in 1987, because taxpayers would act to avoid a scheduled rise in the tax on capital gains; losses in 1988 and 1989, and then increases into the future. At this time a year ago, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed a budget that forecast a $ 23-billion drop in collections during the same five years. The budget that came out this week more than doubles that projected decline, to $ 48.5 billion for the period, and increases it to $ 90.9 billion for the 1988-92 period. In contrast, <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> says that because of the big 1987 boost, the law will increase collections by $ 4.6 billion in the 1987-1991 period, though it will result in an overall loss for the 1988-92 period. The administration's latest forecast was included in the fiscal 1990 budget that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. During that 12-month period beginning Oct. 1, revenue will be $ 20.3 billion less than under the old law, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> says. <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> forecast a drop of only $ 700 million. <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> expects the new law to produce more revenue each year than the old law starting in 1991 while the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates continued declines, at least through 1993. It was a different story in 1985 and 1986 when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration were putting the new law together. Democrats wanted to ensure the overhauled law did not worsen the treasury drain that they blmed principally on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1981 across-the-board tax cut. Republicans were fighting any revenue increase, on grounds more taxes would simply lead to more spending. The solution was to aim for a tax bill that was revenue neutral _ that left the government with essentially the same money that the old law would have provided. But, as the new figures seem to indicate, there is simply no way to forecast how taxpayers will react to changes in the tax law three or more years in the future. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., then chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a prime author of the new law, recognized the difficulty of such forecasts On the day the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed the final version of the bill, <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> declared: `` We have done everything we can to write it so that it will be revenue neutral. But, very frankly, when you are talking about a bill that goes over five years, and we're going to be collecting roughly $ 4.7 trillion over that five years, you could hope it is neutral. Nobody can be absolutely sure.'' Forecasting tax revenues was made ever more difficult because the 1986 law included the most changes since the income tax was enacted in 1913. In addition to cutting tax rates significantly for individuals and corporations, the law reduced or repealed several deductions and credits and aimed to shift $ 120 billion of the tax burden from individuals to businesses over five years.

<TEXT>
 A `` Friday the 13th'' virus struck personal computers in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Friday in what experts said may have been a new manifestation of a computer virus that originated in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Hundreds of personal computer users found the virus was programmed to delete files on Friday the 13th, said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, managing director of S and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, a data recovery center in <LOCATION> Chesham </LOCATION>. `` It has been frisky and hundreds of people, including a large firm with over 400 computers, have telephoned with their problems,'' he said. Several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer-security experts said they had not received any reports that the virus had cropped up inside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The virus bore many of the characteristics of one that had been programmed to go off on Friday, May 13, 1988, the day before the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. That virus was first noticed at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and later spread to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Security experts said it was logical that a virus that was set to go off on one Friday the 13th would also go off on subsequent Friday the 13ths unless it was completely eradicated. This was the first Friday the 13th since the one in May 1988. `` It is just a pesky nuisance and is causing a lot of problems today,'' said <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, who also is chairman of an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> personal computer users group. The virus apparently attacked <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s MS-DOS, the software that runs the internal operations of the original line of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> personal computers and compatible models. There were no estimates of how widespread the damage from the virus was. The Israeli newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> said that in one case the original Israeli virus destroyed $ 15,000 worth of software and two disks in which 7,000 hours of work had been invested. The <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> virus, for some reason, possibly an error by its creator, began eating up space and slowing down computers before May 13, 1988. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said the latest virus also ate up room in computers and slowed them down before Friday. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, who did not want to be identified further, confirmed the virus had wiped out files in personal computers made by <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and compatible machines. The virus apparently did not affect personal computers in offices of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> itself, however, said <PERSON> Colette </PERSON> <PERSON> Abissi </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in Purchase, N.Y. The identity of the hacker who devised the virus might never be known, <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said. `` The important thing is not to panic and start trying to delete everything in a bid to remove the virus as that can do untold damage,'' he said. As long as master disks are free from the virus, files can simply be copied from them and used again, he said.

The decision to withdraw resulted from an assessment of the costs involved in the primary dealership, <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Continued expansion of the business would require the injection of substantial additional capital, but analysis of the prospective long-term return on capital has persuaded us that further investment can not be justified in the context of our overall strategy,'' <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. County <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> was named one of 46 primary dealers in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government securities on Sept. 29, the last time new primary dealers were added to the list by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>.

 U.S.-made car and truck sales rose 5.6 percent during early January this year compared with the same period last year, despite a 19.8 percent decline in car sales at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, automakers said Friday. The drop at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> may have been due to dealers moving some sales from early January to late December to inflate year-end numbers, analysts speculated. Strong truck sales helped bolster sagging automobile sales industrywide. The seven <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers said they sold cars and light trucks on a daily rate of 25,622 vehicles during the Jan. 1-10 period this year. During the same period last year, they sold cars and trucks at a daily rate of 24,252. There were seven selling days in both periods. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> was the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> maker to show a decline during the period, as its car sales skidded 19.8 percent, to a daily rate of 6,801 in early January this year compared with a rate of 8,481 during the same time last year. `` I think you're just seeing a payback from the end of December,'' said analyst <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` A few of the dealers probably called a few of the Jan. 3-4 sales Dec. 31 sales -LRB- to boost year-end figures -RRB-.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> agreed, saying: `` Their sales were unbelievably good in late December and unbelievably bad in early January. If you add the two periods together and divide by two, things are about normal. `` There was a lot of year-end window dressing in late December,'' <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> added. During the final 10-day period of December, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> reported a daily sales rate of 14,657 cars a day, more than twice the early January rate. Overall, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers said they sold cars at a daily rate of 15,283 during the first 10 days of the year, a 3.1 percent decline from a daily rate of 15,765 during the same time last year. Car sales for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> rose during early January, 13 percent and 11.4 percent, respectively. Light truck sales among all the makers rose 21.8 percent to a daily rate of 10,339 during early January this year compared with a rate of 8,488 last year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s light truck sales showed a 46.9 percent increase in early January, climbing to a daily rate of 2,347 in 1989 from 1,598 during the period last year. Chrysler-made cars sold at a rate of 2,225 a day in early January this year, up from 1,998 daily rate of a year before. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said it sold trucks at a daily rate of 3,706 in early January, 23.8 percent more than the 2,993 early-January rate last year. Car sales at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> rose to a daily rate of 5,346 in early January this year from a rate of 4,731 during the period last year. While its car sales rate fell, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s truck sales rose, going up 6.3 percent to a daily rate of 3,968 in early January of this year from a 3,732 truck-per-day rate during the same time last year.

 The stock market chalked up another gain Friday to set fresh new highs since the crash nearly 15 months ago. But the day's progress was small and tentative, coming on volume that lagged far behind Thursday's pace. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.75 to 2,226.07, finishing the week with a net gain of 31.78 points. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 836 up, 615 down and 540 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 132.32 million shares, down from 183 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 158.11 million shares. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that retail sales increased 0.2 percent in December, a gain much smaller than most analysts had estimated. Stock traders seemed uncertain at first how to respond to the news. In the bond market, investors reacted positively, sending interest rates lower on the report's suggestion that economic activity was a bit less robust than had been thought. But the dollar declined in foreign exchange after the figures were made public. Brokers said blue-chip stocks also were faced with some selling to cash in on the gains that have recently carried the market to its highest levels since the October 1987 crash. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> gained \ to 31 \; <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> rose -LCB- to 60 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> added -RRB- to 88; <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 52 ~, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> was down -LRB- at <PERSON> Smithkline </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON> led the active list, up -LRB- at 52 \ on turnover of more than 2.5 million shares A Wall Street Journal article discussed waning sales of <PERSON> Smithkline </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON>'s ulcer drug Tagamet and described the company as a takeover candidate. <ORGANIZATION> Abbott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> rose -RRB- to 47 | The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of 99 cents a share, against 84 cents in the like period a year earlier.

 The dollar surged to three-month highs against major currencies Friday as buyers shrugged off attempts by central banks to restrain its rise. Most of the dollar's gains occurred after midday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, when currency trading ceased in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the European central banks were no longer in the market selling dollars, traders said. There were reports of two rounds of intervention earlier in the day by the central banks of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. After the dollar had already achieved its gains for the day, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> by itself reportedly sold some dollars late in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading session. Traders were unintimidated by the central banks because it appeared the banks were merely trying to stall the dollar's rise, not drive the dollar down, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, senior yen dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government fears the dollar's rise because it could hurt the competitiveness of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods in world markets, worsening the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and others fear higher inflation if their currencies become too weak. The dollar closed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at its highest levels since October against the West German mark, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, French franc and Italian lira and at its highest level since November against the British pound. In spite of the seemingly sharp rise in the dollar, though, currency rates remain far more stable than they were earlier in the decade, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, a currency analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The dollar shot up until February 1985 and then immediately collapsed, losing half its value against the yen and the mark in little more than two years. Since then it has traded in a relatively narrow range. The dollar's rise Friday came in spite of news that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail sales increased by only 0.2 percent in December, while market forecasts had been for an increase of 1.4 percent. Higher sales could have signaled a hike in interest rates which would have made the dollar more attractive to investors. Instead, yields on <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds fell sharply. Also, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to report on the November merchandise trade deficit on Wednesday, and traders are usually reluctant to buy dollars heavily in advance of the report in case a big deficit hurts the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.7770 late Friday, more than one cent cheaper for buyers than Thursday's late $ 1.7880. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound weakened to $ 1.7660 from $ 1.7850. The dollar rose in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to close at 126.65 yen, up from 126.12 yen. Late Friday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar traded at 126.35 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 127.30 yen from 126.38 yen late Thursday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Thursday's late rates, included: 1.8445 West German marks, up from 1.8268; 1.5740 Swiss francs, up from 1.5559; 1.1978 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1972; 6.2850 French francs, up from 6.2280; and 1,352.6 Italian lire, up from 1,344 Other late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with Thursday's late rates, included: 1.8275 West German marks, down from 1.8355; 1.5715 Swiss francs, up from 1.5510; 6.2505 French francs, up from 6.2150; 2.0655 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0590; 1,346.50 Italian lire, up from 1,339.50; and 1.1982 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1957. Gold prices rose in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by more than $ 1 a troy ounce. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, where the day's trading begins, gold closed at $ 405.18 a troy ounce bid, down from $ 406.36. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the late bid gold price was $ 405.75 a troy ounce, up from $ 404.50. Gold also closed in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, at $ 405.75 bid, up from $ 404.20. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery fell to $ 402.30 a troy ounce from $ 404.50 on Thursday. Later, <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold bullion was bid at $ 402 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $ 404.20 on Thursday. Silver bullion traded late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at $ 5.96 bid a troy ounce, up from $ 5.95. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell to $ 5.888 a troy ounce from $ 5.916 on Thursday.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Advance On Chilean Refinery Blast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Copper futures prices rose sharply Friday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to reports of a disastrous explosion at the smelting operations of the world's largest copper mine near <LOCATION> Chuquicamata </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. On other markets, gold and silver futures retreated; coffee futures fell; grains and soybeans were mostly higher; energy, livestock and meat futures were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced. Copper settled 4.3 cents to 5.2 cents higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 1.431 a pound. The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s spot copper price settled at the day's high of $ 1.536 a pound The explosion of the flash furnace feeding <ORGANIZATION> Chilean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s Chuquicamata smelter was reported to have killed at least 16 people and could result in significant production losses, putting further strain on extremely tight copper supplies, analysts said `` The question of how much production loss will occur is not clear at all -LRB- but -RRB- any losses are very bullish because the market is so tight,'' said <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON>, a metal-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Production problems have plagued the worldwide copper industry in the past year, helping to drive the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s spot-month price to a record high of $ 1.6475 a pound on Dec. 8. A loss of production from <LOCATION> Chuquicamata </LOCATION> `` is not going to be a big supply problem in times to come but it will have an immediate short-term impact'' on prices, said analyst <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold and silver futures prices fell moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting gains in the dollar's value against major foreign currencies, analysts said. Gold settled $ 2.30 to $ 2.40 lower with February at $ 403.50 a troy ounce; silver was 2.8 cents lower across the board with March at $ 5.957 a troy ounce. Coffee futures ended lower in a second day of volatile activity on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Despite the decline, analysts said the market's bullish supply-and-demand fundamentals remained in place. Coffee settled 1.38 cents to 3.01 cents lower with March at $ 1.397 a pound. Grain and soybean futures ended mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> ahead of an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> crop report that was released after the close of trading and is expected to boost wheat prices, and pressure corn and soybean prices, on Monday. In the report, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimated 1989 winter-wheat seedings at 54.46 million acres, 12 percent above the 1988 tally but well below analysts' pre-report estimates. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said 1988 soybean production totaled 1.54 billion bushels, 19.8 percent below the 1987 harvest but higher than most pre-report estimates and higher than the agency's Nov. 9 projection of 1.51 billion bushels. The government said 1988 corn production totaled 4.92 billion bushels, 30.3 percent below the 1987 harvest but much higher than pre-report estimates and the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s Nov. 9 projection of 4.67 billion bushels. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> pegged soybean stocks as of Dec. 1 at 1.37 billion bushels, compared with 1.76 billion bushels a year earlier; corn stocks at 7.07 billion bushels, compared with 9.77 billion bushels a year earlier; and wheat stocks at 1.71 billion bushels, compared with 2.51 billion bushels a year earlier. The soybean number was slightly below expectations while the wheat and corn figures were higher than expected. The winter-wheat seedings figure alone would have been `` very bullish'' for the wheat market, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. But he said buying enthusiasm in the wheat market on Monday probably would be tempered by the bearish corn and and soybean production numbers and the bearish wheat and corn stocks figures. The corn numbers were `` a shockingly bearish surprise,'' <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said, and could translate into opening declines of more than 5 cents a bushel on Monday. Wheat settled 1 -LCB- cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with March at $ 4.41 a bushel; corn was 2 \ cents to 3 cents higher with March at $ 2.88 \ a bushel; oats were 4 \ cents to 5 \ cents higher with March at $ 2.43 a bushel; soybeans were 1 \ cents to 6 \ cents higher with January at In energy futures trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate crude oil settled 14 cents lower to 31 cents higher with February at $ 18.48 a barrel; heating oil was .33 cent lower to .31 cent higher with February at 52.95 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .52 cent to 1.20 cents higher with February at 49.97 cents a gallon. Livestock and meat futures finished narrowly mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .10 cent to .43 cent higher with February at 74.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent lower to .05 cent higher with January at 84.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent lower to .30 cent higher with February at 45.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .55 cent lower to .08 cent higher with February at 42.65 cents a pound. Stock-index futures advanced moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for March delivery of stocks represented by the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 1.05 points higher at 286.30.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said this week they plan to increase their capital spending levels for refining and marketing operations in 1989, while spending more exploration dollars overseas. The companies said their strategies to focus on `` downstream'' investment _ the businesses that refine and market chemicals, gasoline and other products _ were based on projections for weak oil prices into the 1990s. The downstream, or exploration and production, operations of most major oil companies have been hurt in recent years because of low oil prices. Despite a sharp rise in crude prices since November when the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> agreed to reduce its output, many analysts and oil company executives have remained skeptical that the gains would last beyond June, when the agreement expires. Several oil companies have said recently they would reduce domestic operations and concentrate on foreign exploration because it is cheaper and the potential for finding oil is greater. In 1988, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil production fell by an estimated 1 million barrels a day. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>, the fourth-largest oil company, said Friday it will spend $ 3.8 billion in 1989, $ 400 million more than in 1988, excluding its $ 2.5 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> oil and gas assets in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> said it would invest $ 350 million for chemical production, up 50 percent from last year, and $ 1.1 billion for refining, marketing and pipeline operations, 25 percent more than in 1988. The San Francisco-based company said its production budget would remain virtually unchanged at $ 2 billion, but with increased investments in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> said it would boost its capital spending 8 percent to $ 975 million, concentrating on refining operations and foreign exploration and production. The largest increase in the budget comes in the company's petroleum refining, marketing, petrochemicals and plastics business _ up from $ 330 million in 1988 to $ 389 million in 1989 The <LOCATION> Bartlesville </LOCATION>, Okla.-based company is expanding its manufacturing capacity in several plastics lines at its <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> chemical complex. Of the $ 406 million budgeted for worldwide exploration and production projects, $ 228 million is earmarked for overseas where the company said it sees strong potential for adding reserves in a low oil and gas price environment. The foreign exploration and production budget of $ 228 million is an increase from $ 159 million in 1988. Domestic exploration and production was budgeted at $ 178 million for the year, down from $ 241 million.

<TEXT>
 Soft drink giant <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s bottling business for $ 1.75 billion in cash, the companies announced Friday, two weeks after an earlier deal fell through. The previous deal, which carried a price tag of $ 1.5 billion, disintegrated after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> asked for additional details to determine whether it might violate antitrust laws. The delay prevented the sale from being completed in time for General Cinema to obtain tax deferral benefits. `` We're delighted that we reached a new agreement like this,'' said General Cinema spokesman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Nardone </PERSON>. He said the companies negotiated for the past two weeks and `` every time one of the parties walked away from the table, the other party came back, so it showed you that both parties really wanted this transaction to come to fruition.'' In trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> fell 75 cents a share to $ 38.75 a share while <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> rose 37 -LCB- cents a share to $ 24.37 -LCB-. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> said despite the higher price tag, the new deal wo n't actually cost <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> $ 250 million more because of offsetting reductions in financing costs and taxes. `` Comparing the net after-tax cost of <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> of the deal we signed today and the deal that we had hoped to do in 1988, the difference to <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> is only about $ 60 million more,'' <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> said. `` The reason for that is that this deal allows us lower effective financing costs and higher net tax benefits.'' `` You're talking about a 5 percent difference and the deal makes great sense for us both from a strategic standpoint and an operating standpoint,'' <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> said. Analysts have said the deal would bring one of the nation's biggest independent bottlers under <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION>'s control, allowing the Purchase, N.Y.-based company to consolidate bottling operations and reduce costs Under the new deal, General Cinema will not be able to defer $ 400 million in capital gains taxes over 20 years, because that provision expired Dec. 31, but <PERSON> Nardone </PERSON> said the advantage of having cash, which can be invested until the taxes are due, helps offset the loss. <PERSON> Nardone </PERSON> said the new cash deal is an improvement over the previous arrangement, which was for a 20-year <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> note. The companies said the revised deal is subject to signing a definitive agreement. The companies also said they do not anticipate any unusual delays in giving the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> the additional information it wants. <PERSON> Nardone </PERSON> said the deal means <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> will be pulling out of the bottling business, although it maintains an 18 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schweppes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. General Cinema, a film exhibition and soft-drink bottling concern based in <LOCATION> Chestnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, owns and operates 1,359 movie screens at 318 locations. The company also owns about 60 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Neiman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marcus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. General Cinema entered the bottling business in 1968 when it acquired <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which held <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> franchises in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. It subsequently purchased other franchises and has regional bottling facilities in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Twinsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The company's beverage unit had revenue of about $ 720 million for the fiscal year ending Oct. 31.

<HEAD>Sundstrand May Pay Nearly $100 Million To Settle New Claims, Magazine
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment Friday on a report that the aerospace contractor may pay the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nearly $ 100 million to settle questionable billing practices. Quoting unidentified sources, Business Week magazine said the Pentagon is preparing an administrative settlement in which <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> would make payments both in cash and contract-price guarantees to resolve the billing problem. `` We've made a standard practice not to comment on anything like that, which first of all we have n't seen and secondly it's an allegation on their part,'' <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernam </PERSON> said. The settlement would compound the effect of an unprecedented $ 127.3 million in fines levied against <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> late last year after the company pleaded guilty to overcharging the Pentagon on defense contracts. In its Jan. 23 issue, Business Week reported that the administrative claim alleges the company billed the government for millions of dollars in costs unrelated to its Pentagon contracts. Sources also told the magazine that current or former <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> executives may be indicted by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Whether or not there will be any indictments and when those indictments would be handed down, we have no comment,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clabault </PERSON>, one of several assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys working on the case. The federal prosecutor's office routinely declines comment on pending investigations. <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> pleaded guilty Oct. 21 to four counts of defrauding the government by overbilling on aircraft parts. It also pleaded guilty in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state to one count of mischarging on government contracts at its Seattle-area plant. Business Week also reported that <ORGANIZATION> Sunstrand </ORGANIZATION>, which makes electrical systems used in military and commercial jets, has agreed never to rehire 10 former executives, five of whom were fired Jan. 5 in a disciplinary action that involved 22 people. Also at the government's insistence, <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> agreed to revise its overhead accounting system, reducing the government's cost on most contracts by 20 percent to 40 percent, the magazine said. In addition, it said, the company has guaranteed price reductions on some <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracts and has separated government and commercial production at its plants. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Erikson </PERSON>, announced he was retiring.

<HEAD>Corporate Credit, Bond Ratings Decline In 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The overall quality of both corporate and municipal bonds declined in 1988, a credit-monitoring firm said Friday. Based on preliminary data, a record 386 corporate bond ratings were lowered last year, representing $ 171 billion of debt, according to <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The previous record was the 364 downgrades in 1986. Conversely, 261 corporate bond ratings were raised last year, representing $ 158 billion in debt, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P said. The number of upgrades in 1988 far surpassed the old high of 188 in 1987, it said. The number of ratings is greater than the number of companies issuing bonds because differing types of bonds issued by the same company receive separate ratings, S & amp; P said. Several leveraged buyouts and recapitalizations, especially in the retail industry, accounted for some of the lowered ratings, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P said. Notable upgrades included <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which together accounted for $ 42 billion of debt. The company said a negative trend continued in the ratings of debt offerings of financial institutions. In municipal bonds, S & amp; P said large declines in the quality of housing, utility and hospital issues more than offset positive trends in general obligation and airport, port and college revenue bonds. The firm said it lowered the ratings on 266 issues representing about $ 23 billion of debt, while it raised the ratings on 112 issues equaling about $ 17 billion of debt. In 1987, 269 municipal issues representing about $ 16.5 billion in debt were downgraded, while 153 ratings on $ 25 billion in debt were raised. The number of municipal bond issues increased in 1988 as the market recovered from the federal tax reform act, S & amp; P said. A total of 2,094 issues were rated last year, of which 82 were taxable. In 1987, 1,817 issues were rated, including 70 taxables.

 <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, Wall Street's largest firm, said Friday it would report a loss for the fourth quarter of 1988 due to bad investments in a troubled <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> bank The company also said it would revise downward its profit for the rest of 1988 because of previously reported accounting problems at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary that caters to wealthy clients. <PERSON> Shearson </PERSON> did not estimate the amount of quarterly loss from devalued securities in MCorp of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, but said it would release fourth-quarter figures later this month. One stock analyst put the loss at $ 15 million to $ 16 million. With capital exceeding $ 4.5 billion, 40,000 employees and more than 700 offices worldwide, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> i the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment firm. About 61 percent of it is owned by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the financial services giant. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> said it will record a pretax charge of $ 70 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 30 to reflect a further reduction in the value of <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> securities. Shearson initially lowered the value of the holdings in early 1988. To correct an overstatement in <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> earnings, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> said it would restate profit for the first three quarters of 1988 that will lower <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings for that period by $ 30 million, to about $ 110 million. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said the problem at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> stemmed from recording revenues that should have been deferred, and deferring expenses that should have been recorded. He said an unidentified employee disclosed the problem and there was no misuse of company or client assets. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> estimated the restatement would result in a $ 15 million profit reduction. It also said three top <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> officers were suspended with pay over the improper accounting. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Schick </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said a committee of outside auditors and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> officers is expected to determine who was responsible within a few weeks. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> declined to name the three suspended officers. They have been identified by <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> newspapers as President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Germeten </PERSON>, Executive Vice President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and Chief Financial Officer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. `` The review's conclusion was that what was involved here was accounting decisions that would boost the reported earnings,'' <PERSON> Schick </PERSON> said. `` In terms of what the motive was, I can not possibly speak to that. We do not believe that any laws were broken.'' <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> said it would have reported a fourth-quarter profit without the devaluation of MCorp holdings. <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Deans </PERSON>, who follows the securities industry for <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, estimated the profit would have been $ 30 million to $ 35 million, or 30 to 35 cents a share Because of the MCorp problem, the loss should be $ 15 million to $ 16 million, she said. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> said it owns <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> money market cumulative prefered stock with a face value of $ 117.5 million, and <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> subordinated debt securities with a principal amount of $ 29 million. After the adjustments, the preferred stock will be valued at $ 29.4 million and the debt securities at $ 11.6 million, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>, which has requested financial assistance from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in October declared a moratorium on payment of preferred stock dividends and principal and interest on debt. Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> acquired the <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> securities after it agreed to underwrite them, or bring them to market, in early 1988. There was a lack of investor interest and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> ending up buying them itself. It was unclear whether any other brokerage firms own MCorp securities in any significant amount. But Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said she did not foresee the fallout from the troubles in the banking and savings and loan industries becoming widespread in the securities industry. In composite <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s shares closed at $ 19.62 -LCB-, up 87 -LCB- cents from Thursday.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has allowed billionaire developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> to buy more shares of <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stock, a Trump official said Friday. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has already bought a block of Caesars World stock. In mid-December, he filed a notice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for a determination whether continued purchases would violate antitrust laws. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilbron </PERSON>, an executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> notified <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> on Monday that he could buy more stock. `` We did not receive any requests for additional information and they raised no questions about the antitrust implications,'' Ms. <PERSON> Heilbron </PERSON> said. In his request to the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> indicated he `` has the good-faith intention, subject to price, availability and necessary approvals,'' to acquire 15 percent of the stock. He also indicated he may `` decide to seek control of -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- through the acquisition of 50 percent -LRB- or -RRB- more of the outstanding voting securities.'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, owner of two casino-hotels in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and one under construction, has not indicated how much stock he purchased in the rival gaming company. But provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act require people or companies to file with the trade commission when they amass $ 15 million worth of stock in another company. The day after Trump officials received the notice from the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> shareholders adopted a shareholder rights program designed to prevent unfriendly takeovers. Under the new plan, if someone buys 20 percent of Caesars stock, or if someone with 10 percent appears only interested in forcing the company to buy back the stock at a premium, or if a person is unqualified to hold a gaming license, then all other <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> shareholders have the right to buy additional stock at half its market value. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has not commented on his involvement with <PERSON> Caesars </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Heilbron </PERSON> also said that even after the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> ruling, `` Mr. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> would not comment on his plans.''

<HEAD>Friday the 13th Economic News Helps Dollar, Stocks, Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The government's Friday the 13th economic reports showing higher inflation and a mixed picture for retail sales did n't cast any bad-luck spells on the financial markets, where the dollar rallied, bond prices jumped and stocks reached the highest level since the Wall Street crash 15 months ago. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the rate of increase in wholesale prices nearly doubled in 1988 to 4 percent, the worst pace since the early 1980s. Although inflation remains far below the double-digit era of last decade, many economists expressed concern. `` I do n't like the sound of a doubling of inflation, but we have to put 4 percent in perspective,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` It's not that bad, but it's not that good either. In another report released Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said retail sales in December rose a weak 0.2 percent, following strong increases in October and November. But for the year, retail spending rose 6.7 percent in 1988 to $ 1.61 trillion, the best performance in four years. The wholesale prices report had little effect on the markets, but some traders said the retail sales figure for December was weaker than expected and suggested that inflationary pressure was easing, which helped stocks and bonds. Others credited the strength in the markets to a relentless rise in the dollar's value despite coordinated dollar-selling by major central banks to stem the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's advance. A more expensive dollar makes investments denominated in the currency more attractive. In the bond market, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond rose nearly $ 10 per $ 1,000 in face value, while its yield declined from 8.97 percent late Thursday to 8.88 percent, the lowest in more than two months. Lower yields in the bond market encouraged investors to buy stocks and helped the market reach another in a recent series of post-crash highs. On Wall Street, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average rose 3.75 points to 2,226.07, finishing the week with a net gain of 31.78 points.

<TEXT>
 A group of 84 former <ORGANIZATION> Empire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilots now employed by <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> have filed a $ 25 million lawsuit against the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, N.C.-based airline, its parent company and the pilots' union. The suit will be served on <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> next week, said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> attorney who is representing the pilots. The suit claims the union arbitrarily refused to represent the pilots' seniority interests and other employment rights in the USAir-Piedmont merger and accuses all three organizations of breaching contractual obligations to ensure the pilots' interests were represented fairly, the attorney said. The suit was filed Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>. In December 1987, the pilots filed a $ 5.2 million lawsuit against the union and its <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Master </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which is pending. Both lawsuits seek to increase the pilots' seniority with <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> to include time spent flying for Empire. Empire, based in <LOCATION> Utica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, merged with <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> in 1986. The pilots' lawsuit contends they will lose pay, advancement opportunities and transfer ability during the decade following the merger because of their low placement on the integrated seniority list. <PERSON> Peterman </PERSON> said he expects the airlines and union to ask for the pilots' lawsuits to be consolidated. He said the 1987 lawsuit probably would go to a non-jury trial by year's end.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said Friday the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> stock market authority would be given greater powers to investigate possible insider trading deals. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> spoke after two simmering controversies involving a raid and a takeover took a political turn and threatened to embarrass the Socialist government. The takeover involved state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Pechiney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition late last year of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, whose main asset is the packaging company <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Can </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The stock market authority, the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bourse </ORGANIZATION>, is investigating that deal after receiving an alert from its counterpart, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier in the week the French press disclosed that a friend of <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> bought Triangle shares before the takeover was finalized. The raid involved an unsuccessful attempt to change the makeup of shareholder groups controlling the bank <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>, in which a state deposit institution provided a third of the funds involved. The right wing opposition charged that the involvement of the institution meant the government supported the move. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, speaking on a visit to the central French city of Dijon, said the controversy did not bother him and he hoped it would not bother the country. He said he had decided to broaden the stock market authority's areas of competence and means to control dealings Later, Prime Minister <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> said he would introduce legislation at the spring session of Parliament to reinforce the powers of the authority.
