 A judge on Monday sentenced the former pastor of a faith-healing sect to two years in prison for his part in the death of the son of church members, saying he wanted to send a message to cultists. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, was convicted of second-degree criminal mistreatment. <ORGANIZATION> Spokane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultheis </PERSON> said circumstances warranted going beyond the standard 90-day sentence for the crime, the maximum the prosecutor sought. `` I have an obligation to send a message ... to anyone who might be interested in beginning a religious cult,'' <PERSON> Schultheis </PERSON> told <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> was the former pastor of a nameless Christian sect that eschewed conventional medicine in favor of prayer. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, the 10-year-old son of sect members <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, died Dec. 20, 1987, of untreated juvenile diabetes. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, 43, was convicted last month of first-degree manslaughter for failing to seek medical attention for his son. Charges against Mrs. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> were dismissed prior to the trial. `` Why is it that it takes a tragedy for people to realize what they've been doing is wrong?'' asked <PERSON> Schultheis </PERSON>. `` Medicine has been given to us by <PERSON> God </PERSON> as much as the power of prayer.'' <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> also was sentenced to serve six months for a charge of simple assault stemming from a spanking administered to an adult church member in a separate incident. That sentence will be served concurrently, meaning <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> will be eligible for parole in 16 months, <PERSON> Schultheis </PERSON> said. Before he was sentenced, a tearful <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> told <PERSON> Schultheis </PERSON> he was `` absolutely ashamed'' of his participation in the sect and its `` rigid view of the outside world.'' `` I am absolutely heartbroken for what happened to <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said. Testimony during the three-week trial indicated the gravely ill boy was beaten the day before his death by his father and sect founder <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleber </PERSON> while <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> and other church elders watched. The beatings were believed necessary to get the boy to confess the sin of masturbation and be healed. As pastor, <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> knew, or should have known, that <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> was vulnerable, <PERSON> Schultheis </PERSON> said. Spankings and other discipline of the 10-year-old `` manifested deliberate cruelty,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Kleber </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Champaign-Urbana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, has pleaded guilty to second-degree criminal mistreatment and is scheduled to be sentenced later. Testimony also revealed that members were expected to consult with church leaders on matters ranging from buying a car to their sex lives. The fellowship once claimed 300 adult members in four states, but disbanded in February.

<HEAD>Pakistan Now Armed With Nuclear Weapons, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> appears to have finally developed atomic weapons, increasing the threat of a nuclear war with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and representing a major setback to efforts to stem the spread of atomic weapons around the globe, says a study published today. `` After a decade of slow advances, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> appears to have'' joined a group of three other nations that have nuclear weapons but do n't admit it, according to the review by the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>. The other countries in that category are <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said the report, the fourth such survey published by the non-profit group that specializes in national security studies. Five nations have said they possess nuclear weapons: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. A sixth, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, exploded a single atomic device in 1974 but said it was a non-military explosion. Efforts to halt the spread of nuclear weapons generally have focused on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, the report noted. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> have been the chief source of concern, since the two countries have fought three wars in the 41 years since they were created by the separation of colonial <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The report, titled `` The Undeclared Bombs,'' was written by <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spector </PERSON>, author of the three previous reports. <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> formerly worked on non-proliferation issues at the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> and Natural Resources non-proliferation subcommittee. In the past two years, <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> said, `` convincing evidence emerged that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> had crossed the nuclear weapons threshold and had acquired the essentials for its first nuclear weapons.'' That evidence includes production of highly enriched uranium, a key component of atomic weapons; and European reports of a previously clandestine effort by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> officials to smuggle sophisticated nuclear components out of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The Pakistani program is a dilemma for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> said in an interview, because <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is a prime recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid at the same time <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are pushing <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> not to develop atomic weapons. Two years ago, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> certified to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> did not possess nuclear weapons, a certification required by Capitol Hill before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid program could go ahead. But in recent months, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been less direct in asserting that the Pakistanis do n't have atomic weapons. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has responded by quietly expanding its atomic weapons capability and has also worked on development of delivery systems, including medium-range rockets, the report said. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has the ingredients to build between 20 and 50 atomic weapons, it said. For the future, <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> said, `` most observers are looking for some sort of mechanism, some kind of regional arrangement, to bring <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> into negotiations. The concept is to find a way to persuade both antagonists to restrain themselves. It will be difficult, but it may be achievable.'' The report also highlighted increasing dangers in the volatile <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION>, particularly in light of the spread of long-range missiles and chemical weapons among Arab enemies of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has refused to admit to possessing nuclear weapons, but the report said the Israelis have `` a substantial, undeclared nuclear arsenal of at least 50 to 60 nuclear devices _ and perhaps significantly more _ some of which are an advanced design.'' The risk of nuclear escalation in a future <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> war has `` seriously increased,'' the study said, because of the improved capabilities of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations to inflict damage through missiles and chemical weapons. `` Indeed, in 1988, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders began implicitly referring to this possibility by declaring that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would have the ability to retaliate against an anti-city missile or chemical attack ` many times over,''' it said. In <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the report said, a nuclear monitoring agreement between <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> should be the `` top non-proliferation priority for the coming year.'' That is because <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> announced last year that it had mastered the process of enriching uranium and had begun a pilot program at a plant that was not subject to international safeguards. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> had a similar capability at least five years ago, the report noted. While both nations have pledged not to produce weapons-grade uranium, those pledges need to be enshrined in formal policy, the study said.

 A premature baby stolen from a hospital two weeks ago by a woman posing as a nurse was found in good condition Monday, and the mother recommended the kidnapper `` just ask the Lord to forgive her for what she's done.'' <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who was born weighing only 4 pounds, was found at a home in <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, 50 miles away, by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and police responding to a tip to a hot line, said <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> Detective <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. The caller said the baby might be at the home, he said. <PERSON> Acqunetta </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushon </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 32, who has worked as a nurse's aide in <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> and has four childre, was charged with kidnapping, said <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. She was in jail Monday night and bond had not been set. A neighbor of Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said she had not seen the baby during the past two weeks. `` All I heard was that she had had a baby,'' <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON> said. `` I never seen him. When I would see her coming in and out of her house, it looked like she could have been an expectant mama, you know, with the clothes she wore.'' `` If she took the baby because of a loss in her own life, I hope that she will have the opportunity to get some help,'' the child's mother, <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas-Jones </PERSON>, said at a news conference Monday night `` I forgive her.'' She held the baby, dressed in a tiny white shirt reading `` Welcome Home,'' and said, `` He looks like $ 250 million wrapped up _ not just a million, but 250 million. He looks fantastic. He looks like his daddy.'' When she first was reunited with <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, she said, `` I held him and I looked at him and I checked his fingers out and his toes out and his legs and his stomach and his head and everything's there. `` I feel wonderful, I feel relieved, joyful, thankful. I'm happy,'' she said `` I knew the Lord was going to bring <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> home for us.'' Applause broke out from a crowd of about two dozen neighbors and members the news media when Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas-Jones </PERSON>, 32, and her husband, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 39, emerged from their house on their way to Doctors Hospital to be reunited with the infant. `` Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, hallelujah!'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas-Jones </PERSON> shouted. `` I just want to thank the media,'' she said, tears welling up in her eyes and her voice breaking with emotion. `` Praise the Lord.'' Local broadcasts and newspapers had carried repeated appeals by Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas-Jones </PERSON>, her minister and others for information leading to the baby's return. The reports all noted that <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> needed continued medical attention because he was six weeks premature when he was born Oct. 29. Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas-Jones </PERSON>, who has two daughters, handed him over Nov. 1 to a woman posing as a nurse at the hospital who said she needed to weigh the baby. A banner at Doctors Hospital read `` Welcome Home, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>'' in baby blue letters, and small baby blue ribbons were being handed out to employees and visitors by hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Szenher </PERSON>. Authorities first took <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> AMI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> for an examination, said hospital executive director <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> <PERSON> Kass </PERSON>. `` The baby is in good condition, needs only what a normal infant should need, as far as we know,'' <PERSON> Kass </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> gained 1 -RCB- pounds since being kidnapped, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettus </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Keathley </PERSON>, a pediatrician from Doctors Hospital who examined the baby, said: `` I was surprised.

<HEAD>Millions Of Transport Workers To Be Subject To Drug Tests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Millions of transportation workers including pilots and truckers will be subject to random drug tests under a new federal directive that is likely to be challenged in court before it goes into effect in December 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced the broad-ranging drug testing requirements Monday, and immediately the head of the airline pilots' union promised to fight the regulation both in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and in the courts. The testing requirements cover all types of transportation, including airlines, long-distance trucks and urban transit systems. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people demand and expect a drug-free transportation system. These new rules will take us as far as practically possible toward that goal,'' <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said at a news conference. He acknowledged the tests likely will be challenged in the courts. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> already has before it two separate drug-testing cases _ including one involving post-accident testing of railroad workers _ that are expected to be decided next year. The series of federal regulations announced by <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> call for transportation companies _ airlines, trucking companies, railroads and commercial shipping companies _ to have comprehensive testing programs in place by December 1989. Companies with 50 or fewer employees, including tens of thousands of over-the-road independent truckers, have another year to comply. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimated the testing will cost businesses more than $ 2.1 billion during the first 10 years, but <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said the testing will save the same companies about $ 8.7 billion in increased productivity, accident reductions and medical cost savings. In addition to random tests, the regulations call for drug testing before employment if there is reasonable cause to suspect drug use, periodically such as during annual physicals, and after an accident. The drugs covered by the tests are marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines and PCP. The random-testing provision, which requires that at least 50 percent of a given work force be tested during a single year, has attracted the strongest protests, especially from unions. They argue that such tests constitute an invasion of privacy, have minimal benefit and will subject thousands of workers to the consequences of `` false positive'' results. `` Random testing is a counterproductive, shotgun strategy that is at the same time an unwarranted invasion of privacy and of no significant value in the battle against drug abuse,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, president of the 40,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The required testing programs cover: _ Nearly 3 million long-distance truckers, including independent drivers and those who work directly for large trucking companies Intercity bus drivers also must be tested. _ More than 538,000 aviation employees, including 50,000 commercial pilots, 80,000 flight attendants and 300,000 airline mechanics Air traffic controllers already are subject to similar testing requirements. _ About 90,000 railroad industry workers, including engineers, brakemen and train dispatchers _ Nearly 200,000 urban transit workers, including subway and transit bus drivers and mechanics _ About 200,000 merchant seamen and other mariners on commercial vessels that carry passengers or cargo Fishermen are not covered by the rules. Critics question whether the regulations can be enforced, at least as they pertain to independent long-distance truck drivers. DOT officials said such independents will have to join in `` testing pools'' or be tested under a program operated by the company for which they do business. Officials acknowledged the rules do not require truckers to carry proof that they are participating in a testing program. `` The big question is how are you going to enforce it'' in the case of the self-employed independents, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the trucking companies. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> of the airline pilots union said he fears random testing `` may be used by management as a punitive measure against pilots.'' He criticized the DOT regulation for leaving the program to be administered by management with no requirement for rehabilitation. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said the aim is `` getting the people -LRB- with drug problems -RRB- off the jobs.'' He said the issue of rehabilitation will have to be worked out through labor-management negotiations. DOT officials said in the last two years there have been 60 railroad accidents in which participants were found to have been using drugs, although drug use was not always directly implicated in the accidents. The worst of these was a Jan. 4, 1987 collision of a <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> locomotive and an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> passenger train in Chase, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, in which 16 people were killed and 178 were injured. The <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> engineer and brakeman admitted having smoked marijuana shortly before the accident.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> is moving toward a showdown vote on whether to reject a draft <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> document questioning the theological authority of such conferences. The bishops softened the wording of their proposed reply to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> document on Monday but pressed toward a scheduled Wednesday vote without changing their underlying judgment: `` The draft is not suitable.'' Despite frequent public compliments from both sides, relations have often been uneasy between the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and bishops' conferences, particularly those such as the Americans' which have seemed to be growing in prestige in recent years. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II has publicly supported many of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conference's efforts, including national pastoral letters that stirred controversy outside the church for their criticism of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies on nuclear arms and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. However, there also has been criticism from high <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials, who have asked for whom the bishops were speaking in commenting on matters of doctrine, and on what authority. Also on Monday, acceding to a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> request, the bishops postponed a vote on another controversial item _ but did so only grudgingly and with rare public complaints about the way church leaders in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> had handled the situation. While the bishops gave ground, they took pains to say they were not knuckling under to <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> pressure. `` We have not bowed obsequiously to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in an untoward fashion,'' said Archbishop <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipscomb </PERSON> of Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, objecting to a reporter's suggestion that that was what had happened. About 300 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Roman Catholic cardinals, archbishops and bishops had been scheduled to vote today on new guidelines for settling disputes between theologians and bishops. But a letter from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith complained that the guidelines would make the theologians and bishops equals in the settlement process. Bishop <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Lessard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, chairman of the bishops' <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctrine </ORGANIZATION>, said he felt all that was `` sufficiently addressed'' in the guidelines document However, he added that it seemed wise to postpone action until the bishops' June meeting. Several bishops complained about the timing of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s complaint, including Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, who said the intervention `` might be perceived as confrontational or as belittling the episcopal conference, which I know is not intended. Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> agency was understaffed, a possible explanation for the last-minute nature of the objection. However, Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, president of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops conference, said the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> had had the proposal for more than a year. As for the draft <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> document on bishops' conferences, a number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops apparently had been stung by news stories quoting in advance from the proposed rejection notice. The new version, distributed by a committee of past conference presidents on Monday, is considerably toned down from the original, which had used such phrases as `` rigid and confusing'' and `` overly defensive and negative'' to describe the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> draft. However, it still calls for the bishops to label the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> effort `` non-placet,'' so flawed that it is n't even suitable to be used as a basis for revision. Several bishops objected to such a label, suggesting it would be a slap at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. This raised the possibility that the conference's objections would have to be softened further if they are to win the two-thirds majority necessary in Wednesday's vote. In other action Monday, the bishops: _ Gave first reading to one proposal that would call for easing of a 1986 law and give legal standing to many more undocumented Hispanic workers, and to another resolution calling for acceleration of religious freedom and an end to intimidation of worshipers in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other Eastern bloc countries _ Postponed action on a resolution calling for movement toward normalization of relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Archbishop <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Vietnamese-American </PERSON> groups in this country were divided on the issue, but he said the postponement was merely to give the bishops time to consider conditions in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> in general. _ Heard Archbishop <PERSON> Pio </PERSON> <PERSON> Laghi </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> representative to the bishops as well as to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, call for greater effort in keeping Hispanic-Americans in the church He did not publicly mention the simmering Vatican-bishops disputes.

<HEAD>Study Shows Poor Physical Fitness Triples Heart Risk in Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Women in poor physical shape are three times more likely to die at an early age of heart disease than are those who keep themselves in good condition, according to a long-term study. Dr. <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ekelund </PERSON>, the principal author of the study, said it provides the first strong evidence that exercise protects women from heart disease, just as it does men. Poor physical fitness `` is almost as important as smoking as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease'' in women, said <PERSON> Ekelund </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>. The study was based on a 10 -LCB- - year follow-up of 2,802 women who ranged in age from 30 to 69 The results were presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` This had been seen in males. Now it carries over into females,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> McHenry </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Krannert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. `` This confirms what we all expected.'' During the study, women walked on treadmills while their heart rates were measured. Those who are physically fit have lower heart rates while exercising than do people who are in poor shape. The researchers divided the women into four groups, depending on their heart rates. During mild exercise, those in the most fit group averaged 107 beats per minute, compared with 152 beats among the least fit women. During the decade of followup, 40 women died of heart attacks, strokes and heart failure. The risk of cardiovascular death was less than 1 percent among the fit women and 2 percent in those who were unfit. <PERSON> Ekelund </PERSON> said that while much of the difference in physical fitness may be inherited, people can also improve their level of fitness by exercise. `` It has been shown by many studies that you can improve fitness levels by just walking,'' he said. `` Many people could benefit from this. Later, if they felt like they needed more, they could progress to jogging. But the important thing is to have a regular exercise program.'' The new findings in women are similar to those reported by the same researchers in a study of men. <PERSON> Ekelund </PERSON> said the risk of being out of shape is close to that of smoking or high blood pressure. Being unfit may be more of a problem for women than for men, he said, because less than 20 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> women say they get regular physical activity, compared with about a third of all men. Among other studies presented at the meeting: _ Consumption of fat by Americans has fallen substantially since the mid-1960s Dr. <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saskatchewan </ORGANIZATION> said people may simply be trimming meat better and throwing away more fat. She said the dietary change may be a major cause of the drop in heart attack deaths that began in the late 1960s. _ Doctors report progress in developing a variety of devices that clean out clogged heart arteries by shaving, sanding and burning away fatty deposits All of them are intended to improve or replace balloon angioplasty, a widely used procedure in which doctors reopen clogged arteries by temporarily inflating tiny balloons inside them. _ The heart disease death rate is declining dramatically among middle-aged white men A study by Dr. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuller </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> showed that in one county in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, the death rate in this group fell 53 percent between 1970 and 1984. A decline in cardiac arrest accounted for the largest share of the drop.

And of course, Monday night's program consisted of three <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> compositions that were played shimmeringly well. As well it should: It was the 1,215 th time <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> conducted the orchestra On Nov. 14, 1943, <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, the Philharmonic's then-assistant conductor, filled for an ailing <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> on such short notice there was no rehearsal. The concert was broadcast nationally on radio. And there was such acclaim that <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, who had never led the orchestra in concert until that day, was catapulted to fame, at age 25. At intermission, Mrs. <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodzinski </PERSON>, whose late husband was the Philharmonic music's director in 1943 and hired <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> as his assistant, was introduced from a box. Violinist <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Margolies </PERSON>, who played in the Philharmonic that Sunday, is still a member and was playing on Monday night.

<HEAD>Psychotherapy May Help Prevent Cancer and Heart Disease, Studies
Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Risks for cancer or heart disease may be revealed through analyzing personality, and psychotherapy may be able to head off the diseases, according to controversial research. `` If the research ... holds up under ongoing scientific scrutiny, we will be entering a new era of health care and disease prevention,'' British psychologist <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Eysenck </PERSON> writes in the December issue of Psychology Today. The thrust of research by <PERSON> Eysenck </PERSON> and psychologist <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossarth-Maticek </PERSON> is that repressed emotions and hopelessness may lead to cancer, and hostility and aggression to heart disease. <PERSON> Grossarth-Maticek </PERSON> has developed a six-question personality quiz to identify people prone to cancer or heart disease, <PERSON> Eysenck </PERSON> writes. But in a statement accompanying Eysenck's article, senior editor <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischman </PERSON> warns that researchers have spotted inconsistencies and technical problems in <LOCATION> Grossarth-Maticek </LOCATION>'s studies. One psychologist found the studies `` unable to achieve the level of certainty that science demands,'' <PERSON> Fischman </PERSON> writes. `` The findings right now represent more hope than certainty, but it is because of that hope, and the hope for further debate and research, that we are presenting them,'' <PERSON> Fischman </PERSON> writes. According to Eysenck, <PERSON> Grossarth-Maticek </PERSON>'s studies supported the theory by predicting disease 10 years or more before people died of it. In that research, almost half the people considered cancer-prone died from that disease and fewer than a tenth from heart disease. Of those considered at risk for heart disease, about a third died of it but only one-fifth died of cancer, <PERSON> Eysenck </PERSON> wrote. Other studies found the risk could be reduced through psychotherapy aimed at the personality flaws, <PERSON> Eysenck </PERSON> wrote. For example, 45 of 50 people considered cancer-prone who went through psychotherapy were still alive 13 years later, compared to 19 of another 50 at risk who did not receive psychotherapy, he said. Some studies also suggest similar psychotherapy can help people with cancer live longer, he said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told a group of schoolchildren that he believes it's `` inevitable'' that a woman will one day be president, most likely after first serving as vice president. The president's comments came during a question-and-answer session with junior and senior high school students from four Washington-area schools. `` As a matter of fact, the statesman in the world that I have met, that I respect the most, is the prime minister of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, and she's done a remarkable job for <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>,'' the president said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will play host to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> for an official visit and state dinner at the White House later this week.

<HEAD>Trade Problems To Face Incoming Agriculture Secretary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nagging trade problems and preliminary maneuvering on a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm bill will face the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's incoming secretary of agriculture next year. Lobbying for the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post already is in full swing, although President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his advisors have been focusing on other matters and have dropped no hints about who might get the job. Trade issues will be near the top of the agenda for the new agriculture secretary. Little progress has been made in reaching agreement on farm provisions of a new 97-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- agreement, despite two years of talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> call for phasing out farm subsidies by the year 2000 has received a chilly reception. Also stalled are talks aimed at reaching a new long-term grain agreement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The most recent, five-year agreement expired Sept. 30 and there have been no formal talks since Oct. 24, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rejected a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> proposal calling for a one-year agreement. A free-trade agreement that would phase out most tariffs between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> had been approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but is running into trouble in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. That is not viewed as altogether bad among some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat producers and potato growers who never had much use for the pact anyway. Failure of the agreement, however, would be guaranteed to make life more complex for the next agriculture secretary. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION> plan to start talking next year about a farm bill to replace the omnibus 1985 farm legislation that expires in two years. The 1985 law is largely a blueprint for a massive cleanout of huge grain surpluses that had piled up, driving down prices and bringing on what came to be known as the crisis in rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Huge subsidies were provided to boost exports at clearance sale prices as part of the effort to make farm surpluses disappear. Surplus milk and cheese remaining on the shelf were simply given away to the poor. The measure is generally viewed as a success. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> analysts say net cash income for the farm sector in 1988 should be near, and may top by a small margin last year's record $ 57.1 billion, despite the summer drought. For that reason many in the agricultural community think there will be little change in the thrust of the next bill. But the secretary is certain to face an array of tough challenges as lawmakers set about their work. New programs to help specific crops are bound to be debated along with plans to reform the troubled federal crop insurance program and further tighten pesticide regulation. With the 70-year-old Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> saying the time for retirement has arrived, or at least will when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is sworn in, candidates are lining up for the secretary's job. One who says he does not want to serve in the Cabinet and would like to return to private industry is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. The one-time <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> feedlot operator had long been mentioned as a possible future agriculture secretary. Getting a strong boost from congressional Republicans is Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, R-Mo. He is a force on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> but is not a farmer and, thus, like <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, might need to have someone with experience in production agriculture in the deputy secretary's slot <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>'s deputy, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, raised crops and livestock in southeastern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> between 1955 and 1982, when he came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to become head of the Soil and <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. He has become a favorite at <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign assurances to voters that he is an environmentalist might sway him to opt for <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, the architect of several major soil conservation measures contained in the 1985 farm law. That far from exhausts the list. If <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>'s low-key, businesslike approach captures <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s fancy, the new president could turn to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesher </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consultant and former <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> business partner. Also being mentioned are former Rep. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> soybean farmer <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> past President <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Delano </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Supreme Court: No Abortion Veto Rights for Fathers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, at least for now, is keeping out of the continuing national debate over abortion rights. The justices on Monday refused to give husbands legal power to prevent their wives from terminating pregnancies. Without comment, they rejected arguments by an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> man who said he had `` fundamental rights and interests in his unborn child.'' The action left intact a state court ruling that upheld a mother's right to have an abortion. There has been speculation that an increasingly conservative high court is prepared to take a new look at its landmark 1973 ruling, <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, that legalized abortion nationwide. The author of the 12-year-old court opinion, Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, has said he believes there is `` a very distinct possibility'' <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> will be reversed during the court's current term But on Monday, the justices gave no signs they are eager to tackle an abortion controversy now. The court let stand a ruling last July by the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that said allowing a husband to block a wife's abortion is barred by past high court rulings. The high court in 1976 struck down a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law requiring spousal consent before a woman could obtain an abortion during the first 12 weeks of her pregnancy. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> case stems from an attempt last summer by <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Conn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Elkhart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, to prevent his estranged wife, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, from having an abortion. She was about six weeks pregnant at the time. A state trial judge issued a temporary order barring Mrs. <PERSON> Conn </PERSON> from having the operation, but a state appeals court threw out that order. `` <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> has no right to veto <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>'s decision ... as such decision concerns only her,'' the appeals court ruled. The <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the appeals court ruling. The injunction prohibiting Mrs. <PERSON> Conn </PERSON>'s abortion was lifted last July 22 and she had an abortion. The Conns are in the midst of divorce proceedings. <PERSON> Conn </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> of Terre Haute, said a decree is expected within days The father argued that the 1973 and 1976 high court rulings did not preclude state courts from taking a husband's rights into consideration `` on a case-by-case basis.'' `` The father has fundamental rights and interests in his unborn child which should be judicially considered, on the facts of this case, along with the rights and interests of his wife in aborting their child,'' lawyers for <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> <PERSON> Conn </PERSON> said. But the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> courts rejected such a balancing test. In other action, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>: _ Cleared the way for enforcement of federal court subpoenas requiring <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> and <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to turn over financial records and other material to a grand jury The justices refused to shield the deposed president and first lady of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> from the subpoenas, related to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> case in which they are charged with looting their nation's treasury of more than $ 100 million. _ Ruled, 6-3, in a case from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> that states may hold a second sentencing trial for a defendant mistakenly sent to prison as a habitual offender _ Let stand a ruling in a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> case that the federal Voting Rights Act, designed to prevent racial discrimination, applies to state judicial elections _ Agreed to consider the constitutionality of a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> law aimed at assuring that beer sold in the state costs no more than it does in three neighboring states _ Agreed to decide in a case from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> whether investors' claims against brokers must be settled by binding arbitration _ Agreed to use a case from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> involving truckers and one from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> involving a liquor distributor to determine whether states must refund taxes collected under laws later declared unconstitutional

He advocates establishing a $ 50 billion line of credit from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, to be partly repaid from the sale of loans and property from failed S & amp; Ls. `` Nobody wants a taxpayer bailout ... but there are limits to what the industry can do and they've reached those limits,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brokers </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> later told reporters, `` If it ever gets around that there's nothing insuring those accounts and deposits, you could have chaos.'' Some analysts said they believed <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' sometimes confrontational style could further fragment an already divided <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, thus complicating congressional efforts to find a solution to the S & amp; L industry crisis. `` He's bright. He understands problems and he can be very direct with what he says,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, a financial institutions consultant in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` But it's one thing to be able to make cogent comments and it's another thing to be able to forge a legislative compromise. That may be where he has problems.'' A new banking chairman is also taking over in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., is expected to succeed <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., who is The new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration likely will fill the leadership vacuum left by the transition in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, according to <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brumbaugh </PERSON>, a savings industry consultant and former chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. But, he added, `` it's hard not to believe this is going to slow momentum.'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a 27-year veteran of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, gets high marks from colleagues for personal integrity and a willingness to speak his mind. They also say he is a likeable man, despite a temper that caused him two years ago to slug a man who called him a communist. However, many question <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s ability to rein in his own views enough to ride herd on a committee with more than 50 members and nearly as many factions. In 1977, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> was appointed to chair a special committee to investigate the assassinations of President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. But within weeks he quit in a dispute with the chief counsel, leaving the committee in turmoil. As chairman of the Banking subcommittee on housing since 1981, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> has shown a confrontational style. He once called Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, the only black member of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, `` a Stepin Fetchit.'' He also had advocated the impeachment of former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, who was pushing up interest rates in the early 1980s to fight inflation. Former Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reuss </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Democrat who preceded <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> as banking committee chairman, says <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> might do better in the post than many expect. Under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration it just has not been possible to pass housing legislation, <PERSON> Reuss </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> has `` shown a capacity to learn and grow ... and I think that will stand <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in good stead.'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> discounted talk that he may be too rigid in his views. `` I've never considered myself an ideologue no matter how I've been labeled,'' he said `` You -LRB- ca n't -RRB- last in politics unless you're in the traditional American vein of pragmatism.'' He said much of the criticisms circulating are `` hobgoblins calculatedly set forth by those who ... have ambitions themselves.''

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, just finished with a two-mile run, bounded across the beach and threw himself into the choppy waters. He caught a wave, body-surfed in and swam around a while. Later he waded back in shoulder-deep to cast a fishing line against the brisk waves. After an hour or so, he took a break to visit his mother and go to church, then piloted a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs power boat some 40 miles back down the coast and leaped into the water for more fishing. Afterward he played nine holes of golf. This was a typical vacation day for the 64-year-old man who takes over the White House next Jan. 20. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> showed during his four-day stay in this balmy beach community that his idea of relaxation is physical activity. He enjoys a variety of outdoor sports. One day he followed his morning jog with a trip out to a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter 400 yards offshore in a motorized raft. He jumped off the cutter and swam part of the way in, then grabbed a rope off the raft for an arm-numbing tow to shore against the choppy waters. White House physician Dr. <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> has pronounced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s fitness `` exceptional for a man his age'' and expressed amazement at his health and stamina His loping walk is that of a younger man, and he moves around a tennis court with an alacrity that makes up for his unimpressive serve. In an Election Day match, he and son <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> played doubles with son <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and son-in-law <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBlond </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, just hours before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> learned he had been elected president. The president-to-be lunged for balls and zigzagged across the court, energetic and clearly competitive with the younger men. Toward the end of his long presidential campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> complained of physical fatigue, saying he missed having the time to jog, which he said invigorates him. Often on the campaign trail he had a stationary bicycle brought to his hotel room. Since the election, he seems to be making up for the inactivity of long airplane rides and motorcades. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in a beachfront news conference that his Friday-through-Tuesday morning vacation in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> helped him clear his mind. `` I've been able to run every day,'' he said. `` I love the fishing. It does n't matter what you catch, it's the fact you're out there and fishermen know that. And so I'm still of the <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> school, that the days I spend fishing should not be deducted from the time I spend on earth.''

 A vegetarian diet, quitting cigarettes, moderate exercise and up to an hour a day of yoga meditation can help reverse heart disease symptoms without the use of drugs, according to a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> study. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornish </PERSON>, a professor of medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said that instead of using any drugs, his program forced dramatic changes in lifestyle to bring a significant improvement in the health of patients with coronary artery disease. The program is radical, he admits, but for the small group tested, it worked. `` For many who have heart disease,'' said <PERSON> Ornish </PERSON>, `` the conventional therapy -LRB- which includes drugs or surgery, some diet revision and exercise -RRB- may not go far enough.'' <PERSON> Ornish </PERSON> outlined his research in a paper presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He devised a strict program that started with a week of training and preparation, a vegetarian diet that was less than 10 percent fat, and 16 hours a week of group therapy. Patients who smoked were required to quit. A moderate exercise program, usually walking, was devised individually for each patient. And, to manage stress, the patients were taught yoga meditation and relaxation exercises. To test the concept, <PERSON> Ornish </PERSON> put 50 patients with coronary artery disease into two groups. All were tested to find the condition of their arteries, how well their hearts were supplied with blood, and the amount of cholesterol in their bloodstream. Cholesterol is a fatty material in blood that can lead to clogged arteries. For those in the first group, <PERSON> Ornish </PERSON> provided the traditional lifestyle care, which included some counseling on how to lower cholesterol levels, controlling high blood pressure and quitting smoking. The second group, however, was placed on what <PERSON> Ornish </PERSON> called `` a very demanding regimen'' of lifestyle changes. `` We were asking them to make huge changes in their lifestyle and then evaluated the effects'' using high technology X-ray and imaging techniques, he said. The program started with a seven-day retreat during which the patients were evaluated by a psychologist and by exercise experts. They were taught how to use yoga to relieve stress, and were placed on the strict diet. After the retreat, the group met for eight hours, two days a week for instruction sessions in exercise, yoga and food preparation. `` We provided the low-fat food for some in take-home containers,'' said <PERSON> Ornish </PERSON>. `` They found it was not as hard as you would think. The group support goes a long way.'' At the end of a year, 29 patients completed the testing analysis _ 12 in the lifestyle changes group, and 17 in the ordinary care, or control, group. For the control group, the arterial lesions, or clogging of vessels supplying blood to heart, grew worse. Vessels that were 44.1 percent blocked closed further, to 46.2 percent blocked. For the lifestyle group, the progression of the disease was halted and some arteries measurably opened up, providing additional blood flow to the heart. They went from an average of 44.4 percent blocked to 40.8 percent, a clear regression improvement in the artery health, said <PERSON> Ornish </PERSON>. `` There was a significant decrease in blockages in the lifestyle treatment group and a significant increase in blockages in the control group,'' he said. <PERSON> Ornish </PERSON> said he used yoga and other stress control techniques because earlier studies have shown `` emotional stress can play a role in increasing and reducing lesions.'' Also, he said, `` stress can increase cholesterol -LRB- in the bloodstream -RRB- regardless of diet.'' <PERSON> Ornish </PERSON> said studies have shown, for instance, that cholesterol rates go up for drivers during auto races and for students during final examinations. `` Yoga is an ancient way of managing stress,'' said <PERSON> Ornish </PERSON>. `` It's very practical.'' He said patients were urged to meditate an hour a day. Cholesterol counts in the treatment group declined from a median of 227 milligrams per decaliter to 135, well below the recommended maximum of 200. Patients in the study were aged 40 to 74, he said, and those who were the sickest seemed to be helped the most. `` The blockages that were the most severe seem to improve the greatest,'' said <PERSON> Ornish </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> scientist cautioned that though the results were encouraging, they are preliminary, and that the number of patients was too small to draw final conclusions on the value of the treatment system.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, the Nobel laureate and Soviet human rights activist, says Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is using `` undemocratic means'' in attempts to improve conditions in their country. `` From my point of view this is dangerous,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said. He spoke Monday to a group of American intellectuals after comparing notes on human rights and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the White House. Today, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> is scheduled to receive the <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> peace prize and a $ 50,000 award for making `` an enormous impact on the conscience of the world.'' A nuclear physicist who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has long been the principal human rights advocate in his country. He was confined to virtual house arrest in Gorky for six years until <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> arranged his release in 1986. The Soviet leader also arranged for <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s first visit to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, at a session Monday of the <ORGANIZATION> Woodrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholars </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may not have a long-range program for reform. He said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> improvises, and often `` compromises with existing forces that negate his efforts.'' Specifically, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear physicist criticized <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s consolidation of power, the absence of multi-party and free-market systems as well as restrictions on meetings and demonstrations `` There is no clear realization how this system should be reformed,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said. In fact, he said, the partial reforms arranged by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could lead to `` disequilibrium.'' Before leaving the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on his first trip to the West, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> leveled similar criticisms at the Soviet president. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> supports glasnost _ a term for openness that has marked <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s 3 -LCB- years in power _ but complains that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leader has accumulated too much power as both president and Communist party chief. `` His tactic seems to be getting democratic reforms through undemocratic means,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said. `` From my point of view this is a dangerous action.'' On the human rights front, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said some dissidents remain in psychiatric institutions along with many more people who were chronic critics of their employers. He called the detention system `` one of the most acute abuses'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Earlier, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> discussed the plight of dissidents with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the White House. The president said until the problem is `` completely eliminated'' human rights will remain an irritant in U.S.-Soviet relations. The 67-year-old <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for about 20 minutes in the Oval Office. They shared a cautious approach to the measures taken by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, mindful of reporters at a picture-taking session, drew <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s attention to two dissidents, <PERSON> Vazif </PERSON> <PERSON> Meylanov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Kukobaka </PERSON>, who <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said still are being held. He called the detention of <PERSON> Meylanov </PERSON> `` ironic'' since he was sent to prison protesting the removal of <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to Gorky in 1980. `` I'm free to travel and he is in prison,'' the human rights activist said. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, speaking through an interpreter, said <PERSON> Kukobaka </PERSON> is in prison for refusing to bear false witness against a foreign diplomat. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as more cooperative than any <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader before him, but said `` we can only wait and see'' if the Soviet leader makes good on a promise to release all political prisoners. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> told the president `` there are only individuals'' left in jails, implying that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in principle at least, does not adhere to a policy of detaining dissidents for their views. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, also voiced concern about the impact that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s missile defense program, known popularly as Star Wars, might have on efforts by the superpowers to negotiate a cut in long-range nuclear missile stockpiles.

<HEAD>Energy Department Corrects Natural Gas Figures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Energy Department says it overestimated how much natural gas American industry has been using, a mistake that had set off false alarms about the energy efficiency of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. The error arose when a new reporting form confused many of the companies that report gas deliveries to the department's <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> EIA </ORGANIZATION>'s quarterly publication `` Short Term Energy Outlook'' for October, which reached users Monday, said the previous quarter's estimates of industrial natural gas consumption in the first half of 1988 were about 8 percent too high The agency started checking its statistics when the July edition of its outlook reported a 26 percent first-half increase in industrial gas use, implausibly high. In fact, the first half increase was about 6 percent to 3.13 trillion cubic feet. Natural gas is a major source of energy for home heating, electricity generation, chemical manufacture and industrial process heat. A little less than a quarter of all energy comes frm gas; industrial gas use is about 8 percent of the total national energy bill. Without the exaggerated natural gas changes, there would have been no significant change in the estimated energy efficiency in the economy, the closely watched ratio of energy used in producing a dollar's worth of goods and services. Environmentalists use this as a rough indicator of damage to the environment from economic activity; policymakers watch it as an indication of future vulnerability to interruption of oil imports. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> EIA </ORGANIZATION> analyst, said the agency distributed new reporting forms to gas companies delivering gas to industrial users with the start of 1988. The new forms asked for physical deliveries of gas no matter who owned it. The old forms required listing deliveries only of gas owned by the reporting company, no matter who delivered it. Some companies continued to report the old way, which meant some gas was counted twice _ once by the owner, once by the shipper. <ORGANIZATION> EIA </ORGANIZATION> said `` 43 companies apparently have consistently misreported their monthly'' deliveries, resulting in `` an overstatement of industrial consumption in the first six months of 1988 of 0.5 trillion cubic feet.'' Now that the errors have been corrected, the agency expects industrial gas use of 6.15 trillion cubic feet for all of 1988, only a 4.4 percent gain, instead of the 19 percent increase projected in July on the basis of the overestimates. The energy crises of the 1970s prompted major efficiency improvements everywhere. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, for example, autos averaged about 13 miles per gallon of gasoline in 1973; <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> required 27.5 mpg by 1985, a goal since relaxed to 26 mpg. More efficient processes have continued to be introduced in industry, and energy efficiency gains accelerated from an average of 1.2 percent per year in the 1970s to 2.8 percent in 1980-1986. But in 1987, for the first time in 11 years, efficiency failed to improve, a stagnation many analysts attributed to the collapse in oil prices of 1986. It took 19,960 British thermal units, or Btu, to produce a dollar's worth of goods and services in 1987, measured in dollars of 1982 buying power. This was roughly the same as the 19,950 Btu of 1986. A Btu is a standard unit of energy, equal to the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. In July the agency forecast a 1988 ratio of 20,180 Btu per dollar, or a 1.1 percent decline from 1987, and a 1989 ratio of 20,050, a 0.6 percent improvement from 1988. The corrected October forecast predicts 19,840 Btu per dollar, an improvement of 0.6 percent from 1987, and improvement of 1.3 percent to 19,590 Btu in 1989. One analyst, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Durning </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an environmental research group, said, `` I could believe'' an improvement of 0.6 percent. `` I would expect gains ... in the aggregate of about a half percent per year, just from the technologies and how much room for improvement there is, almost indefinitely,'' <PERSON> Durning </PERSON> said. But at the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, analyst <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Schipper </PERSON> said that even after the data corrections, `` As far as I'm concerned that's no change. There's a plateau. ... If I were a policymaker I'd be worried.''

<HEAD>Study Recommends New National Emphasis On Preserving Wetlands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A major environmental study today recommended that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> set a national goal of reversing the centuries-old trend of destroying more wetlands than are created. The report called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve legislation encouraging the formation of wetlands preservation trusts, perhaps by restoring some tax incentives for land donations that were restricted by the 1986 tax law overhaul. The study group, called the National Wetlands Policy Forum, is composed of state and federal government officials, industry representatives and environmental interests. It was convened by the <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a private Washington-based research group, at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The report urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to add wetlands restoration and creation to the missions of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> and other agencies. It said these agencies, along with the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, should be required to organize a major effort to seek out public lands for restoration, especially where government activity had caused wetlands to be lost. Existing federal and state protective programs are `` too cumbersome and the responsibilities too diffuse'' to guarantee protection of wetlands, the report said. `` It is a system that allows hundreds of thousands of wetland acres to continue to be lost or degraded annually, almost unnoticed, while substantial resources and time often are devoted to determining the fate of a few relatively small areas,'' it said. `` The fact that the protection of wetlands makes good economic as well as environmental sense for society but not necessarily for the individual owning them is central to much of the conflict over wetlands protection policies,'' the report said. Setting a national goal of reversing the trend toward a shrinking wetlands base `` does not imply that individual wetlands will in every instance be untouchable.'' the report said. It said the aim should be that `` the nation's overall wetlands base reach equilibrium between losses and gains in the short run and increase in the long term.'' No one knows how fast swamps, marshes, bogs and other wetlands are being lost at present, although the 200 million acres present at the time Europeans settled what became the lower 48 states are believed to have been cut in half through conversion to farms, urban settlement and other uses. One study estimated that in the two decades leading up to 1975, 400,000 to 500,000 acres were lost every year. Only in recent decades has it become widely recognized that wetlands serve important environmental functions by storing flood water, supporting a third of the nation's endangered species, nursing and spawning 60 percent to 90 percent of commercial fish catches, reducing erosion, recharging groundwater, filtering sediment and controlling pollution. `` At the extreme, as in the case of some migratory birds, habitat functions can extend even to other continents,'' the report said. The report called on all states to enact wetlands conservation legislation if they have not done so, and to draft plans showing how they would meet goals of the forum report. Under the Clean Water Act, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> could delegate many of its wetlands responsibilities to states with approved plans. The <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coast must get priority attention in considering a search for public land for wetlands restoration, perhaps through diversion of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> sediment into the region. The report said the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coast is suffering `` extremely high wetlands losses from erosion ... largely as a result of government flood control and other water resource projects.'' Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> served as chairman of the wetlands policy forum, with Govs. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as vice chairmen.

 The Soviet space shuttle Buran touched down on a concrete runway in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> on Tuesday morning, flawlessly ending its unmanned 3 hour, 25 minute maiden voyage, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> has successfuly tested its first reusable space craft Buran,'' the official radio said. `` The unmanned shuttle has just landed on a special runway near the Baikonur Space Center,'' it said, interrupting its regular programming. The delta-winged Buran, Russian for snowstorm, had orbited Earth twice, lifting off on schedule despite a cold rain. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the shuttle landed exactly on schedule. A previous attempt to launch the Buran had been frustrated by last-minute technical troubles. The shuttle was launched at 6 a.m. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> time -LRB- 10 p.m. Monday EST -RRB- in yellow flame and clouds of white steam from the special launch site in the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>.

 The Soviet space shuttle Buran touched down Tuesday morning on a concrete runway in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, flawlessly ending its unmanned 3-hour, 25-minute maiden flight, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said. Buran had flown twice around <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on fully automatic control, then landed at the special 2.7-mile concrete runway eight miles from its launch pad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> has successfuly tested its first reusable space craft Buran,'' <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said, interrupting its regular programming. A previous attempt to launch the Buran had been frustrated by last-minute technical troubles. An escort plane followed the shuttle as it approached the runway, tracking the last moments of the flight with special optical and television equipment. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the shuttle systems of the Buran, or snowstorm in Russian, were tested during the completely automated flight. In yellow flame and clouds of steam, the delta-winged Buran lifted off on schedule at 6 a.m. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> time -LRB- 10 p.m. EST -RRB- despite a cold rain, indicating there had been no hitches in the automated countdown and launch. The engines of Buran were fired twice about three-quarters of an hour later after it had separated from its booster Energia, and the craft reached orbit exactly on schedule, Soviet media said. There was no live broadcast of the liftoff, but 90 minutes later Soviet television showed its first film. The shuttle, attached to <LOCATION> Energia </LOCATION> and four first-stage rockets, lifted slowly off its pad in the early morning dark. Controllers were shown applauding the launch and green computer screens showed the flight trajectory. The craft's own engines were fired for the first time at an altitude of 99 miles to nudge it into orbit with its left wing facing <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Before liftoff, technicians had been concerned that the Buran and <ORGANIZATION> Energia </ORGANIZATION> might get covered with a coat of ice. `` If the wind rises into a squall and the orbital vehicle -LRB- and -RRB- <LOCATION> Energia </LOCATION> become covered with a crust of ice, then launch time will be changed again,'' said correspondent <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Slipchenko </PERSON>, referring to a failed attempt to launch Buran last month. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials wo n't launch the American space shuttle if there is ice on the booster rocket or orbiter, and cold temperatures contributed to the failure of booster rocket seals that led to the Challenger disaster in January 1986. The radio report said the flight would be long enough to check out all the shuttle systems and determine when a manned flight is feasible. Technicians began fueling the 198-foot <ORGANIZATION> Energia </ORGANIZATION>, the world's most powerful booster, with nearly 2,000 tons of liquid hydrogen, oxygen and kerosene, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday night. Launch had been set for Oct. 29, but the countdown was halted with 51 seconds left when an access arm failed to pull far enough away from the space craft. Officials said Monday they redesigned the joint and expected no more trouble from it. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> flew its first shuttle, the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, in 1981, and for years the Soviets criticized the craft as wasteful and unreliable. But Western space specialists say the Soviets began planning their space plane in 1982 at the latest. Few technical details have been made public about the Buran, a lookalike to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle, and state-run media have only indirectly indicated its cost. `` Comparing the cost of the Buran program and that of the similar <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle program -LRB- $ 10 billion -RRB-, newspapers say they are approximately identical,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The Buran can carry up to 10 cosmonauts, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaev </PERSON>, chief of the commercial Soviet space agency Glavkosmos, told reporters Thursday the maiden flight of the 100-ton Buran will show the Soviets if they are ready to begin manned shuttle missions. The Soviets have cited the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the Challenger, which killed all seven crewmembers aboard, as an example of the hazards they are trying to avoid. <PERSON> Dunaev </PERSON> said the Buran and `` several'' additional shuttles planned by the Soviets will have a different role than their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> equivalents, which were designed to ferry payloads into orbit. The Buran and its sister craft will be used to park satellites in space `` only in exceptional cases,'' <PERSON> Dunaev </PERSON> said, since the use of shuttles for that purpose costs `` tens, even hundreds of times'' more than conventional booster rockets. `` Soviet reusable spaceships will be used, first of all, for the accomplishment of tasks involved in the operation of space technology: maintenance operations and recovery of worn-out satellites,'' he said. The Soviets repeatedly have criticized the military uses of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle, but the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> says the Soviet spacecraft could be used to deploy killer satellites, ballistic missile defense weapons and other military uses. The Energia, which can lift a 220,000-pound payload, rivals the power of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s huge <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> 5 rocket, which was scrapped for economy reasons after taking Apollo crews to the moon.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar firmed against the Japanese yen Tuesday while share prices soared to a record high. The dollar opened at 123.60 yen, and traded in a range of 123.15-123 .72 yen before closing at 123.25 yen, up 0.25 yen from the previous day's close The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which closed at a record 28,520.90 points Monday, gained another 308.51 points, or 1.07 percent, to close at 28,829.41, its highest close ever. Traders said continued intervention by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank early Tuesday morning helped brake the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's recent fall against the yen. The scale of intervention was considered small, but enough to show monetary officials are determined to stem the dollar's slide, they said. The central bank does not publicly comment on its activities, although market sources said that on Monday it bought an estimated $ 500 million in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in an attempt to stem the currency's rapid plunge. Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> told a news conference Tuesday that there would be cooperative intervention with other major monetary nations in the currency market if rates again prove unstable. An exchange dealer with a major commercial bank, speaking anonymously, said market players were keenly awaiting the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monthly trade figures for September, scheduled for Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which closed at a record 28,520.90 points Monday, was up 262.15 points from that close to finish the morning session at 28,783.05. Share prices were broadly higher during the morning session on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, dealers said. `` Large capital issues, including steels and shipbuildings, are heading upward after recent sessions of weakness,'' <PERSON> Seiichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Kita </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> says he was thinking of the Challenger astronauts' families, not about any cover-up concerning the shuttle explosion, when he intervened in a dispute over the astronauts' remains. `` It's the last thing in the wake of an American tragedy -LRB- that -RRB- there should be a bureaucratic turf fight over who's going to possess the remains of the seven dead astronauts,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said Monday. `` That simply was not right in the context of the national tragedy we were all suffering, and it was not right for the families of the seven astronauts. `` If I had to do it all over again, I would do it exactly the same way,'' he said at a news conference. A story published Sunday in The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tropic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Democrat who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>, acted at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s behest in calling <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Medical Examiner <PERSON> Laudie </PERSON> <PERSON> McHenry </PERSON> and telling him to drop his office's contention that the autopsies should be performed by <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION> authorities The article implied <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s actions were part of an alleged <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> cover-up aimed at preventing the public from knowing that the astronauts likely were alive until the Challenger slammed into the ocean on Jan. 28, 1986. Autopsy reports from the county office would have been public record. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> denied the story's report that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbey </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Astronaut Office, called him to ask him to intervene in the autopsy dispute. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said he called Abbey in March 1986 to tell him he thought the dispute was inappropriate and that he would call the <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION> medical examiner. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> on Monday, the wives of Challenger astronauts <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> <PERSON> Onizuka </PERSON> said they were n't surprised to read speculation that crew members may have been alive during the 2 -LCB- - minute free fall into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, but that the Tropic article was distressing `` I think I always felt that <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> was alive because his <ORGANIZATION> PEAP </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- personal emergency air pack -RRB- was found still attached to his seat ... breathed down three-fourths of the way, which was the same amount of time that it would've taken to impact,'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` It was in the on position and it is used only on demand, so he had to be breathing in order to receive the air. I have known in my heart always, I felt strongly that he was alive until that time.'' Added <PERSON> Lorna </PERSON> <PERSON> Onizuka </PERSON>: `` I do n't know if anything was covered up, I hope not. It was an incident that nobody was prepared for ... or how to handle it when it did happen.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, an astronaut aboard the last shuttle mission before Challenger, said the astronauts' remains had been recovered in international waters and taken to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pathology </ORGANIZATION>, and as far as he was concerned a presidential executive order signed in February gave the independent <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> the jurisdiction for all aspects of the Challenger investigation. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said <PERSON> McHenry </PERSON> agreed with him, attributing the dispute to an assistant medical examiner. <PERSON> McHenry </PERSON>'s office said he was unavailable for comment Monday. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials denied they were trying to cover up details of the astronauts' deaths. `` We've made every effort to determine the cause and time of death but have never been able to pin it down,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Atchison </PERSON> said Monday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said that if there were lingering doubts about the Challenger disaster, his subcommittee would hold new hearings. But, he said, the possibility that the astronauts were alive until impact was n't new.

 Following are excerpts of the official English translation of the `` Declaration of Independence,'' which was read in Arabic by <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> today: `` When in the course of modern times a new order of values was declared with norms and values fair for all, it was the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people who were excluded from the destiny of all other peoples by a hostile array of local and foreign powers. ... `` Despite the historical injustice inflicted on the Arab Palestinian people resulting in their dispersion and depriving them of their right to self-determination, following <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> resolution 181 -LRB- 1947 -RRB-, which partitioned <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> into two states, one <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and one Jewish, yet it is this resolution that still provides those conditions of international legitimacy that ensure the right of the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> people to sovereignty and national independence. `` By stages, the occupation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and parts of other Arab territories by Israeli forces, the willed dispossession and expulsion from their ancestral homes of the majority of Palestine's civilian inhabitants was achieved by organized terror Those who remained, as a vestige subjugated in its homeland, were persecuted and forced to endure the destruction of their national life. ... `` The intefadeh -LRB- Arabic for uprising -RRB- has set siege to the mind of official <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which has for too long relied exclusively upon myth and terror to deny Palestinian existence altogether. Because the intefadeh and its revolutionary irreversible impulse, the history of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> has therefore arrived at a decisive juncture. `` In pursuance of resolutions adopted by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> summit conferences and relying on the authority bestowed by international legitimacy as embodied in the resolutions of 1947; `` And in exercise by the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people of their right to self-determination, political independence and sovereignty over their territory. ... `` The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, in the name of God, and in the name of the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people, hereby proclaims the establishment of the state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> on our <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> territory with <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as its capital. `` The state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> is the state of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, wherever they may be. The state is for them to enjoy in it their collective natural and cultural identity, theirs to pursue in it a complete equality of rights. In it will be safeguarded their political and religious beliefs and their human dignity under a democratic parliamentary system, based on freedom of expression and multiple parties. The rights of the minorities will duly be respected by the majority, as minorities must abide by decisions of the majority. Governance will be based on principles of social justice, equality and non-discrimination in public rights of men or women, on the grounds of race, religion, color or sex under the aegis of a constitution which ensures the rule of law and an independent judiciary. `` Thus shall these principles allow no departure from <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>'s age-old spiritual and civilizational heritage of tolerance and religious coexistence `` The state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> is an Arab state, an integral and indivisible part of the Arab nation, at one with that nation in heritage and civilization. ... `` The state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> proclaims its commitment to the principles and purposes of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, and to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It proclaims its commitment as well to the principles and policies of the Non-Aligned Movement. ... `` The state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> herewith declares that it believes in the settlement of regional and international disputes by peaceful means, in accordance with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Charter and resolutions ... `` Therefore, on this blessed day, November 15, 1988, as we stand on the threshold of a new dawn ... we humbly bow to the sacred spirits of our fallen martyrs. ...''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is a 450-member bicameral parliament-in-exile with members selected from <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla factions and professional unions. The council elects the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling 15-man executive committee, sets out the committee's policy, distributes finances to the movement's seven departments and regulates relations with governments and other organizations. In short, it is the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>' supreme decision-making body. The council is led by <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayeh </PERSON>, a 78-year-old Moslem priest who was deported from the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The parliament is supposed to convene annually, but the executive committee may call special sessions for internal, regional or international developments. Another body, the Central Council, meets regularly. Its 70 members, who include the executive committee members, oversee implementation of <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> resolutions. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> council first was formed in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in 1964. After the 1967 war when Israeli took control of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, 100 additional members were added to allow representation of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> area, which had been under Egyptian rule. When east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> was occupied, the council moved to <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, where it drafted the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> charter in 1968. Arab governments endorsed the guerrilla movement as the `` sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people'' in a summit the same year. After <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> signed the Camp David peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1979, the council moved out of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. Since then, the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> has held sessions in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. There are independent council members and those designated by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions and unions such as those representing students, lawyers and women. Independents occupy 199 seats. The rest are distributed to the 10 unions and guerrilla factions. Council decisions also are made by majority vote. Fatah, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s largest faction which is headed by <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, has 55 seats, the largest block in the council.

 Soviet officials, who once criticized the American space shuttle as wasteful and unreliable, joined the shuttle business today with a craft that looks conspiciously like its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> predecessor. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency even acknowledged similarities between the crafts after its space plane, the Buran, made its maiden unmanned flight today. `` In appearance the Buran resembles the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle, which has the same streamlined forms and double-delta wing _ the laws of aerodynamics are international,'' it said. Despite the similarity in appearance and design, however, the Soviets seem to have settled on different uses for their shuttle, named the Buran, which is Russian for snowstorm. For years, the Soviets would n't even admit they were developing their own shuttle, though Western specialists date the program back to at least 1982. In June 1980, 10 months before the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> launched its first shuttle, the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the chief of Soviet cosmonaut training, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatalov </PERSON>, said Soviet officials `` consider that the employment of these spacecraft is not justified for Soviet research because present tasks can be solved with the well-tested methods in an economical way.'' Former cosmonaut <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feoktistov </PERSON>, writing in 1984 in a Soviet newspaper, praised the American shuttle as `` an impressive engineering achievement.'' But, he added, `` this system is not sound economically and technologically.'' Soviet officials appeared to become believers after settling on a different focus for their shuttle than the one <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> chose. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle was designed primarily to ferry satellites into orbit. But <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunayev </PERSON>, the head of the Soviet space agency Glavkosmos, said in 1987 that shuttles are not as economical as single-use rocket boosters for placing satellites into orbit. In the clearest hint of the Soviet shuttle's purpose, he said such craft are valuable for servicing space stations and satellites and recovering objects from orbit. The reasoning seems sound because ever since they pioneered space flight with the 1957 launch of Sputnik, the Soviets have forged a proven track record for launching satellites on single-use rockets. They put up more than 150 satellites a year, more than any other country. In addition, the Soviets have concentrated on maintaining a permanent manned presence in space aboard the orbiting space station Mir. While Soviet officials have not said whether the shuttle is capable of doing so, the shuttle might be able to ferry supplies and cosmonauts to Mir. The Buran might also have the capability to retrieve and repair potentially dangerous satellites in orbit. The Soviets have repeatedly criticized the military use of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> shuttle, and the next American flight, of the Atlantis in late November, is a mission for the Pentagon. But as with the American shuttle, the Soviets might use the Buran for military missions. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the Soviet shuttle could be used to deploy anti-satellite and ballistic missile defense weapons. It is n't clear whether the Soviets will try to market their shuttle's services to foreign customers, as they have done with their <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> rocket boosters. If foreign customers are sought, competition will come not only from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> hopes to have its version of the shuttle, the <ORGANIZATION> Hermes </ORGANIZATION>, on the launch pad in the late 1990s. The Buran clearly has advantages over its <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cousin. Its separate booster rocket, the <ORGANIZATION> Energia </ORGANIZATION>, is powered only by liquid fuels, which can be extinguished in an emergency. It has no solid-fuel boosters like the one that failed on the Challenger, killing seven crewmembers. In addition, the Soviet shuttle can use jet engines in its tail, giving it more maneuverability in landing than its American counterpart. The Buran can also carry far heavier payloads than the American shuttle. Energia can hoist more than 100 tons, and the orbiter itself can carry about 66,000 pounds. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle can carry about 55,000 pounds. While Soviet officials maintain they did not copy the American shuttle, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has a different view. `` By using <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> propulsion, computer, materials and airframe technology and design, the Soviets were able to produce an orbiter years earlier, and at far less cost, than if they had depended solely on their own technology and engineering,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in its 1988 report Soviet Military Power.

 A private Latin American collector paid nearly $ 25 million at auction for an early <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> painting of a mother kissing her son's upturned face, setting a record for a 20th century work of art. `` Maternity,'' from the artist's blue period, sold Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Christie </ORGANIZATION>'s for twice its estimate, making it the third-highest price ever paid for a work of art, behind <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Irises'' and `` Sunflowers.'' The 1901 oil on canvas was one of 28 post-Impressionist and modern works on sale from the collection of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> motion picture executive, and his wife <PERSON> Edith </PERSON>, the daughter of film mogul, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>. The 28 lots, all of which sold, fetched $ 85,024,500 _ a record for a single owner's sale at auction. `` This may well be the sale of the century,'' said <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s president <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burge </PERSON>, who presided over the auction `` Tonight's auction was ripe for success _ unsurpassingly beautiful works of art, a fiercely competitive market, and a renowned provenance,'' he said. Earlier, <PERSON> Burge </PERSON> had predicted that the sale would fetch about $ 50 million. The Goetzes built their collection _ generally considered one of the best of its kind _ during the 1940s and 1950s. Until this summer, their paintings hung in their <LOCATION> Holmby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> mansion in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where the couple once entertained lavishly. He died in 1969; she died in June at the age of 82. After intense bidding, `` Maternity'' sold to an unidentified Latin American collector, whose winning bid was placed by telephone. The painting was expected to sell for $ 10 million. It depicts a blue-robed mother in a high-backed chair, with a scissors and sewing basket at her feet. The child, standing next to her, has a ball in his hands. The auction house described the painting as a `` majestic, tender but unsentimental affirmation of maternal love.'' `` It's a great, very rare picture,'' <PERSON> Burge </PERSON> said. `` It was a unique opportunity to buy an early blue period picture'' of <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s, who painted it when he was 20, he added. When <PERSON> Burge </PERSON> brought the hammer down on the $ 24.75 million bid, the crowd broke into applause. `` Irises'' sold for $ 53.9 million in November 1987. A few months earlier, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Sunflowers'' sold for $ 39.9 million. The second-highest priced work sold at Monday's auction was <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Monet </PERSON>'s `` The Beach at <LOCATION> Trouville </LOCATION>,'' an 1870 oil on canvas, which went for $ 10.78 million. The third-highest priced piece was <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Degas </PERSON>' `` Little Dancer At 14 Years,'' a statue that sold for $ 10,175,000, a new record for the artist. The statue depicts a dancer in polychromed bronze; she wears a muslin skirt and her hair is tied with a satin ribbon. Eight artist's records were set during the auction; they were for <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, <PERSON> Degas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Fantin-Latour </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurencin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Soutine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Vuillard </PERSON>. All prices include a 10 percent commission paid by the buyer to the auction house.

 Community leaders and civil rights activists expressed outrage at the beating death of a black man by white youths believed to be `` skinheads,'' and one group called on citizens to take direct action. Sunday's slaying was the nation's third linked to the bands of young toughs who promote white supremacy. Skinheads, whose name is derived from their shaved heads, have been linked to numerous criminal acts against blacks, Asians, Jews and homosexuals nationwide. Two other black men were injured in the attack by three young men, who had shaved heads and wore military jackets. The three victims were Ethiopian immigrants. Mayor <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said in a statement Monday he was `` saddened and disturbed'' by the beatings, and urged citizens and public officials to find a constructive solution to racial violence. `` A cowardly act against any one of our citizens is a cowardly act against every one of our citizens,'' City Commissioner <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` But let us not react out of hatred. Let us react with love and understanding.'' The militant <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> mailed letters to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> synagogues asking them to arm their congregations. `` Violence will be met with violence,'' said <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, head of the 3,000-member group based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said a $ 10,000 reward was being offered for information about the beatings, or to anyone who physically restrains a neo-Nazi from doing violence against a minority group. Police spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said Monday that investigators had no leads in finding the men who attacked <PERSON> Mulugeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON>, 27, <PERSON> Wondwosen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tesfaye </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> Tilahule </PERSON> <PERSON> Antneh </PERSON>, 31. He said they may be skinheads. <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON> was pronounced dead at <ORGANIZATION> Emanuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where the two survivors were treated and released. <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>'s African community planned a memorial service for <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON>, who emigrated from <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> seven years ago and worked at a car rental agency. `` This is really kind of sad, for somebody to be looking for someone with dark skin,'' said <PERSON> Abdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, who teaches a course on southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Portland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` No one is safe, really, and it's a scary thought.'' About 2,000 skinheads are active in 21 states, according to a report issued last month by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, which surveys race - or religion-motivated crimes The <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Malicious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harassment </ORGANIZATION> last month identified <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> as a `` hotbed'' of skinhead activity. In <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, skinheads have been linked to various acts of vandalism and at least two assaults, including the beating of an Asian man in March. <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> and the Northwest are ripe for such activity because so few members of minority groups live here, said <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Brame </PERSON>, executive assistant for the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. The Northwest has been targeted by white supremacist groups as the site for an Aryan `` homeland.'' Asked if <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> police were tracking skinhead activity, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> would say only that the police intelligence unit `` is aware of some of their activities.'' `` Being a gang member is n't against the law. We deal with people who violate the law,'' he said. <PERSON> Antneh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tesfaye </PERSON> told police they were dropping <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON> off at his apartment in a primarily white neighborhood early Sunday when three men and two women pulled up in a car. The three men beat <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON> with a baseball bat and kicked him, <PERSON> Antneh </PERSON> said, and beat the other two when they tried to intervene. He said the attack lasted no more than two minutes. `` The women inside the car were shouting. They were saying ` Let's kill him Kick him,''' <PERSON> Antneh </PERSON> told The Oregonian newspaper. `` They -LRB- the men -RRB- never said anything. They just jumped us.'' Skinheads were suspected in the beating death last December of a 41-year-old black man in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and the stabbing death in February of a 24-year-old white man who took a black friend to a party in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>State Attorney General Seeks Enforcement Of Insurance-Cutting
Proposition</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A ballot question that cuts insurance rates 20 percent should take effect while the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> considers insurance industry lawsuits seeking to void it, says state Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters passed Proposition 103 last week, but lawsuits filed immediately by insurance companies claim the rate rollback for car, home and business insurance is unconstitutional. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> asked the court Monday to withdraw the order it issued last Thursday blocking enforcement of the initiative. Residents who voted for the proposition believed they would see immediate insurance rate relief, he said in papers filed with the court. `` That expectation should not be frustrated without giving the initiative a fair chance to work,'' he said. The attorney general's brief said insurers are unlikely to win their suits against the initiative and have not shown that they would suffer `` irreparable injury'' if Proposition 103 were allowed to take effect while the insurance suits were pending. But if the court did not want to go as far as withdrawing its order, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said, it should let all Proposition 103's provisions take effect except for the rate rollback and require insurance companies to set aside enough money to lower their premiums if they lose their case Members of Voter Revolt, a group that backed Proposition 103, said Monday they did n't have enough money to enter the case now but were starting a fund-raising drive to pay for a later court intervention. Proposition 103, which was fiercely opposed by insurers and passed by a narrow margin, requires insurance rates to be reduced to 20 percent below their November 1987 level. It also requires a freeze at that level until November 1989, when auto insurance rates would be cut an additional 20 percent for motorists with good driving records. In addition, the measure includes an exemption from the rollback for insurers who could show a `` substantial threat of insolvency,'' and conversion of the state insurance commissioner from an appointed to an elected office in 1990. The measure allows the insurance commissioner to consider an insurer's financial situation in granting exemptions from the 20 percent rollback and in reviewing future rate increase applications. Insurance companies argue that the rollback violates their constitutional property rights by denying them the ability to make a fair profit. Insurers spent at least $ 60 million fighting Proposition 103 and other rate reduction initiatives on the ballot and promoting an unsuccessful no-fault auto insurance initiative. It was the most costly state proposition fight in the nation's history. Since the election, several insurers said they would no longer do business in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. In the latest announcement, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the state's largest home and auto insurer, said it has stopped issuing new policies in the state. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it would become the third major insurer in two years to stop writing new auto insurance policies in that state, where insurers say strict regulation of rates prevents them from making a profit. <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 115 million in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> over the past five years, largely as a result of the `` unique regulatory environment'' for auto insurance, said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> division

 Defeated presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, declaring he is `` back and rarin' to go,'' acknowledged his state faces financial problems but denied they were aggravated by his 20-month campaign. `` We face major challenges,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a jammed news conference on Monday, promising to balance the current $ 11.6 billion state budget when the fiscal year ends next June. As he did on the campaign trail, he refused to rule out new state taxes. But, he said, `` I hope we can avoid them.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> admitted that the presidential race `` took some of my attention away,'' but he said other states are facing the same fiscal problems. `` I'm back and rarin' to go,'' he added. During his conference at the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Statehouse </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared rested after his first weekend of rest in months. The defeated Democrat ducked reporters' questions about his political future. `` It's too early to tell. I'm back at a job I love. I'm challenged by it,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, promising to make a decision on his plans `` sometime next year. Last Wednesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a day-after news conference to assess his unsuccessful campaign. At the time, he said he planned to continue the fight for the national agenda his campaign stressed, but he would not speculate on a possible second run for the presidency in 1992. On the campaign trail, President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> challenged <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' credentials as a fiscal manager by brandishing a copy of a tabloid <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> newspaper featuring a front-page story on the state's borrowing to pay its bills under the banner headline `` What a Mess! <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refused to characterize the state's fiscal condition and declined to specify the size of the shortfall in the current $ 11.6 billion budget. Moments later, however, his top budget official testified at a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> oversight hearing and admitted that the state is lacking at least $ 282 million. `` We are in a very difficult two-year period here,'' the governor said, citing the continuing impact on state finances of federal tax changes. He said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and other states were facing similar problems.

 Addressing the annual meeting of the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> criticized its members for not doing more to pressure <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> into democratic reforms. `` This organization has not always been out front on issues concerning democracy,'' he said in the meetings' keynote speech. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government had promised the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> it would maintain a `` pluralistic'' political system, but that member states had not held the Nicaraguans to their commitment. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s vice-minister of foreign affairs, disagreed. `` The general movement is towards discussion, towards negotiation,'' he said during an informal press conference. `` The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> has started to take a political role in ending the Central American crisis.'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> noted that Secretary-General <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> has agreed to a direct role in monitoring a now-stalled peace agreement between the leftist Sandinista government and U.S.-backed Contra rebels. The meeting took place under strict security despite a unilateral truce declared for the duration of the session by leftist Salvadoran guerrillas opposed to the government of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, in welcoming the delegates, condemned the guerrillas and called for support for the overall Central American peace process, Other topics discussed at the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> included Latin American debt, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern with drug trafficking and the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>'s own financial straits The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> is nearly bankrupt because most member nations are behind on their dues. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which provides the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, owes $ 41 million. `` The member governments must decide what they want to do with the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> at this critical juncture in the life of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, lamenting the organization's `` critical economic condition.'' The Brazilian was re-elected by acclamation to a second five-year term as OAS secretary-general. An <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> commission has recommended that the group cut its $ 66 million annual budget by 30 percent and fire a fourth of about 1,000 staff members. Delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> will decide whether to accept that recommendation this week. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who will be replaced by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> when President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes office in January, said he would press for full funding by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> failure to pay its full contribution has been interpreted by some Latin nations as an effort to reassert its dominance over the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>'s original sin is that it was founded to further <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aims in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said. `` But other countries are trying to contribute a little more.'' <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON>, a Contra spokesman who came to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to press the rebels' case, questioned <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>'s motives. `` They want negotiations on a biblical time scale _ to last a thousand years,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` They only want to stretch things out to reinforce their grip.'' At a news conference after his speech, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> pointed to the exclusion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> from a meeting of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations last month as an example of the kind of diplomatic sanction that could be taken by <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> nations. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> noted pointedly, was excluded from the `` Group of Eight'' because it was no longer a democracy while under Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s thumb.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> declared a tongue-in-cheek promo `` war'' on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s mammoth World War II miniseries, `` War and Remembrance,'' but were nevertheless relieved and surprised when its first night did n't do as well as expected. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> expressed disappointment in the prelminary ratings for Sunday's opening episode, even though the first installment of the 18-hour, seven-part first half of the $ 110 million miniseries won the night. It only got a 34 share _ or percentage of the viewing audience _ compared to the 53 share for `` The Winds of War'' in 1983. `` War and Remembrance,'' based on <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Wouk </PERSON>'s novel, is a sequel to `` The Winds of War.'' `` We're a little surprised at the first night's viewing levels, but it's quality viewing at its finest, and we're very proud of it,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Gretemeyer </PERSON> said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> estimated 50 million people watched the opening installment. Another 14 hours or so of `` War and Remembrance'' will run on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> sometime next year. The length of the miniseries was a target of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s and CBS' counter-advertising. An <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> promo asked viewers to weigh `` a World War II movie that does n't end'' against <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s lighter fare, including a TV movie starring <PERSON> Vanna </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. `` The tricky thing is you do n't want to use your airwaves to hype something on another network in order to say there's an alternative. We have a couple of spots that we've held back on,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON>. One of those he described as similar to the old Alka-Seltzer commercials in which gorged Americans marveled, `` I ca n't believe I ate the whole thing.'' `` Do n't be a prisoner of war in your own living room,'' said a CBS ad that promoted <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> stars. `` I think there are things you can get away with, with humor,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Schweitzer </PERSON>. `` We were not disparaging the competition, and we will never belittle or disparage the competition. But tongue-in-cheek humor is acceptable when it works.'' The first part of the epic miniseries was rushed on the air this month because the writers' strike delayed production on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s new series. In the 17 largest TV markets, `` War and Remembrance'' had a rating of 23.8 on Sunday night. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> ran the hit theatrical movie `` Back to the Future'' and got an 18.1 and a 26 share. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had an 11.4 and 16 with a made-for-TV comedy Western, `` Where the Hell's the Gold? The 18-hour `` The Winds of War'' averaged a 38.6 rating. The rating is a percentage of all homes with televisions in the markets measured. The share is a percentage of sets in use. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> executives said last month that the network stands to lose $ 20 million on the miniseries even if it gets the ratings the network guaranteed to sponsors. If it does n't meet the guarantee, the network will lose additional money by having to provide free advertising to make up the difference. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> wo n't say what the guaranteed rating was. The network was hamstrung by author <PERSON> Wouk </PERSON>'s contractual limitations on the amount and type of advertising that <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> could run during the miniseries. <PERSON> Wouk </PERSON> was concerned about inappropriate juxtaposition of some type of commercials with the miniseries' graphic concentration camps scenes The unexpectedly low rating for `` War and Remembrance'' can be ascribed in part to <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>'s new measurement system that tends to produce lower ratings generally, but probably owes more to a general trend away from network viewing, a trend that was exacerbated when the writers' strike delayed the networks' new shows and summer reruns extended well into the fall. But network executives have been saying for the past few years that the days of the lengthy, big-event miniseries are probably over. Most miniseries in recent seasons have been no longer than four parts and most have been only two. `` Amerika,'' the last long miniseries at 14 -LCB- hours, also only <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, failed in the ratings two years ago.

 An 11-year-old boy who took a city bus on a seven-block joy ride bailed out of the moving bus before it collided head-on with an automobile, injuring the driver, officials said. The boy, who was charged with juvenile delinquency, was treated for head and eye bruises. The name of the boy was withheld because of his age.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar this morning eased against many foreign currencies in European trading as traders said they were withdrawing from the market ahead of Wednesday's release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for September. Gold prices rose. `` We expect the -LRB- trade -RRB- report to show a gap of $ 10 billion to $ 11 billion,'' said a dealer at a major West German bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. The August <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit was 12.18 billion dollars. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Pemberton </PERSON> said foreign exchange markets were `` unjustified'' in expecting an instant response or meeting from the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized nations in the aftermath of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential elections. <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Pemberton </PERSON> said in an interview broadcast on the Zurich-based <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> that he does not favor a lower dollar. He said there has been no change in the <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION>'s policy of stable exchange rates since the group last met in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in September. `` The policy statement that flowed from our most recent meeting is still valid and in my opinion there has been no change from the stance expressed in that statement,'' he said. `` There was no reason why the dollar should be talked down and it would be better if it should n't go down.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.25 yen to close at 123.25. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 123.45 yen.

 The arrival of <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION>, wheels clicking and whistle sounding, marked the return of passenger service between <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> after more than 30 years and put the `` station'' back in this city's name. The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> stopped briefly for ceremonies in College Station-Bryan and in <LOCATION> Corsicana </LOCATION>, along its 265-mile route Monday from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Passenger service for the public begins today. About 500 people watched the train arrive at a temporary depot at the stop some 80 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Band </PERSON> performed Mexican mariachi music in the lounge for the inaugural run. For the special trip, <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> included its ceremonial office car on the train as its caboose.

 A <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> couple whose dog disappeared last week were reunited with the hound after it was pictured in news reports with Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. `` The governor's very happy that the dog is back with its owners,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bray </PERSON> said Monday. `` Anybody who owns a dog knows the heartsick feeling when the dog leaves the yard for any extended period.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> had decided Sunday to keep the black-and-tan coon hound after troopers found it Friday tied to a gate of the Governor's Mansion with a note that read: `` Please give pup a good home, we ca n't We will miss him dearly, please take care of him.'' The governor, who already has two dogs, named his new-found pet Trooper in honor of the state police guards who found him. <PERSON> Bray </PERSON> speculated that when the dog left its owners' home, it may have come into the hands of someone else, who left it at the mansion rather than taking it to an animal shelter. `` Maybe they thought there would be plenty of room at the mansion,'' he said. The dog's owners asked not to be identified, <PERSON> Bray </PERSON> said, but there was no doubt that it was their pet. One of the owners described the 4-year-old dog in detail, including a scar on its right ear and a scar on its left hip.

<DATELINE>TONASKET, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 12-year-old girl who survived by playing dead after she was shot, beaten and left in a burning house is `` one of the bravest, strongest little girls I know,'' says the county sheriff. The girl, <PERSON> Brook </PERSON> <PERSON> Rottinghaus </PERSON>, finally sneaked from the burning house, which contained the bodies of her mother and stepfather, and was able to get help early Sunday, authorities said. <LOCATION> Okanogan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Weed </PERSON> said the girl awoke about 2 a.m. Sunday to the sound of gunfire. She called downstairs from the loft where she slept and a man she later identified as <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullens </PERSON> told her the noise was a propane stove popping, Weed said. Weed said the child saw her mother double over from a wound to the abdomen. The man then climbed the stairs leading to the loft, shot the girl, kicked her in the face and went back downstairs and started two fires, police said. <PERSON> Brook </PERSON> went downstairs and hid, but the man found her, pulled her into the living room, and kicked her in the face again. `` When she landed that time, she played dead with fires going on each side of her,'' Weed said. <PERSON> Brook </PERSON> apparently waited a few minutes to be sure the man would not come back, then ran about a quarter mile through snow in the rural area in north-central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for help. `` This little gal was just exceptionally brave and had unbelievable presence of mind in dealing with this situation,'' Weed said. The girl was listed in good condition today at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tonasket </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Okanogan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Undersheriff <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>. He said she was shot in the upper right arm, then the bullet grazed her chest and struck her upper left arm. The girl's father joined her from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, authorities said. <PERSON> Sullens </PERSON>, 25, was arrested Sunday night at his apartment in <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>. He remained in jail early today, but no charges had been filed, authorities said. Killed were <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Glanville </PERSON>, 45, and his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, 40. Weed said police did not have a motive for the shootings, but added that the suspect was being questioned and was cooperative. `` We feel really bad,'' Weed said. `` It's so bizarre and she lost so much.'' He said police have visited the girl at the hospital, and some have taken teddy bears. `` I spent an hour with her. She's pretty upset but I do n't think the shock has hit her yet,'' Weed said. Sheriff's deputies say <PERSON> Sullens </PERSON>, a martial arts expert, had purchased a tae kwon do studio near <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION> from the Glanvilles and had been to their home once before. <LOCATION> Tonasket </LOCATION> is a town of 1,000 residents about 20 miles from the Canadian border.

<HEAD>Police Chief: Abortion Activists Must Pay Costs Of Protest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The 102 anti-abortion activists arrested for trying to block the doors of a women's clinic may end up paying the Police Department for costs incurred in handling the protest, the police chief said. Police Chief <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerwens </PERSON> said Monday he had asked City Prosecutor <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> to try to recover the estimated $ 3,800 the Nov. 4 protest cost the department. `` They chose civil disobedience to make a point and they should be willing to pay the consequences,'' <PERSON> Gerwens </PERSON> said. `` They planned on being arrested.'' Demonstrators planted themselves before the entrance to the Sigma Women's Center, which advertises abortions, waiting to carried to paddy wagons and booked on trespassing charges. It took 26 <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> police officers, plus eight from nearby <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, to quell the disturbance, <PERSON> Gerwens </PERSON> said. In addition to the officers' time, police cars had to be diverted from their assigned zones to handle the protest. Other costs included transportation, two portable toilets, film for booking prisoners, an emergency medical truck and an ambulance, he said. <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion organization Rescue <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, which was among several groups at the protest, called the plan to seek reimbursement unfair. Ms. <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, whose 13-year-old daughter was among those arrested, said the demonstration `` was not for the purpose of getting arrested or getting publicity. Our main reason was to save babies and save women from being exploited.'' All those arrested were charged with trespassing, and all but one were immediately released and given notice to appear in court. <PERSON> Gerwens </PERSON> said that by seeking reimbursement, the city was not taking a position on the protest, only that taxpayers should not have to pay for a deliberate disturbance. He said the department will further pursue the idea of making those convicted of a crime pay the police costs involved.

The storm left snow in the mountains of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Monday and battered the region with high winds and rain, downing tree limbs and power lines. A rogue wave in seas churned up by the storm swept over a jetty next to <LOCATION> Morro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, 180 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, killing two fishermen, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Morro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

In <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a 17-year-old girl died Monday when she lost control of her car on a snow-slickened road and it slid into the path of a school bus. In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, strong winds accompanying the snow created near-blizzard conditions in some areas.

 <LOCATION> ALGIERS </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> _ The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile proclaims an independent Palestinian state, approving a new, moderate political program that indirectly recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renounces terrorism. The move, a victory for moderates in the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, is largely symbolic but could add impetus to <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> efforts to achieve self-rule. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s leaders oppose a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, and authorities said they would quash unilateral Palestinian steps toward self-rule.

<HEAD>Teacher Will Not Be Disciplined For Prison Simulation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A high school teacher will not be disciplined for arranging a field trip in which students were strip-searched, hog-tied and forced to eat fish-head soup in a simulation of Third World prison conditions, officials said. `` Some of the learning activities that were conducted went beyond what was really necessary to accommodate the objectives of the program,'' said <PERSON> Denie </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Wheaton-Warrenville </LOCATION> school district, at a school board meeting Monday. Superintendent <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> `` supports the program, the prison simulation,'' she said. `` The administration just feels that parts of it were carried to an extreme.'' Last month's voluntary field trip to <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> by 34 juniors and seniors from <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> was intended to give students a taste of criminal-justice systems, included one that might exist in a Third World country ruled by a despot. The field trip included strip-searches, a meal of potato soup with a fish head floating in it, blindfolds, handcuffs and nude `` duck-walking'' involving some of the boys, Ms. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. The students who participated had no complaints, but afterward, some parents said they were outraged by the field trip, and the school board asked <PERSON> Short </PERSON> to evaluate the program. <PERSON> Short </PERSON> told about 50 parents that there would be no disciplinary action against <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> teacher <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliphant </PERSON>, a popular American government instructor who arranged the field trip. But <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said the consent form parents were asked to sign was inadequate. `` We would want to see to it that the communication with parents would be a lot more effective'' in the future, he said. `` There was a need for parents to have a greater understanding of what they were signing.'' The field trip was supervised by <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Smarto </PERSON>, director of the college's <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION>, who acted as the `` warden.''

Gorbachev comments. Picks up 10th pvs, `Buran separated ...'
^By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviet space shuttle Buran orbited the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> twice today and landed eight miles from its launch pad in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, ending with flawless precision its unmanned 3-hour, 25-minute maiden flight. The successful flight puts the Soviets into the shuttle program alongside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A major success for the Soviet space program, it comes after a series of problems including the near loss of cosmonauts on a joint Soviet-Afghan mission to the Mir space station in September. The Buran, snowstorm in Russian, touched down on a 2.8-mile concrete runway with a puff of dust from its rear wheels and rolled to a halt as three parachutes opened at its rear. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> has successfully tested its first reusable space craft Buran,'' official <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said, interrupting regular programming two minutes after touchdown. The flight originally was scheduled for Oct. 29, but computers stopped that countdown with only 51 seconds left when an access arm failed to pull far enough away from the rocket. Officials said they had since redesigned the joint. Within 30 minutes of today's landing, Soviet television showed the fully automated approach and touchdown of the delta-winged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle look-alike in the middle of the barren, brown steppe. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said the flight, which had been in jeopardy because of cold, rainy weather, went according to schedule, and all on-board tests were completed. Pointing to the January 1986 explosion of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle Challenger that killed its seven crewmembers, Soviet officials say they will not make a manned flight until all the shuttle's systems are fully tested in unmanned flight. They have not said when that might be. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, informed of the flight's success, said the flight was `` one more confirmation of the kind of huge possibilities the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has to solve any problem.'' Buran separated as planned from the liquid fuel <ORGANIZATION> Energia </ORGANIZATION> booster minutes after it lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in a flame of yellow, with clouds of white steam lighting up the early morning sky. About three-quarters of an hour later, Buran's own engines fired twice at an altitude of 99 miles, nudging the craft into its two orbits. Television film shot from a jet aircraft showed the shuttle's dark silhouette against a pale blue-gray sky as it approached the landing site, then switched to closer shots as the shuttle landed like an aircraft The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said as it prepared to re-enter the atmosphere, the shuttle turned its tail forward, and switched on a retrofire engine. At an altitude of 24 miles, the craft turned again and began its approach like an airplane. The weather service in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> reported that it had been raining in Baikonur three hours before the launch, and the temperature was 39 degrees. The weather at the exact launch time was not known. Soviet television said the launch was in jeopardy because of rising wind and the danger of ice coating the shuttle and its booster. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials will not launch the American space shuttle if there is ice on the booster rocket or orbiter and cold temperatures contributed to the failure of booster rocket seals that led to the Challenger disaster, which halted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle program for 2 -LCB- years. The last <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle mission began Sept. 29, and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> plans to announce its next launch date on Wednesday. Soviet space officals have said their ability to control the shuttle entirely from the ground makes it safer than the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle program. And after the Soviet shuttle program begins in earnest, fully automated ground control will allow cosmonauts more time for scientific research, they say. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> flew its first shuttle, the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, in 1981, and for years the Soviets criticized the craft as wasteful and unreliable. But Western space specialists say the Soviets began planning and building their space plane in 1982 at the latest. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Buran is 36 yards long and has a wing span of 24 yards. Like the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle, it is covered with 38,000 heat-proof ceramic tiles to protect it from the searing heat of reentry. Soviet officials say their shuttle has a bigger payload capacity than the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle, and that several more are under construction. It can hold up to 10 cosmonauts and mission specialists. But the Soviet officials say only two to four flights are planned yearly, and that the Soviet space program still will depend on single-use spacecraft for the bulk of its work in the cosmos, including putting satellites into orbit.

<HEAD>Shamir Invites Peres To Coalition Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, entrusted with forming <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s next government, said today that he will try to coax the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> into his rightist-religious coalition. Labor leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> accepted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s invitation to attend coalition talks today, but expressed doubts his party would join a Shamir-led government. Labor and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc are sharply divided on how to end the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> issued his invitation to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> after being told by President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> that the president's office had been flooded with thousands of calls urging a <ORGANIZATION> Labor-Likud </ORGANIZATION> government. `` I said many times that I prefer a broad-based government including the two large parties,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television. `` I'm looking for a way to bring this about.'' A unity government would blunt the power of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s other coalition partners _ four religious parties that seek to impose changes on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s secular majority and three extreme right-wing parties that demand annexation of the occupied lands. `` The public is worried. There is a wish for unity to confront the dangers from outside and the separation threatening us from within,'' <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> told <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Monday after asking him to form the next government. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has six weeks to form a ruling coalition, and is expected to get the needed 61-seat majority in the 120-member Parliament. In the Nov. 1 elections, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won 40 seats, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> 39 and the religious parties 18, putting the smaller parties in the position of kingmaker. In issuing his invitation to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> ruled out an equal partnership such as the uneasy one formed between <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> after the inconclusive elections of 1984. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also hinted Labor could help formulate a peace strategy if it joined the government. But <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> appeared skeptical. `` I do n't think there are many chances for it -LRB- a national unity government -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio without elaborating. Labor's secretary general, <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Baram </PERSON>, said his party would not accept a junior position and demanded parity in the distribution of Cabinet posts, including senior jobs for <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and Labor's No. 2, Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>. But <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> as saying Labor should join the new government even as a junior partner to prevent a narrow rightist-religious coalition.

 The Israeli Foreign Ministry today rejected a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declaration of independence for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> as `` double talk.'' Similarly, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> rejected the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> announcement of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state as another step in the `` war by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> terror organizations'' to destroy the Jewish state. Despite moderate language implictly recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> document approved Monday in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> was also rejected by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, leader of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is no chance ... that any declaration of theirs will be accepted before negotiations,'' said <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. `` Our problem now is not solving the Palestinian issue but how to open negotiations because without negotiations there will be no solution to the problem.'' Hours after the declaration was announced, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s official response came in a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement that criticized the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> declaration as `` double talk'' employed to excuse <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> support for violence and terror. `` No gimmick can mask the tragedy inflicted upon the Palestinian people time and again by the absence of reasonable, realistic and peace-seeking leadership,'' said the statement, which called on other nations not to recognize the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> state. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, addressing his remarks to Palestinians in the occupied territories, predicted there would be `` political war'' with the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> over international recognition of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> state. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> have already recognized the Palestinian state declared in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. `` This is not the way to a life of peace, security and coexistence with the Jewish people in the land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. `` This is another step in the war of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> terror organizations against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s existence and independence and we shall respond accordingly.'' Both <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spoke at the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> communal farm of <LOCATION> Sde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boker </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders gathered to pay tribute to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s first prime minister, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Gurion </PERSON>, on the 15th anniversary of his death Left-wing Israelis welcomed the more moderate language of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the declaration's recognition of the Jewish state. But hard-line politicians called for annexation or a massive drive to settle Jews in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> where 1.5 million Arabs and 70,000 Israels live. Trade Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, a leading member of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, called the declaration a `` dangerous development'' and said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should assert its claim by annexing part of the occupied land in response He said the security situation in the occupied lands could further deterioriate. At least 312 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have been killed in the 11-month uprising. In an interview with the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> called for negotiations under the U.S.-Soviet sponsorship as an alternative to a U.N.-sponsored international conference favored by the Arabs. Negotiations would take place with Egyptian, Jordanian and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegations but not the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> reported. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s major dailies headlined the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s new political program announced in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, focusing on its acceptance of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 242 that implicitly recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

 The leader of southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s rebels has agreed to a cease-fire in his 5 -LCB- - year rebellion and to allow relief to reach starving war refugees, the official <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported today In return, the agency said, renegade army Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> expects a national state of emergency to be lifted and a constitutional conference convened. The agreement was reported in dispatches from the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, where it was to be signed today, and from <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. It does not commit the government, but Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> gave the talks his blessing and said he would follow up on any agreements reached. <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> negotiated the agreement with <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirghani </PERSON>, patriarch of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the second partner in <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s governing coalition. <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> organized the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in early 1983 and began his fight for southern autonomy and political, economic and administrative reforms. Then-President <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>'s proclamation of Islamic law exacerbated the war six months later, and <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> has vowed not to lay down arms until <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s civilian government abrogates <LOCATION> Sharia </LOCATION> Traditionally, the country's Moslem majority dominates the central government. Most of the southerners are Christian or animist. Relief workers say the accumulated effects of more than five years of war have brought widespread famine to much of the south this year. They estimate that 1.3 million of the region's 6 million inhabitants have fled this year alone, with starvation killing more than 250,000 people. There was no immediate reaction to the agreement from the government. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Saleh </PERSON> attended the talks as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> leadership. Defense Minister <PERSON> Abdul-Maguid </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaleel </PERSON> has said the military would welcome any peace agreement. `` We are the people most concerned about peace, because we suffer more than the others from war,'' <PERSON> Khaleel </PERSON> said. `` We are with the strategy of peace -LRB- but -RRB- will continue defending the territorial integrity of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>.'' The Addis Ababa talks have drawn fire from another coalition partner, the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which saw them as a ploy to force the Moslem party from the government. Any agreement between <PERSON> Mirghani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> would make future talks involving the government ineffective, the front's political affairs secretary, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Haj </PERSON>, said. The <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> gave few details on the agreement. The agency said <PERSON> Mirghani </PERSON> described his discussions with <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> as `` serious and frank.''

 A pediatricians group is calling on parents to restrict the time their children spend watching rock-music videos because the images contain too many depictions of sexism, violence and drug use. The American <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that it rejects censorship, but called on producers and programmers to demonstrate `` good taste'' in their choice of the images shown in videos on television. `` Music videos may represent a new art form, but we believe it is one that contains an excess of sexism, violence, substance abuse, suicides and sexual behavior,'' the academy said in a statement. Dr. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasburger </PERSON>, an author of the statement, said the academy is not against rock music, but listening to rock is one thing, and watching images on television is another. `` Teen-agers who may not hear or understand rock lyrics can not avoid the often disturbing images that characterize a growing number of videos,'' the academy said. The 34,000-member academy is based in suburban <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kluger </PERSON> defended his music video cable channel, saying all videos are screened for their depictions of women, children and drug and alcohol abuse before being allowed on the channel. <PERSON> Kluger </PERSON> said he agreed with the academy that parents should more actively control what is watched by their children. `` We're not urging parents to use <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> as a baby sitter,'' he said. <PERSON> Strasburger </PERSON> said the doctors are concerned about the number of women who are sexually abused, adding that `` we ca n't show small children images where women are being raped or chained or beat up.'' And that is what happens in rock videos, he said. With one study finding that 75 percent of the music videos telling a story contain sexually suggestive material, and 56 percent of them containing violence, often against women. <PERSON> Strasburger </PERSON> said parents should watch music videos with their children to influence the children's reaction to the images. The academy has also criticized soap operas, prime-time situation comedies, children's programming and commercials for displaying `` unhealthy images,'' <PERSON> Strasburger </PERSON> said.

 American females born today can expect to live healthier, longer lives than those born a quarter century ago, but the AIDS epidemic and limited access to the health care system pose a serious threat, says a status report on today's woman. Citing recent surveys and national statistics, the study suggests that although women make up a small proportion of those who have been diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome since the beginning of the deadly epidemic, women are the fastest growing group of people with AIDS. A separate study on women's health care notes that of the 37 million Americans without health insurance, women are most vulnerable. The poverty rate is higher among women, especially older women, and they must rely on inadequate public programs, the study said. Women classified as non-poor are less likely to work than men and therefore are less likely to be covered by an employer's health insurance plan. The studies are contained in `` The American Woman 1988-89: A Status Report,'' a 443-page collection addressing issues ranging from the presence of women in politics to basic health care to women's progress in law enforcement. The report was prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Education Institution and was being released today. The women's organization considers the report a challenge to the new administration of President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In a chapter devoted to AIDS, the study cites statistics compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, which found that in the first 11 months of 1987, 1,377 women were diagnosed with the incurable disease _ 8 percent of all AIDS cases reported during that period. The disease that attacks the body's immune system is believed caused by an unusual virus, now called human immunodeficiency virus or HIV. The virus is spread through close contact with blood or semen from infected persons. The disease is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, or infected blood or blood products. The study notes that the Centers for Disease Control estimates there are 50 to 80 times as many women who are infected with HIV as there are women with active cases of AIDS. The status report says that 15 percent of women who acquired AIDS through sexual contact were not aware of their contact's risk factor _ intravenous drug user, bisexual or the recipient of possibly contaminated blood. `` To prevent further spread of the deadly AIDS virus to women and their children, it is imperative both to educate the general public and to mount aggressive, targeted outreach efforts to women at highest risk,'' the report said. The chapter `` Women and Health Care'' said girls born in 1975 can expect to live an average of seven years longer than boys born the same year, but death rates for women from lung cancer have quadrupled and women suffer more than men from infections and respiratory diseases. Life expectancy for women has increased rapidly, however. The life expectancy for females born in 1960 was 73.1 years; for those born in 1985, it was 78.2 years, the report said. The government's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> reported in August that life expectancy for women was 78.3 years as of 1987, the same as the high set the year before. But the most serious problem is access to health care. `` A country as prosperous and ingenious as this one is should not tolerate the great disparities that exist between men and women, between the poor and the non-poor, and between whites and minorities in something so vital and basic as health care,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Police Order Two Americans To Stay After Illegal Trip To Laos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities today ordered two Americans who had illegally crossed into <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> on a search for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prisoners of war to remain in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> pending an investigation of their status. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Copp </PERSON>, both from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, returned to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on Saturday after 41 days of detention in a Laotian jail. The Laotian authorities detained them after they sailed across the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to illegally enter <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. Once in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, they passed out offers of a $ 2.4 million reward for Americans they believe are still being held more than 13 years after the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war ended. When they returned to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, immigration officials at the airport let them through but kept their passports because they did not bear the stamp given when travelers leave <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, said Capt. <PERSON> Apisak </PERSON> <PERSON> Phumsvi </PERSON> of Immigration Police. That delayed the Americans' original plans to leave for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Wednesday. <PERSON> Apisak </PERSON> said immigration commander Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Kriangkrai </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnasuta </PERSON> must approve the Americans' request that the charges of an immigration violation be waived. The process normally takes up to three days, he said. `` Their case is not a serious violation of Thai immigration rules,'' <PERSON> Apisak </PERSON> said. `` We are looking at it as if it were unintentional.'' Miss Long is a 45-year-old writer from <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Copp </PERSON> is a 44-year-old schoolteacher from <LOCATION> Hampstead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. They said they were not physically mistreated in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, but were subjected to interrogations and spent 32 days in solitary confinement. They were released after $ 1,500 in administrative costs was paid to the Laotian government and a veterans group canceled a protest planned at the <ORGANIZATION> Laotian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to demand their release. Miss <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said a police colonel told her that if any other Americans dared enter <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> illegally again, they would be held `` forever, forever.'' The reward the two Americans were trying to publicize was pledged by 21 <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Congressmen and some private citizens. <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> has repeatedly denied it is holding any Americans from the war. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday praised the release of Miss Long and <PERSON> Copp </PERSON>. But its spokeswoman, <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, said: `` We reiterate our conviction that government-to-government cooperation is the way to resolve the the POW-MIA -LRB- prisoner of war - missing in action -RRB- issue ... and that reward offers are counterproductive to this ongoing effort. There are 547 Americans listed as MIA in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>.

 Warnings about a rapidly spreading computer virus have been issued to students at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northridge </ORGANIZATION>, following reports the virus is disrupting functions of Macintosh computers. `` In general, this thing is spreading like mad,'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sales </PERSON>, the university's computer center consultant, said Monday. `` It originated in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, found its way to <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> and in a short time infected us here.'' School officials say at least a dozen of the Macintosh computers at the suburban <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> campus have been affected by a virus that was discovered last week. A computer virus is akin to a living virus, and can spread from terminal to terminal and even computer system to computer system by `` infected'' discs. It can disrupt such functions as word processing and printing. Some viruses can even destroy valuable files, but <ORGANIZATION> Cal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> officials said the bug found there does not erase data. It does stall computers, though, and removal requires hours of reprogramming, officials said. Students' computer discs are being tested for the virus before they are able to rent a Macintosh at the university bookstore. Earlier this month, another virus duplicated itself in university and government research computers nationwide, slowing the computers' processing speeds and filled up their memories A graduate student is under investigation in that case.

 The army sealed off the occupied lands today to block celebrations of Palestinian independence, but <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths defiantly took to the streets, shooting off firecrackers and singing a nationalist anthem. Underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising called a general strike in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> today to mark what the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile, meeting in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, proclaimed as independence day In <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, under curfew for the first time since 1967, dozens of teen-agers ignored threats of fines and jail terms to run through streets lighting fireworks and singing the nationalist song, `` My Homeland, My Homeland.'' Army jeeps blocked town entrances and soldiers ordered residents to stay indoors. `` Everybody who goes out will endanger his life,'' one soldier announced over a loudspeaker. At Dheishe refugee camp, several cars belonging to Jewish settlers were stoned, their windows smashed. Smoke from burning tires rose from the camp, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers could be heard firing rubber bullets for riot control. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> town of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, an 18-year-old Palestinian was shot by soldiers but the circumstances were not clear, hospital officials said. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a 30-year-old Palestinian prisoner from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> was found strangled to death in his cell in the <LOCATION> Ashkelon </LOCATION> Jail, and police suspect he was slain by an Arab cellmate for allegedly collaborating with the Israeli authorities. The army extended a curfew over the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s 650,000 residents for a fourth day and sealed the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The orders blocked residents of the territories from entering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and reporters from going to either occupied area without an army escort. Police forces were deployed within <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, where leaders of the 720,000 Israeli Arabs ordered a general strike to protest recent house demolitions. In Israeli-annexed Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, an additional 1,000 police officers were deployed to prevent pro-PLO demonstrations, and authorities banned gatherings of more than 10 people. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s first official response to the declaration of independence, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement called it `` double talk.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> predicted `` political war'' with the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> over the declaration. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was quoted by the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> as saying he would propose a new peace plan to <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who opposes a U.N.-sponsored international conference endorsed by the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION>, wants peace negotiations with Palestinians and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states to be under the auspices of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Hever </PERSON>, a settlers' leader from <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> declaration has `` totally no meaning. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rules over the territory and decides what happens.'' <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Teir </PERSON>, a Moslem religious leader, criticized the declaration's implicit recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and repeated the fundamentalist stand that all of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> should be an Islamic state. `` We have been offering sacrifices for many years and now they recognize the state of the Jews. Where is the land of this state?'' he said by telephone from <LOCATION> Umm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Touba </LOCATION> village, near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. The fireworks, graffiti splashed on walls and raising of outlawed <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> flags came despite an army announcement that Palestinians could face prison sentences of five years and fines of $ 10,000 for such actions. In <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, a map picturing <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> before the Jewish state's creation was painted on one wall, with this slogan: `` Congratulations, <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. The map contradicted the independence declaration, which was based on a 1947 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan calling for creation of Jewish and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states side-by-side in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> declaration was expected to fuel the revolt against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The 11-month uprising has cost the lives of at least 312 Palestinians and 11 Israelis. But the declaration will have little immediate impact on life in the occupied lands. Israeli leaders oppose a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, and authorities said they would quash unilateral Palestinian steps toward self-rule. Palestinian leaders expressed hope the declaration would get the stalled peace process moving by implicitly recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` This is the beginning of a new era for the Palestinians,'' said lawyer <PERSON> Fayez </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahme </PERSON>, a prominent <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporter in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` It shows the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> are ready to co-exist with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, that they want a state side-by-side with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 The supreme court today postponed its decision on the extradition of a Palestinian wanted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the 1982 bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jetliner. <PERSON> Panayiotis </PERSON> <PERSON> Theodoropoulos </PERSON>, president of the five-member panel, said the decision to extradite <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> would be issued after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supplies key documents needed to make a ruling. The 39-year-old Palestinian is charged with planting a bomb aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jumbo </ORGANIZATION> jet flying from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. A Japanese teen-ager was killed and 15 other people were injured in the blast. <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> may also be linked to the bloody July 11 attack aboard the City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION> cruise ship off <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> that killed nine people and injured 98. Police theorize the attack may have been a failed attempt to take the ship hostage and force <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>'s release. On Oct. 10, a lower court approved the extradition of <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, but the decision must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Areos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pagos </ORGANIZATION>, the supreme court. Before today's decision was announced, hundreds of police officers and sharpshooters with automatic weapons guarded the court building near the city center. <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>'s defense lawyers contested the postponement, arguing that lower courts had requested the same documents in the past and failed to get them. `` The documents have been requested ... twice in the past. What makes you think they'll send them now?'' defense lawyer <PERSON> Spyros </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitrakis </PERSON> asked the court. The high court asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to supply an official copy of a Japanese visa application allegedly filled in by <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, in July 1982. It also asked for official transcripts of testimony given by an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent that was used to draw up the extradition request. `` These are the documents we need. It they ca n't send them, they have to explain why,'' <PERSON> Theodoropoulos </PERSON> said. According to the extradition request, <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> received a visa in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to visit <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` It is obvious that the judges are not convinced by the American evidence. If they had the documents they would have sent them already,'' <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> told the court. <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> airport on May 29 on a tip from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said they view <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>'s extradition as a test of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s determination to combat international terrorism. American officials have said <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> was also involved in the 1986 bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner over southern <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> that killed four Americans. The blast is not mentioned in the extradition request.

 A <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> synagogue that lost holy Torah scrolls in an arson fire received two replacement scrolls from an unlikely source: a police department warehouse. Police said the Torahs had gone unclaimed and unused for years after being recovered from thieves. `` Today is a very special day,'' Rabbi <PERSON> Hillel </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> said in accepting the Torahs on Monday. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, whose mother was an orphan adopted by a Jewish family in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, said the ceremony held a special significance for him. `` Today I repay a little bit of a major debt that I always felt I owed the Jewish community,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rabbinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Torah </ORGANIZATION> was heavily damaged and five Torah scrolls were destroyed in a fire set on the Sabbath between the holiest days on the Jewish calendar _ <LOCATION> Rosh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashana </LOCATION>, the New Year, and Yom Kippur, the day of repentance. Two boys, ages 12 and 15, from the neighborhood where the synagogue is located, were charged with arson for the Sept. 7 blaze. Police say the two boys broke into the Orthodox synagogue in the racially mixed neighborhood, spray-painted swastikas on the walls, set a fire and unrolled and burned the Torahs. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who made the presentation with Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, said the two Torahs _ <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>'s most holy objects _ originally belonged to a police officer who died years ago. The unidentified officer received the Torahs when a synagogue he attended in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> was disbanded; when he died, they were passed on to his family. In 1983, burglars took the Torahs from the family home but they were recovered by the police, said Deputy Inspector <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who is in charge of the property room. The family members, who asked to remain anonymous, made no effort to reclaim the Torahs. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said that when he contacted them recently, they agreed to donate the scrolls to <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s congregation of about 300.

<TEXT>
 Researchers have discovered small quantities of a radioactive substance in material dredged from <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> about 100 miles downstream from the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>. Cesium 137, a radioactive isotope, was found in material taken from the harbor and dumped on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> side of the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which forms the border with <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Tests found tiny amounts of the material, insufficient to create a health hazard, The <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Courier reported today. The tests were done for the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>. The wildlife agency is sampling dredged material for pollutants because of water quality problems believed to be caused by industrial discharges into the river, agency officials said. Cesium 137 is produced as a byproduct of nuclear fission, and is generally associated with radioactive waste. It emits beta and gamma radiation, both of which can produce a variety of ill effects, depending on the dosage. <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordell </PERSON>, acting director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s environmental division at the nuclear plant, said he had not been informed of the study results, but acknowledged Monday that the material probably originated at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> nuclear plant The complex near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION> produces the radioactive materials plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons. The government-owned plant has been under scrutiny in recent months since it was revealed that a series of accidents at the site over the past 30 years went unreported to the public. <PERSON> Gordell </PERSON> said sediment tests in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> for a 1984 study showed traces of Cesium 137, and that recent monitoring upstream found similar traces both in the water and river sediment. Much of the material leaked from <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION> apparatus in the 1950s, but some is the result of continued discharge into the river, <PERSON> Gordell </PERSON> said. The level of contamination is far below <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s maximum allowable level for drinking water, he said. <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> and Beaufort-Jasper counties pump water from the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for drinking water. Traces of tritium also are found in the river, but also are below the maximum allowable levels, <PERSON> Gordell </PERSON> said. Cesium 137, with a half-life of 30 years, persists in the environment longer than tritium, with a half-life of 12 years. A half-life is the time it takes half the atoms of a radioactive material to disintegrate. The <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> is periodically dredged by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> to maintain its depth for the port of <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>.

 The army opened fire on thousands of people protesting the massacre of Sinhalese bus passengers by suspected Tamil rebels, killing five and injuring 17, police said today. Soldiers began shooting at 3,000 Sinhalese who were demonstrating today in <LOCATION> Matala </LOCATION>, 65 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, after tear gas failed to disperse the crowd, a senior police official said. Two people were killed and 11 wounded, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. On Monday, soldiers and police killed three other people and injured six when they broke up demonstrations in the central towns of <LOCATION> Anuradhapura </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Polonnaruawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Horawapatana </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kekirawa </PERSON>, police said. They said the demonstrations were to protest the government's failure to prevent a massacre of 27 Sinhalese bus passengers by Tamil rebels The rebels ambushed a bus on Monday near the village of <LOCATION> Pinkatiya </LOCATION>, about 140 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, and killed 27 Sinhalese passengers, according to police and military sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Police blamed the largest Tamil rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, denied they were responsible. In a statement issued by their <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office and telexed to news agencies and newspapers, the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> said: `` This is malicious propaganda carried out by the Sri Lankan government to tarnish the image of our organization.'' The police and military sources said the killings were part of a continued Tamil effort to drive away the Sinhalese from the northeast, where the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> have been waging a five-year war for an independent homeland. Tamils, who form 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, claim they are discriminated against by the majority <PERSON> Sinhalese </PERSON>, who form 75 percent of the population and control the military and the government. The government's peace overtures to the Tamils have sparked a backlash among radical Sinhalese, who claim too many concessions have been offered to the minority community. The government has set up local administrative councils to grant limited autonomy to the Tamils, but the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> rejected the plan in 1987 because they said it did not meet their expectations. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> have vowed to disrupt a provincial council election scheduled for Saturday in the northeast. Last week, Sinhalese radicals called a four-day strike to demand the resignation of President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>. The government ordered soldiers to open fire at anti-government demonstrators and decreed the death sentence for people convicted of starting strikes.

 A warning by Soviet human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> that the West has more to fear from the failure of Kremlin reforms than from their successes goes to the heart of a dilemma facing <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as he prepares to lead American policy. `` The threat of perestroika does n't consist of its success but of its bloody failure. This would be a total calamity,'' said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, conjuring up an image of a newly militant Kremlin again embracing the totalitarianism and expansionism of the Stalin era. With <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s words still ringing, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must ask himself how to deal with Gditions to cooperative ventures. If we do n't, we may one day find ourselves the odd man out, economically and militarily,'' wrote <PERSON> Hough </PERSON>, an outspoken <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> enthusiast. Other analysts believe <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is already in domestic political trouble, that there is little the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can do to help or harm him, and that he is interested in good relations with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as well as with the rest of the West. `` The biggest problem that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> faces now is being blamed by our allies if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> fails,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Oudenaren </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> RAND </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> expert on Soviet relations with the West. While it is true that <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> is out and <PERSON> Dobrynin </PERSON> is down, they are no less hostile to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> than the sometimes acid-tongued <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Falin </PERSON>. Moreover, `` the actual impact that we can have on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is limited,'' said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Oudenaren </PERSON>. `` The biggest challenge is to avoid being blamed for a failure of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.'' Such blame can be avoided by being responsive to his initiatives and having a very active diplomacy toward him.'' `` The chances are that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will fail in some way, or enjoy at most a partial success. The wildest expectations that people in the West have for him are not likely to come to pass,'' said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Oudenaren </PERSON>, echoing a view that is widely held by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and academic experts on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had a hyperactive policy toward <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Oudenaren </PERSON>. And that policy bore fruit in the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, signed last December, and in talks toward a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. Those negotiations helped convince the presidential electorate that a vote for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a vote for peace. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may have to keep the same pace if he wishes to make the same argument in 1992.

<HEAD>Judge Declares Mistrial in Aeromexico Liability Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A new trial must be held in the <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION> jetliner disaster because the first jury was tainted by speculation that the pilot of a small plane may have died before slamming into the jetliner, a judge ruled. A pool of prospective jurors was ordered to begin the selection process again today in the trial to determine the blame for the August 1986 accident that killed 82 people. `` I see some prejudice, some very genuine prejudice, to certain parties,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>, who declared a mistrial Monday in the civil suit. The new panel can not hear any allegations that pilot <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> was dead or incapacitated before the accident, ruled <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>. `` It's nothing more than a guess,'' he said at one point. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>'s private plane entered restricted airspace and hit an <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION> airliner over <LOCATION> Cerritos </LOCATION> on Aug. 31, 1986. The pilot was killed along with his wife and daughter, as well as 64 people on the jet and 15 on the ground. In opening statements last week, <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> lawyers said the pilot may have died of heart failure two minutes before his plane collided with the jet. That suggestion tainted the jury, alleged <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegel </PERSON>, who sought a mistrial. <PERSON> Riegel </PERSON> is defending the government in more than 70 lawsuits. Although <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> denied the mistrial motion last Thursday, he did rule the <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> family lawyers could n't raise the death or incapacitation issue because it was purely speculative and the evidence could n't support the scenario. <PERSON> Riegel </PERSON> raised the mistrial motion again Monday. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> granted the motion after several hours of argument. The judge noted that the trial had just begun and no evidence had been presented. `` It seems to me much cleaner'' this way, <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> said, adding he did n't want to take objecting parties `` kicking and screaming'' into the rest of the trial, which is expected to last at least through January. The trial will decide how to apportion liability in the crash so attorneys representing more than 75 plaintiffs can proceed with lawsuits.

 The editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monitor </ORGANIZATION> has resigned, saying her decision was in part a protest of a plan to trim the size of the church-owned paper and `` drastically cut'' its staff. <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON> and two of her top assistants, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Anable </PERSON>, managing editor, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Winder </PERSON>, assistant managing editor of the paper, announced their resignations Monday. Fanning said her resignation also came after a decision to allow business manager, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoagland </PERSON>, control over content, which she said `` threatens the editorial independence.'' `` The increasing diversion of church funds from the Monitor to other media, the decision to downsize the paper and drastically cut its staff means the serious weakening of its editorial substance,'' she said after stepping down from her post. But <PERSON> Hoagland </PERSON> said the changes were positive. `` We expect that this new alignment, plus revenues from our new products, will help support our daily newspaper,'' he said of the 80-year-old paper that has a Monday through Friday circulation of 170,000. `` We continue with an unwavering commitment to offer both print and broadcast services.'' Fanning, 61, said in a statement that the church had decided to cut the daily size of the newspaper to 16 pages from its current average of 28 pages and to eliminate advertising. `` I leave this superb editorial staff with great sadness and profound respect,'' she said. The paper has lost money for years but is widely respected by its readers and by the newspaper industry. <PERSON> Hoagland </PERSON> said redesign and other changes to be implemented in February of next year would be revealed in the next few weeks. Directors of the church named <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nenneman </PERSON>, general manager of print publishing for the church, as editor in chief in charge of editorial content for the newspaper and all of its print and broadcast enterprises. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cattani </PERSON>, editor of the editorial page, was named editor. Fanning became the first woman editor of the Monitor in 1983 after leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where she served as publisher and editor for 12 years. After starting out at the paper as a $ 2-per-hour librarian, she and her late husband, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON>, bought the News in 1967. She served as president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> from April 1987 to April 1988. Supporting the newspaper reportedly has cost the church $ 20 million a year, while the church seeks to establish a monthly newsmagazine, radio and television programs.

 Space shuttle managers will set a launch date Wednesday for a secret military mission to be flown by five astronauts aboard the space shuttle Atlantis. The current target is Nov. 30, but <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION>' processing director, said Monday, `` I think we're looking real hard now at Dec. 1'' because of a few outstanding technical problems He said both dates would be submitted as options to shuttle managers, who began a two-day flight readiness review today. <PERSON> Nagel </PERSON> spoke with reporters following the completion of a countdown simulation for the flight. The five astronauts who will fly the mission climbed aboard Atlantis for the final two hours to run through launch day procedures. The exercise was termed `` very successful'' by <PERSON> Nagel </PERSON>, who reported the only significant problem involved communications with <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. He said that would take one or two days to correct. He also reported some trouble getting accustomed to a new communications system that will be used because the shuttle will be carrying a classified military payload. The mission will be the second for the shuttle program since the Challenger explosion killed its seven crew members in January 1986. Following a 32-month standdown for major modifications, the program resumed on Sept. 29 with the successful launch of Discovery and a five-man crew. In contrast to the fanfare surrounding the Discovery mission, most details about the upcoming flight are not being made public. Atlantis will be making the third <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> shuttle flight dedicated solely to military experiments. Sources report the astronauts will deploy an intelligence-gathering satellite intended to fly over 80 percent of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and also conduct tests aimed at trying to define man's role as a military observer in space. The astronauts assigned to the mission are commander <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, pilot <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials have ordered a bookstore chain catering to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers to stop selling <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s anti-Semitic book `` Mein Kampf,'' an official said today. <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s book has been banned at the 158 Stars and Stripes bookstores in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Deane </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON>, circulation manager for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government organization in <LOCATION> Darmstadt </LOCATION>. `` Mein Kampf'' and other Nazi literature have been banned in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for decades, <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> said, but Stars and Stripes stores had been selling about 70 copies a month of the book. `` It is against German law even to display the book,'' <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> said. `` We're guests in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and I think we should show certain respect to our hosts.'' <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> said the subject of Nazism has become increasingly sensitive in recent days following last week's 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht and former German parliament speaker <PERSON> Philipp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>'s controversial speech marking the occasion. Kristallnacht, meaning Crystal Night, was a night of terror when Nazi sympathizers burned and looted Jewish businesses and synagogues in what is considered the beginning of the Holocaust. Under the Holocaust, 6 million Jews were systematically killed. <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> was forced to resign as president of the Bundestag, or parliament, after an awkward and inflammatory explanation of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s appeal to the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> people. <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> said many Germans considered <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s march through <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` triumphal'' and he bluntly referred to the widespread anti-Semitism among Germans that allowed <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s repression of Jews. Vandalism at Jewish cemeteries by presumed neo-Nazi groups also has been reported over the past few days in <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Buchau </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Sales of `` Mein Kampf,'' `` My Struggle'' in English, at Stars and Stripes stores came to the attention of American military officials in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> last week when a television program, `` Abendschau,'' showed one of its reporters purchasing the book at the store in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Truman Plaza. The book is filled with anti-Semitic outpourings and describes a struggle for world domination. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Jewish community leader, was interviewed during the TV program and expressed dismay that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stores were selling <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s book. <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> said patrons are supposed to show their military identification cards when shopping at the stores. He said the German TV crew had received special permission from Stars and Stripes to enter the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> store. `` There has been an awful lot of publicity on the Kristallnacht anniversary and <PERSON> Philipp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>'s speech, and I think this all came about because of that,'' <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> said. About half of <ORGANIZATION> Stars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stripes </ORGANIZATION>' 199 bookstores in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> had been selling <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s publication since about 1983, <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> said. The order to remove `` Mein Kampf'' from the stores came on Friday from Gen. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Haddock </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commander in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. On Monday, about 600 copies of the book were removed from the German-based stores.

 A woman who agreed to let another mother's child have a liver transplant ahead of her own daughter because the boy needed it more says she is confident her daughter will get a transplant eventually `` Believe you me, I'm not any special person,'' said <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, whose 6-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Candi </PERSON>, was listed in fair condition today at Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. Five-year-old <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Point </PERSON>, who received the liver originally intended for <PERSON> Candi </PERSON>, also was listed in fair condition today at the hospital. `` I'm sure anyone would have to do it. I do have faith and I do believe that in turn, <PERSON> Candi </PERSON> will get hers in time,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' daughter was lying outside the operating room waiting for her transplant on Nov. 1, when doctors discovered that <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s liver was gangrenous. Doctors predicted that the boy would live only another day or two without a transplant. Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Point </PERSON>, were in a waiting room at the hospital renewing a friendship established because both of their children had already undergone one transplant shortly after birth, Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. Doctors had placed the girl under aesthesia to give her a new liver when the children's surgeon appeared, Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. Mrs. Point was awaiting test results on <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>. `` Dr. -LRB- Thomas -RRB- <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> came up. He told us that <PERSON> Candi </PERSON> needs the liver ... but <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> is going to die in 24 to 48 hours because he has gangrene of the liver,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> recalled. `` He said, ` What do we do?' and that's when we offered to give <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> the liver,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, adding that the doctors then sent the girl back to her room. `` It was wonderful. <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> did n't hesitate for an instant,'' <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s mother said. `` Circumstances brought us all together at the same time,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Point </PERSON> said. `` All those circumstances fitting together ... a movie script could n't be more bizarre than this.'' `` At the time my body was numb,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. `` There was just no other way to do it.'' <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> was born with intrahepatic hypoplasia, which means the liver was too small for his body and functioned at only 2 percent. <PERSON> Candi </PERSON> was also born with a birth defect. Both children had received their first liver transplants in their first year of life.

 Troops in armored personnel carriers today patrolled cities on the eve of national elections, and President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> made a national appeal for peace during the balloting. In <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION>, a bomb hidden under wooden carts exploded in a market, killing one person. Nobody immediately claimed responsibility for the explosion and authorities refused to speculate whether it was related to Wednesday's polls. <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> went on national television to urge <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s voters to go to the polls Wednesday and to accept the results peacefully. The race is expected to be close between left-leaning populist leader <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and a nine-party conservative alliance. <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said heavy military and police security would be used to prevent anyone from creating `` an atmosphere of fear or danger.'' The government has said it is deploying hundreds of thousands of troops. `` A healthy tradition of respect for the public verdict through the polls will, God willing, be established this time,'' <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said. `` Gratitude and humbleness for the winners and patience and tolerance for the defeated ones should be the hallmark of behavior after the polls.'' An undetermined number of people were injured by the <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION> bomb, which was planted under some wooden carts in a market, police said. A similar device failed to explode an hour earlier in the same city, adjacent to the capital, <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. The bomb, concealed in an empty cannister at a bicycle stand, only gave off sparks, police said. Pakistani officials blame a wave of terrorist bombings over the past two years on agents of neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s communist government. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> backs Moslem insurgents fighting to oust the Marxists. Election officers have prepared 33,500 polling stations for Wednesday's vote. Leaders of some 30 political parties contesting the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> polls conferred with their aides after the campaign officially ended midnight Monday. The election promises to be <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s first polls open to political parties in more than a decade. A 25-member international delegation sponsored by the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> will monitor polling unofficially. Troops in armored personnel carriers and sandbagged bunkers watched over the southern cities of <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hyderabad </LOCATION>, scene of a bloodbath in September that killed almost 300 people. Both Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the center-right <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> predicted a sweep of the vote. No reliable public opinion polls were published. At stake Wednesday are seats in the 217-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. On Saturday, voters elect 483 legislators to the four provincial assemblies. Official statistics indicate there are about 48 million eligible voters in this Moslem nation of 107 million people. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ordered voters to present state identity cards at polling stations to prevent fraud. The last open elections in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> were held in 1977 under Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father, Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. However, Gen. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> seized power in a military coup shortly afterward and nullified the results, alleging they were rigged. Two years later, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> hanged, allegedly for complicity in a murder plot. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ruled under martial law for eight years before holding national elections in 1985 on a non-party basis. Opposition parties boycotted the polls. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> and 28 others were killed in an Aug. 17 crash of <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s C-130 transport plane. Officials suspect sabotage as the cause, but investigations are continuing.

 A former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostage testified today at the trial of confessed hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> that she still suffers nightmares more than three years after the ordeal. `` I have had nightmares and I'm scared of flying on planes,'' said <PERSON> Marypat </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, a 21-year-old student. Under court guidelines to protect witnesses, she did not state her hometown in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and air piracy in the June 1985 hijacking of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight 847 from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed during the hijacking and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> interrupted the trial today, saying `` I am very exhausted. I feel very dizzy.'' The session was adjourned for nearly an hour while a doctor examined him and told the court he was suffering dizzy spells, headaches and could not concentrate. The doctor, who was not identified, gave <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> an injection of glucose for circulation irregularities. She also said <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> had been eating very little, but was not on a hunger strike. She said medicine he was taking to counter low blood pressure may have accentuated his weakened condition. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> interrupted testimony by Ms. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>'s father, Dr. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, 48. Asked by the judge if he could return to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to conclude his testimony, <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> replied: `` My daughter and I felt that it was unsafe for us to remain in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after the testimony.'' The trial was adjourned until Monday, but <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> still was negotiating a return date. His daughter, <PERSON> Marypat </PERSON>, who was returning from a Greek vacation with her parents and sister when the jetliner was seized, told the court she thought <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> directed the hijacking. `` I personally felt that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was more in charge and that he was the leader,'' she said. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> says the hijacking was directed by his accomplice, fugitive <PERSON> Hassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezzeddin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> admits he was one of the hijackers but denies killing <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> and testimony by several passsengers that he stole money and jewelry. `` He took three rings and three chains from me,'' Ms. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said. `` One would n't come off, so he kept trying to rip it off.'' Asked to comment by the court, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said: `` This is not correct. I never stretch my hand for something like this. I never did anything like this.'' Describing her fears during the hijacking, Ms. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said, `` the longer it continued, the more I was afraid. I did n't know if I was going to live or die.'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport in January 1987 when customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> requested <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s extradition last year, but the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government turned it down, fearing for the lives of the German hostages held in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> at the time. The hostages since have been released.

<HEAD>Hirohito Gets First Transfusion In a Week</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Doctors gave Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> a blood transfusion today to combat anemia, a palace official said. It was the emperor's first transfusion in a week after two months of almost daily transfusions `` The transfusion ... was to combat acute anemia and loss of vital force,'' <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said. `` No signs have been found that His Majesty discharged blood since a week ago.'' <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, 87, the world's longest-reigning monarch, coughed up blood on Sept. 19 and has since been bedridden with internal hemorrhaging from the upper intestinal area where he underwent a bypass operation in September 1987. His received his last transfusion Nov. 8 when his blood pressure suddenly plummeted and his temperature soared. The frail emperor has received 42 pints of blood since the onset of his crisis. He is being fed intravenously, and news reports say his weight has fallen to about 77 pounds, down from 110 pounds when he was healthy. `` Except for anemia, the emperor remained in stable condition. It would n't mean, however, His Majesty's condition is improving. He talks less and falls into sleep more often,'' <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> told reporters in a daily briefing. The monarchs's temperature dropped to 99.1 degrees following the transfusion, compared to 99.7 this morning, palace officials said. His normal temperature is about 95.9. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s blood pressure was 134 over 60, against 138 over 50 in the morning. A healthy person normally has a reading of around 120 over 80, the palace reported. Palace officials have refused comment on reports that <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has pancreatic cancer.

 Arrest warrants were issued today for former <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and two other officials of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> multinational in connection with the 1984 <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> gas disaster. On Dec. 3, 1984, more than 3,100 people were killed and at least 20,000 injured when toxic gas leaked out of a tank at a pesticide plant operated by <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>'s Indian subsidiary. Chief judicial magistrate R.C. <PERSON> Mishra </PERSON> issued the arrest warrants today after <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and the two Carbide officials failed to honor summonses to appear in the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> magistrate's court to answer murder charges. The summonses for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and the two others were issued last December when the murder charges were filed in conjunction with the Indian government's still unresolved $ 3 billion damage suit against <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mishra </PERSON> issued the arrest warrants in response to a request by government prosecutor <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON>. `` They are deliberately trying to disobey the court of law,'' <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON> said. The arrest warrants were issued for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON>, attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong-based </LOCATION> subsidiary. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Slack </PERSON>, assistant director of corporate communications at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, headquarters, said the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> courts have no jurisdiction over <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> or <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is not an Indian corporation, it has no presence in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and under Indian law can have no presence in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>,'' Slack said. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> had not been named individually in the summonses issued last December, but <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON> sought orders for their arrests, saying they had received the earlier summonses on behalf of their companies. <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON> said the Indian government may initiate extradition proceedings if the three men ignore the arrest warrants. In issuing the warrants, <PERSON> Mishra </PERSON> said the trio could be released on $ 1,000 bond each after appearing in magistrate's court. As a magistrate, <PERSON> Mishra </PERSON> is not conducting any actual trial on charges filed in the case. But his job empowers him to preside over some procedural matters, such as failure to answer summonses and whether to commit a case to trial in a higher court. The only <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> representative present today was <PERSON> Rajendra </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the subsidiary that operated the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> pesticide plant. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> did not speak about the arrest warrants, but he argued the murder case should be sent for trial without any other accused persons appearing in court. The Indian subsidiary is a defendant in the $ 3 billion damage suit, and eight of its officers were named when the murder charges filed last December. <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON>, however, argued that the murder case should not be sent for trial unless <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> appear in court. <PERSON> Mishra </PERSON> set Jan. 6 as the date for hearing detailed arguments on whether the murder case should be committed for trial. The damage suit against <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> was filed in 1986 and is still being heard in <ORGANIZATION> Bhopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. It has bogged down in a series of legal maneuverings, a common occurrence in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, where court cases can drag on for years and even decades. The Indian government has accused Union Carbide of negligence for the gas leak. Union Carbide says the leak of lethal methyl isocyanate gas was the result of sabotage by a disgruntled employee.

 <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>'s daily newspaper has agreed to pay the expected $ 15,000 cost of a special county referendum because its omission of a legal advertisement made the special vote necessary. The referendum on Nov. 29 will be on establishment of an enhanced 911 emergency telephone system. `` We have acknowledged forthrightly that the omission of the legal advertisement created a problem, an expensive one,'' said <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` We made a mistake and we will pay the cost of the special election.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON>'s statement Monday came after the <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> voted to ask <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> to pay for the election. The ad announcing a referendum was omitted from the Oct. 11 issue of the newspaper, making it illegal for the county to place the question on the Nov. 8 ballot. The newspaper agreed that county employees were not at fault in the omission of the ad. In the referendum, voters will be asked if they want to pay $ 160,000 for the enhanced 911 system, which proponents say would speed up the response to emergency calls and allow faster tracing of victims who need help.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> today opened a sweeping general inquiry into the use of illegal drugs in athletics after sprinter <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Johson </PERSON> was stripped of his Olympic gold medal for using steroids. <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> Associate Chief Justice <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubin </PERSON>, appointed by the federal government, said the investigation would examine drug abuse in all Canadian athletics except professional sports. `` This is not an inquiry merely into the conduct of one or more individuals,'' said <PERSON> Dubin </PERSON>, referring to the issue of whether <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> used anabolic steroids, as drug tests showed after his Olympic victory. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> maintains that he never knowingly used drugs to enhance his performances, capped by the world record 9.79 second, 100-meter race at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, on Sept. 24. <PERSON> Dubin </PERSON> said the inquiry also would examine if too much pressure was being placed on Canadian athletes to encourage them to cheat. `` Are Canadian athletes being exploited by others ... who would risk reputation or health?'' he asked. Canadian euphoria at <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s victory over <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> quickly turned to sadness and disgrace as he was stripped of the medal. `` I would never embarrass my family, my friends, my country and the kids who love me,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said after his return from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Some remained loyal, and T-shirts appeared with the slogan, `` Ben Did n't Do It.'' They have slipped out of store display windows as the weeks since the Olympics passed. Ironically, the hearings start at a time when Canadians are enmeshed in an unusually passionate debate on their national identity as part of the campaign for next Monday's national election. At stake is the free trade agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> scheduled to take effect Jan. 1. Opponents of the pact argue that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> faces a tremendous threat to its national identity and could be overwhelmed by the more populous and wealthier <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They point to a sense of fairness and community as being central to the concept of Canadian nationality. In the other incident this year of total national absorption in sports, hockey hero <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gretzky </PERSON> abandoned <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, to pursue a more lucrative, flashier career in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butt </PERSON>, a sports psychologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, said Canadians `` have that tendency'' of placing the national ego on the line over an athletic event. `` Hopefully, we can all educate ourselves to become more realistic and mature about sports,'' she said in a phone interview, adding that the hearings on drug abuse are `` a wonderful opportunity for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to lead instead of being burdened with it.'' <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Minden </PERSON>, a psychologist from <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who traveled to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> with the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> Olympic team, said he was surprised by the tremendous response to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s victory and the subsequent rush to judge him in public opinion. `` They really were a little overwhelmed and ecstatic when he won, then went down in the basement of emotion when he lost -LRB- the medal -RRB-,'' <LOCATION> Minden </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Konzak </PERSON>, an expert in sports psychology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION>, said the hearings should examine the competitive pressures put on <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and the excessive push for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to win a gold medal in a high-profile event. `` Why were we so lax in testing our own athletes? It was because we wanted a winner,'' he said. <PERSON> Dubin </PERSON> led a federal inquiry into airline safety several years ago. He can call witnesses, require testimony, hire expert advisers and take the hearings anywhere in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> or out of the country. Among the most eagerly awaited witnesses are <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>; his coach, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>; and Dr. <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaphan </PERSON>, the physician who treated the athlete. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> has been banned from competition for two years by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amateur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, which governs world track and field.

 A man who successfully sued the government for medical malpractice, blaming it for what he said was near total blindness, has been convicted of fraud and perjury. Friends and neighbors testified they had seen <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedgecorth </PERSON> mowing his lawn, reading, playing cards and even driving a car. <PERSON> Hedgecorth </PERSON>, 54, of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, was awarded $ 825,000 in 1984 when he sued the government, claiming he lost nearly all of his vision when he suffered a stroke in a stress test administered at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cochran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adminstration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> here. The damage award was later overturned after the judge in the case learned of <PERSON> Hedgecorth </PERSON>'s activities. <PERSON> Hedgecorth </PERSON> was indicted on four counts of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and three counts of perjury stemming from his testimony in the civil suit. One charge of mail fraud was later dismissed. In closing arguments Monday, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steitz </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Hedgecorth </PERSON> had passed a vision test when renewing his driver's license. <PERSON> Steitz </PERSON> recounted testimony of a radiologist who testified that <PERSON> Hedgecorth </PERSON>'s brain showed no evidence of the kind of stroke it would take to blind him. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hedgecorth </PERSON>'s attorney, said his client had simply adapted to his impairment. He cited the testimony of several blind and visually impaired witnesses, all of whom said they knew of legally blind people who occasionally drove cars. <PERSON> Hedgecorth </PERSON> faces up to 30 years in prison and $ 1.5 million in fines. Sentencing was set for Dec. 23.

<HEAD>Rate of Job-Related Injuries and Illnesses Increased By 18 Percent
Last Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The rate of job-related injuries and illnesses increased by 5 percent last year, with 351,000 more injuries and 53,000 more illnesses reported, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> said 83 of every 1,000 workers experienced some kind of job-related illness or injury last year compared with 79 of every 1,000 workers in 1985 and 1986. Meanwhile, job-related fatalities in surveyed private businesses with 11 or more employees dropped from 3,610 in 1986 to 3,400 last year. <ORGANIZATION> BLS </ORGANIZATION> officials called the decline `` statistically insignificant.'' The increase in injury and illness rates was the first since 1984. A total of 5,843,100 workers were injured on the job last year compared with 5,492,000 in 1986, the bureau said. Nearly half of the injuries were so severe that employees lost a full day or more of work and the number of work days lost totaled 48.8 million, compared with 45.4 million work days lost to injuries in 1986. Some 190,000 workers suffered new illnesses for the first time, most of them involving noise-related hearing losses, skin diseases and repetitive motion ailments such as carpal tunnel syndrome prevalent in the meatpacking industry. That is a 28 percent increase over the 136,900 new cases of job-related illnesses reported in 1986. The bureau said chronic and long-term latent cases that are often difficult to recognize or relate to the workplace are included in the illness statistics `` but are clearly understated.'' Labor Statistics Commissioner <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON> said the increase in the job injury and illness rates may be due to better recordkeeping due to new government guidelines and intensive efforts to improve the statistics. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> last year questioned validity of the government's job health and safety data because of `` severe underreporting'' by employers to avoid workmen's compensation claims or government inspections. An academy panel said the actual number of job-related fatalities could be as much as triple those reported by the bureau. The <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has placed a new emphasis on accurate records, levying hundreds of fines, some of them in the millions of dollars, against employers for not reporting job-related injuries or illnesses. Of the 3,400 reported on-the-job fatalities last year, two-thirds occurred in the construction, manufacturing, transportation or public utility industries. As in previous years, the single biggest cause was traffic accidents, accounting for about one-third of the deaths, the government said.

 Pungent smoke from an underground landfill fire spread for miles today as firefighters spent a fifth day battling a blaze that is keeping 25 families from their homes. `` This morning, when people got up in <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, they awoke to clouds of steamy, smelly smoke,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> emergency services director. A temperature inversion kept cloud cover low overnight, and smoke from the unlicensed landfill about three miles west of <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> could n't dissipate, Lent said. `` The smell that people complained about does n't mean that it's getting worse It actually means that we're making headway,'' Lent said. Overnight, workers continued their `` wet and smother'' strategy against the blaze, which started Thursday night. Water and air sample results should be available later today, which would determine if the evacuated residents can go home, Lent said. While the dump owner has claimed there was nothing toxic in the landfill, low levels of PCBs were found in the smoke. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said the level of the chemicals did not exceed federal safety standards. The city of <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> kept in effect a health alert for residents of its west side, and Lent said all residents bothered by the smoke were being advised to stay indoors. Bulldozers and dump trucks dug trenches Monday on two sides of the smoldering area while acrid smoke poured from about two acres of the 17-acre landfill. One trench, 30 feet wide by 30 feet deep and 400 feet long, was filled with dirt Monday to form a firebreak similar to those used in forest fires, Lent said. The other was to be filled in today, he said. It might take days to extinguish the fire, he said. <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> reported 35 people, most of them firefighters, had been treated for respiratory problems from the smoke. No serious injuries have been reported. Lent said the dump contains plastic piping, gypsum board, wood and other building materials placed there by its owner, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rock </PERSON>, who has been charged with operating a dump without a permit.

 The pilot of a small plane that crashed into a shopping mall filled with Christmas shoppers and killed seven people covered up serious medical problems, a jury was told. About 70 people are seeking $ 35 million in damages in connection with the Dec. 23, 1985, crash at the <LOCATION> Sunvalley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>. Opening arguments began Monday. Beech Aircraft, which built the plane in 1962, and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which inspected and maintained it, are defendants in a civil trial to determine whether they should bear any liability for the crash. <ORGANIZATION> Beech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said the crash was caused solely by pilot error when <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, 67, became disoriented in heavy fog. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and his two passengers were among those killed. In addition, more than 70 people were injured. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> lied to doctors who examined him for annual flight physicals in 1983, 1984 and 1985 by saying in answer to a questionnaire item that he had n't seen any doctors during the previous year. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> also stated in 1985 that he was not using any medication when he was taking blood-pressure medicine that can cause drowsiness, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said. `` There is no way in the world,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> could have passed his 1985 flight physical if he had disclosed his high blood pressure. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> had been taking an amphetamine daily, was receiving injections of testosterone, a steroid, at least twice a month, suffered from a sleeping disorder called early narcolepsy and sometimes fell asleep in his car or at his desk. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON>, an attorney for the plaintiffs, contended that the plane had a defectively designed left engine that performed improperly.

<TEXT>
 The Communist Party's chief of legal affairs chastised Estonian leaders for encouraging nationalism and increasing political tension in their tiny republic, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said today. Politburo member <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the Estonian party had `` committed serious miscalculations in the areas of inter-ethnic relations,'' the official news agency said. <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON>, whose visit likely was meant as a message to Estonians to tread cautiously, made the remarks in a speech Monday to <LOCATION> Estonian </LOCATION> party, government and economic officials. `` It is necessary to seek what unites rather than divides,'' said <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON>, who was head of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> until September, when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appointed him to his present post. The growth of ethnic tensions in the Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, as well as the southern republics of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> have become a severe test of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of greater openness and economic reforms. Party and government officials in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> have joined activists in demanding greater economic and political autonomy from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Last week, they said in a meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that the Soviet leader's intended reform of the political system would take away many of their republic's rights rather than increase local control. On Monday, <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> assured Estonian leaders that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> was pleased more people were getting involved in public issues and gaining a stronger ethnic identity. But he said ethnic feelings were going too far. <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> told the Estonian officials `` the situation in the republic is characterized by a growing political tension,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. He described as especially alarming the division of the population along ethnic lines, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> on Friday, the same day two other Politburo members were sent to the Baltic on similar missions. <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> ideology chief, went to the republic of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Slyunkov </PERSON>, chief of social and economic development, visited the republic of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported the <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Slyunkov </PERSON> visits, but their speeches to officials were not as sharp as <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, where the reform movement has been the most active and organized.

 The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile proclaimed an independent Palestinian state today, and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said the decision now puts `` the ball ... in the American court.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> made the declaration early today, approving a new political program that indirectly recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Council delegates broke into applause and the occasion was immediately followed by quiet handshakes, kisses and an occasional tear. At a news conference later, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> described the council meeting as the `` intefadeh -LRB- uprising -RRB- session,'' referring to 11 months of unrest by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` But it could also be the session of peace with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' he said. In a more threatening tone, he added: `` Let it also be clear I can always come back to our -LRB- council -RRB- and declare that moderation does not pay.'' `` Our political statement contains moderation, flexibility and realism, which the West has been urging us to show, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. `` The ball is now in the American court.'' Earlier today, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops sealed off the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where Arab youths took to the streets to celebrate the declaration and underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising called a general strike. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, under curfew for the first time since 1967, teen-agers ignored threats of fines and jail terms to run through the streets setting off fireworks and singing a nationalist song. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> did not describe the new state's borders, except to say that a 1947 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan that provided for separate Jewish and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> still provides the basis for `` international legitimacy.'' The Palestinian territory referred to in the declaration presumably meant the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Passage of the proclamation could mark a turning point in the four-decade struggle through repeated Arab-Israeli wars and recurrent guerrilla attacks. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> gained independence in 1948, when British rule ended. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> declaration will not necessarily have any immediate effect because the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is unable to challenge <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for actual control, either in the occupied territories or in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> proper. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders consider it rather as a historic step toward creation of an independent state in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rejected any change in its attitude toward the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> even before the new policy was officially approved. `` It's not a problem of definition and formulations of various positions,'' said Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. `` We'll not negotiate with them because they're opposed to peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' The declaration says: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, in the name of God, and in the name of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> people, hereby proclaims the establishment of the state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> on our <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> territory with its capital <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>.'' A less symbolic but equally important move was the new Palestinian political program, which clearly aims to overcome the major objections put forth by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as reasons for not dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The council, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s highest policy-making body, issued a political declaration accepting <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 242 _ which implicity recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. The declaration also rejects terrorism, restricting <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla action to military targets in the occupied territories, which 1.5 million Palestinians share uneasily with 70,000 Jewish settlers. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the initial response was cautious. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> action could represent progress, but added there were `` other problems that remain to be solved.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has demanded the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renounce terrorism before there could be any dealings. Resolution 242 calls for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from territories it seized from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had in the past rejected it because of the recognition of the Jewish state and because it referred to the Palestinian question as a refugee problem. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s political declaration calls for the convening of an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspicies and with participation of the permanent member states of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and all parties to the conflict, including the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. It also calls for a complete <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and Israeli-annexed Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and for putting the occupied lands under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision for a transitional period. The third item on the agenda of the council was approval of a provisional government, to be formed at a later stage. That government would be mandated to negotiate a peace settlement. For the moment, however, the government of the newly declared Palestine is the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is a 450-member bicameral parliament-in-exile with members selected from <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla factions and professional unions. It was formed in 1964 by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>.

 Millions of Brazilians voted today for mayors and city councilors in nationwide elections considered a popularity test of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s beleaguered government. Some campaign workers were arrested for violating a law that prohibits campaigning within 100 yards of polling stations. They tried to hand out sample ballots with their candidate's name written in. However, no serious incidents were reported by early afternoon. People waitied patiently in lines up to four blocks long after polls opened at 8 a.m. -LRB- 5 a.m. EST -RRB-. They were to close at 5 p.m. -LRB- 2 p.m. EST -RRB-. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> voted in his home state of <LOCATION> Maranhao </LOCATION>, in far northern <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, then returned to <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>. Election results, not expected in full before Sunday, could indicate how Brazilians will vote next November in the first presidental elections in 29 years in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s biggest and most populous country. Voting is mandatory, and Brazilians who do n't vote face trouble getting a passport and obtaining a government loan or a civil service job. But polls show voter apathy is high. Campaigns urging voters to protest through voided ballots or to vote for nonsense candidates _ such as a popular chimpanzee in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION> _ have attracted national attention. At stake are mayorships and council seats in 4,307 cities and towns. Campaigning by candidates from 29 parties has been unrestricted in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, which in 1985 returned to civilian government after 21 years of right-wing military rule. Parties ranged from Communist groups to supporters of the former military government. Although the voting is based largely on local matters, political analysts say Brazilians will also be voicing their opinion on <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s conservative-to-centrist Brazilian <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Polls indicate that the party _ which in 1986 swept elections for state governors, state assemblies and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ will be lucky to win the mayoral seats in three of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s largest cities. The governing party has been blamed for the soaring inflation and a 40 percent dip in workers' buying power. It has also faced charges of corruption and nepotism. Last week, soldiers killed three workers at the state-run <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in a clash with strikers. Protest signs at the workers' funerals said, `` Enough of <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>.'' Federal troops have been assigned to 207 cities in 13 states to maintian order during voting. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, a 58-year-old politician and poet, gained office as the running mate of <PERSON> Tancredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Neves </PERSON>, who was chosen in a military-controlled electoral college vote. <PERSON> Neves </PERSON> died shortly before taking office. The leading mayoral candidates according to Brazilian polls were: _ <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, the country's largest and richest city: <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Maluf </PERSON>, 57, wealthy industrialist and the defeated military-backed candidate for president in 1985 An appointed state governor and mayor under the military regime, <PERSON> Maluf </PERSON> belongs to the former regime's official <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. _ <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>, the second-largest city: <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> <PERSON> Alencar </PERSON>, 63, a lawyer, journalist and former appointed mayor of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> He is from the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and an ally of <PERSON> Leonel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brizola </PERSON>, the leading left-wing candidate for president in 1989. _ <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> <PERSON> Horizonte </PERSON>, the No 3 city: <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Pimenta </PERSON> da <PERSON> Veiga </PERSON> <PERSON> Filho </PERSON>, 41, of the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a rebel breakaway group from <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. _ <ORGANIZATION> Porto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alegre </ORGANIZATION>, largest city in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s south: <PERSON> Olivio </PERSON> <PERSON> Dutra </PERSON>, 47, militant bank workers union leader, federal congressman and member of the far-leftist Workers' Party _ <LOCATION> Fortaleza </LOCATION>, largest city in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s poor north: <PERSON> Ciro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON>, 31, a lawyer and constitutional law professor, from the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>

<TEXT>
 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> today accepted a challenge from the head of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s official trade union alliance for a nationally televised debate on trade unions in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, Politburo member and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> OPZZ </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> All-Poland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>, made the challenge in an interview in today's edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Trybuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludu </ORGANIZATION>. Publication of <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>'s offer in the official press appeared to indicate the proposal already had official approval. `` All members of the government will be glad to sit in front of their TV sets and listen to such a discussion,'' government press spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said at his weekly news conference. The debate would be <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s first appearance on state television since 1983, when he challenged then-Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> after <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> gave a televised speech at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> became prime minister in September. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> accepted the invitation to debate in a statement today. No date was announced. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s official trade unions were set up by the government in 1982 after the banning of Solidarity, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first independent union. Solidarity supporters say more than one union should be allowed to exist in each workplace because official unions are too tame and do not adequately represent workers' interests. Also today, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> addressed a rally of 3,000 workers in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> and told them he will support management plans to restructure and save the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION>, Solidarity's birthplace.

The four face a joint manslaughter trial Dec. 12 in the Oct. 14 death of 8-year-old <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorea </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>. She was among more than 50 children living at the association's religious-athletic camp near <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON>. The four adults were supervising the children at the time. Her father, who was not charged, was then in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where the group was founded. <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> had said that his goal was to train inner-city youth from the <LOCATION> Watts </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to compete in future Olympic Games. Neighbors in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> complained when the group moved there that they saw children exercising for long periods of time and in extremely hot weather. After the girl's death, the 53 remaining children, ages 1 -LCB- months to 16 years, were taken into custody by Children's Services Division officials. On Monday, <LOCATION> Clackamas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> granted defense motions for the release of <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, 35, and <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 37. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> ordered them to remain in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> until the trial, to contact their attorneys in person weekly and not to be in charge of children under 18. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> reduced bail to $ 25,000 from $ 250,000 for <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinson </PERSON>, 30, and <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON>, 28. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Thom </PERSON>, a court-appointed attorney representing <PERSON> Brinson </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> that it was unlikely the defendants could post the reduced bail.

 A strong earthquake today hit the southern area devastated by a Nov. 6 quake in which more than 930 people died, but official media reported no additional casualties. The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the quake, which measured 5.7 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, was one of the stronger aftershocks of last week's deadly earthquake in <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> province near the Burmese border The area has been hit by more than 1,300 aftershocks since the Nov. 6 quake, which registered 7.6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. Seismologists have predicted one more strong tremor. The Richter scale is a gauge of the strength of an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake with a measurement of 5 can cause considerable damage in a populated area. Each increase of one digit on the scale indicates a tenfold increase in the strength of the quake. The Nov. 6 quake killed at least 938 people, injured more than 4,000 and left hundreds of thousands homeless, according to official figures. It affected a wide swath of remote mountain terrain inhabited mostly by farmers. Foreign reporters have not been allowed to visit the worst-hit areas.

 Hundreds of prostitutes marched out of the city's biggest red light district Tuesday night, demanding free health care, education for their children and an end to police harassment. The women, including aging brothel keepers who grew up in the profession and supervise younger prostitutes, marched for four miles through the streets of <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>. A small delegation also met state officials. About 800 women started the march, participants said, but by the time they reached their rally site in south <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> four hours later, the number had dwindled to about 400. One marcher, <PERSON> Rukmanibai </PERSON> <PERSON> Bansode </PERSON>, 58, complained that some prostitutes were starving. She said schools refused to admit their children, and money lenders charged interest rates as high as 50 percent. The marchers were escorted by men from the Dalit Panthers, a group formed in the 1970s to fight for the rights of the downtrodden. Other demands included protection from thugs and an end to exploitation by money lenders. After a meeting with <LOCATION> Maharashtra </LOCATION> state Chief Minister <PERSON> Sharad </PERSON> <PERSON> Pawar </PERSON>, the delegation announced to a cheering crowd that all their demands had been granted. The government had no immediate comment. <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, a port city of 8 million people, has an estimated 100,000 prostitutes. About half live in central's <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kamathipura </LOCATION> area. They do business openly, charging as little as $ 1.35, but business has slacked off in recent months after one prostitute died of AIDS. <PERSON> Minoo </PERSON> <PERSON> Irani </PERSON>, an assistant police commissioner, said a woman engaging in prostitution does not violate a 1986 law that defined prostitution as `` sexual exploitation for commercial gain.'' He said it was illegal to solicit customers. `` We normally do not raid red light areas unless citizens complain that minors are being detained,'' he said.

We'll just have to see what comes up.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> commented as he posed for photographers before a meeting with West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> in the Oval Office. `` We hope we can have a brief get-together,'' the president said of the upcoming meeting, which will be his fifth with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that neither a date nor a site has been set, although he acknowledged that it would likely take place in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> while <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is there to address the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Other officials, requesting anonymity, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would probably meet with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Dec. 7. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asked today if the December meeting could end up like the summit in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, to which <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> brought surprise proposals on arms control but from which no agreements flowed, the president responded, `` That depends on whether you are going by the public version of <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> or what actually happened there.'' He did not elaborate and reporters went on to other questions. When a reporter noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he does not need to get acquainted with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> because he already is, the president replied that the vice president `` has been involved in the meetings that we've had in all these eight years we've been here and he has met and is familiar with all the national leaders that we've met. ...'' Asked, then, why <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was going to be at the meeting, he said, `` I think now, in his present situation, it would be proper for him to be present.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would meet, probably together, with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, for what <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said was intended to be `` a cordial meeting between superpower leaders reflecting the friendship they have created and the historic change in the relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would meet with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders as part of `` a continuation of the U.S.-Soviet political dialogue that we believe should continue without artificial pause.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the main purpose of the meeting from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standpoint would be to `` ensure that the momentum and continuity of the arms control talks are extended and it will reaffirm the relationship between the general secretary and the new president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` I would not look to it as a meeting that would be settling things -LRB- differences -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> acknowledged that the Kremlin had proposed that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> meet with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in just the last few days and that the administration had quickly approved the request. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also will visit <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> aid in a dispatch from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> intends to appear in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at the session of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> to set forth the views of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on the most important problems of world development,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Earlier, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> announced that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, would visit <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Dec. 12-14. Buckingham Palace said today that Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> also intended to meet with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. A get-together would also give the two sides another chance to narrow the gap on a treaty to reduce long-range nuclear weapons arsenals and to ease tensions caused by Afghan rebel attacks on Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and a slowdown in the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal from the country The treaty is bogged down with several technical problems that may not be easily solved. But on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the Soviets already have pledged to have all their forces out by Feb. 15. Two weeks ago, citing attacks by the U.S.-armed rebels, the Soviets announced suspension of the withdrawal. Still, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has not ruled out adhering to the deadline set in last spring's <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. A year ago, the Soviet leader made his first trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, he signed an unprecedented treaty to abolish <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear weapons. It was the first arms control treaty to actually reduce nuclear arsenals. But a pact on strategic weapons, which are globe-girdling and far more deadly, has continued to elude <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have held four annual meetings beginning in 1985, improving U.S.-Soviet relations on a number of fronts. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, said after winning the presidency last week that he would like to hold a summit meeting with the Soviet leader. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has set relatively easy conditions for a summit meeting with the Soviet leader sometime after moving into the White House in January. He asked only that it produce progress on arms control, human rights or regional disputes. But first, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, he would have <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, whom he has named as his choice for secretary of state, meet with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and with foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ruled out a mere get-acquainted session. `` I am acquainted with him,'' the president-elect said of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` What I want to see is progress. I've never supported meetings just for the sake of having meetings.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> first met with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, in November 1985. They held their second summit in 1986 in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, then met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December and in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> May 29-June 2. The two superpowers are close to an agreement to reduce their armories of long-range bombers, missiles and submarines by 30 to 50 percent, but are wrestling with problems over how to verify some of the cutbacks.

 Spray-painted slogans reading `` AIDS Mormons'' and `` Mormons Go Home'' sometimes greet students walking to class at the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> study center on the biblical Mount of Olives. The graffiti signals a renewal of anti-Mormon sentiment in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, especially among Orthodox Jews who fear the Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day Saints is conducting missionary work at its $ 15 million facility. Mormon officials deny the charge. But Orthodox leaders vow to use the political muscle their parties gained in this month's national elections to remove the Mormons from the Holy Land. `` We want them to leave and now we have room to do something about it,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Porush </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Agudat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won five seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament. `` The Mormons are very dangerous. They have made it unsafe for Jews.'' <PERSON> Porush </PERSON> contends the Mormons are trying `` to systematically convert young Jews'' in violation of a lease agreement that forbids missionary activities at their <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Center for Near Eastern Studies. He said Orthodox leaders want the Israeli government to buy the Mormon center and convert it into a religious high school for Jews. `` We would be more than happy to buy it from them,'' <PERSON> Porush </PERSON> said. `` We will pay any price.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON>, the center's director, said the seven-story marble and limestone building `` is not for sale.'' He added that he expects the government to honor the Mormons' 49-year lease on the property despite the growing influence of Orthodox parties `` We realize there are certain groups that wish we were n't here,'' <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON> said in an interview `` But we respect the integrity of the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which has made a commitment that we intend to keep.'' Construction of the center began in 1984 after lengthy negotiations between the Israeli government and the Mormon-operated <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, which runs the center. Approval was given only after the Mormons pledged not to proselytize. The <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, with headquarters in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, has some 6,500 congregations worldwide with more than 3 million members. Since its completion in January, the center has been supervised by a five-member committee of three Israeli government officials and two Mormon representatives. <PERSON> Haim </PERSON> <PERSON> Klugman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> director-general who serves as committee chairman, said there is no evidence the Mormons have violated their agreement. `` We are here to deal with every complaint, but we have had none,'' <PERSON> Klugman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON> said the center's nine faculty members and 105 students are well aware of the conditions of the lease and are careful not to do or say anything that could be misinterpreted as missionary work. `` Some people think we're here to convert their Jewish state to a Mormon state,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Daines </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Provo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. A junior at <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Daines </PERSON> is a student at the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> center. `` I came here to study and to learn, not to proselytize,'' <PERSON> Daines </PERSON> insisted. He said he ignored the graffiti. Students take courses for a four-month program that includes <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> history, archeology and Bible studies. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillyard </PERSON>, 20, a native of <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and a junior from <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jews </ORGANIZATION> need not be concerned despite the tradition of missionary work among young Mormons. `` I understand that they were a little nervous about letting us in,'' she said. `` But we gave our word.'' Earlier this year, the American-born right-wing Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> and about 50 of his supporters marched near the center to demand its closure. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> vowed to shut it down if he came to power. <PERSON> Porush </PERSON> contends the Mormons use the study center as a cover for missionary activities from the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Olives </LOCATION>, where Christians believe <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> ascended to heaven. He said the national elections, in which religious parties captured 18 of the 120 seats in parliament, have put Orthodox Jews in a position to scrutinize Mormon activities. `` We are not trying to hurt any religion, we just want our religion to be left alone,'' <PERSON> Porush </PERSON> said. `` We will not let them do their dangerous missionary work here.''

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> opened an international exhibit of its arsenal Tuesday complete with scale models and videos of the weapons in action. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the country's largest arms manufacturers, said it was putting six new missiles on the market during the four-day <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exposition </ORGANIZATION>, or Asiandex 88. They included several medium-range coastal defense missiles intended to replace the Silkworm, which Vice President <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rengui </PERSON> said used outdated technology and was being phased out. The Silkworm became <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most famous missile when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> used one in October 1987 to attack a Kuwaiti oil tanker flying the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> denied selling Silkworms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and said it did not know where <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> bought them. But Western experts said the new missiles and other weapons shown at <LOCATION> Asiandex </LOCATION> already were being promoted to potential buyers, and that the show contained no surprises. The exhibit demonstrated <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s determination to increase its arms sales despite criticism from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western countries that Chinese sales to primarily Third World countries are destabilizing. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> does not release figures on its arms sales, but the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government estimates <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> sold sold about $ 2 billion in weapons abroad in 1987. It is the fourth-largest weapons seller to the Third World after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> began taking part in international arms shows in 1984, and held the first show of its own, <ORGANIZATION> Asiandex </ORGANIZATION> 86, two years ago. Nearly 100 foreign companies also had booths at the exhibition, including the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marconi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Technika </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Cardoen </PERSON>. Arms manufacturers from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and other countries also were represented. One Western manufacturer said his company attended not in hopes of making an immediate sale to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but simply to keep up contacts with the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military. `` We've talked with them and they sent a team to tour our plant at one point but _ nothing,'' he said. A Western source noted <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been uninterested in importing large quantities of weapons. `` What they want is joint ventures, so they can learn the technology and reverse-engineer and make it themselves,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Many of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s current weapons were derived in this way from 1950s Soviet models. In recent years <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has entered into agreements with Western companies to use their advanced technology to upgrade its obsolete arsenal. <ORGANIZATION> Aeritalia </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> supplied avionics technology for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s new A5-M fighter plane, which recently had a successful test flight. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British companies also have cooperated in updating Chinese tanks and planes. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s strategy has been to use arms exports to subsidize improvements in its domestic arsenal that it could not otherwise afford. Its biggest market has been the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, where it has sold to both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> during their 8-year-old border war.

 <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, with at least four more years ahead of her as prime minister, flew to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today to bid goodbye to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and welcome President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to the ranks of Western leaders. The prime minister left <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> under tight security at 4 p.m. -LRB- 11 a.m. EST -RRB-, bound for <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who has marched in ideological step with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> since he took office eight years ago, thanked him in a speech Monday for what she said has been his main contribution to the West: `` Let us above all thank President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for ending the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>'s retreat from world responsibility, for restoring the pride and leadership of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, and for giving the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> back its confidence _ confidence not only in the success of free enterprise but also in the values which guide our societies. Speaking at the annual Lord Mayor's banquet in the City, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s financial area, she added: `` He has left <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> stronger, prouder, greater than ever before and we thank him for it.'' In the speech, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> also announced that Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would visit <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> Dec. 12-14. Around Dec. 7, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is to visit the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> as well as meet with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for a fifth time and possibly see <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> also welcomed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as `` a worthy successor'' to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` We know him as a friend, we admire him as a man of unrivaled experience and we respect him because he stands for all that is best in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' she said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Monday that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was the best statesman he had met. Asked by a group of schoolchildren at the White House if he thought the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would ever have a woman president, he said: `` I am certainly not against -LRB- a female president -RRB- ... `` As a matter of fact, the statesman in the world that I have met, that I respect the most, is the prime minister of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, and she has done a remarkable job for <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> came to office 1 -LCB- years after Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, and together they have reinvigorated the long-standing special relationship between the two countries. But while <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> must step down, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, 63, who is now the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>'s longest serving leader, faces no such constraints. Her present tenure lasts another four years, and she has said she will seek a fourth term in the 1990s. If the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader wins that means she will be working with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> right up to 1992. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> have shared a deep anti-Communist ideology, distaste for welfarism, faith in free markets and belief in negotiating from strength. They have helped each other at critical movements, sometimes at great political risk _ <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> by approving arms supplies and intelligence to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in the 1982 Falklands War against <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> by letting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> use <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombers based in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to bomb <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in 1986. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> played a role in the Reagan-Gorbachev thaw. She was the first major Western leader to visit <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> after he came to power in 1985. And on his way to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to sign the arms-reduction treaty in 1987, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> stopped in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for talks with the prime minister. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> arrives in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> tonight, and will have talks with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Wednesday, followed by a state dinner.

<HEAD>Culture Minister Calls For Review of Dissident Policy, Past</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Slovak culture minister on Tuesday called on leaders to correct mistakes that have pushed people away from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and into the embrace of independent groups and churches. <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Valek </PERSON>'s unusually critical analysis of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s political situation was published by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper Rude Pravo He said the country's leaders must right mistakes made since the 1968 `` Prague Spring'' reforms were crushed. `` We must analyze the past period properly and expose errors and mistakes not only in the economy but also in politics,'' he wrote. `` On the one hand, there were anti-socialist and ... unrealistic tendencies. On the other hand, there were rational political and economic pressures, the need for reform, and those should have been seen and differentiated.'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> installed the conservative Czechoslovak leadership after the Aug. 21-22, 1968, invasion that crushed the reforms of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>. While embracing some economic reforms, it has been reluctant to follow <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s example in initiating wide-ranging political reforms. The Slovak official said the purge of 500,000 people from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was perceived, especially by the young, `` as an all-embracing condemnation of opposition, as a political trauma.'' This `` trauma ... has n't passed yet and is not going to pass all by itself.'' An analysis of the past was imperative, he said, to regain people's confidence. `` It is necessary to analyze continuously the cause of the birth and development of Charter 77'' human rights group, young people's apathy toward the official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and increasing interest in religion, the minister said `` All these are facts to which realistic policy can neither surrender nor close its eyes naively,'' <PERSON> Valek </PERSON> wrote. The leadership's apparent unwillingness to re-evaluate the spirit of 1968 was highlighted by the police quelling of an Aug. 21 demonstration to mark the 20th anniversary of the invasion and official articles condemning <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> and his reforms. Last week, up to 25 activists were taken into preventive custody in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> to stop a symposium to examine <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s role in history. On Tuesday, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> strongly denounced Czechoslovak authorities for thwarting the symposium and served notice it will irrevocably block consensus on any <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> follow-up meeting in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. In a statement to the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> meeting of the 35-nation <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> review conference on human rights, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said, `` The contempt they -LRB- <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> authorities -RRB- displayed for the rights of Czechoslovak citizens amounts to contempt for the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> meeting and the ... process in which <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> pledged to respect those rights.'' He said <PERSON> Czechoslovkia </PERSON>'s poor human rights record disqualified it from hosting a follow-up meeting. `` A prospective host should have a credible record on the subject to be discussed,'' he said. The Dutch <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> called in Czechoslovak Ambassador <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Chlad </PERSON> to condemn the crackdown as a `` violation of the fundamental principles of human rights,'' a ministry spokesman said Tuesday. `` The government also stated that it deplores the attitude of the police against foreign guests,'' said the spokesman, referring to reports that one of a dozen Western participants in the symposium, former <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoel </PERSON>, was manhandled by Czechoslovak police Friday.

<TEXT>
 National Geographic magazine is producing a publishing first in its December magazine, an all-holographic cover. `` Never before has any magazine published an entirely holographic cover; no ink was used on the front, spine or back,'' the magazine reported. It's the third time, however, the magazine has included a hologram _ a three-dimensional photo _ on its cover. It published an eagle in March 1984 and the skull of the prehistoric Taung Child in November 1985. More than 10 million copies of the magazine will be issued with the gold-tinted cover. National Geographic spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffet </PERSON> said Tuesday the cost of the special effect has not been tallied. The cover of the magazine includes the traditional `` National Geographic'' title plus a photo of the globe being shattered. The breaking Earth was chosen to symbolize the theme of the December issue of the magazine, which focuses on the fragile nature of the planet with articles the imperiled rain forest, nature conservation, threats to the arctic and population growth, among others. The photo of the breaking Earth was made by shattering a <LOCATION> Steuben </LOCATION> crystal globe, the magazine reported, using a green laser light to produce the image. The three-dimensional image of the hologram is produced by printing the photo with microscopic ridges _ 20,000 per inch, on rolls of clear plastic. The back cover of the magazine features an advertisement for <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurants, with a holographic photo of one of the chain's restaurants.

 A mother reunited with her premature baby says she forgives the woman who allegedly posed as a nurse and took the 3-day-old boy from her arms at a hospital two weeks ago. `` If she took the baby because of a loss in her own life, I hope that she will have the opportunity to get some help,'' 32-year-old <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas-Jones </PERSON> said Monday, minutes after police returned her son. `` I forgive her.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas-Jones </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 39, showed off the child, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, at a news conference at <LOCATION> Doctors </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where the baby was kidnapped Nov 1. Today, they took the child home. Police retrieved the infant Monday and arrested <PERSON> Acqunetta </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushon </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 32, at Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> home, 50 miles away, following a tip to a hot line. The child was well cared for, authorities said. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an unemployed nurse's aide with four children, was charged with kidnapping. She pleaded innocent at arraignment today in Little Rock Municipal Court, and a preliminary hearing was set for next Tuesday. As she left the hospital today, Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas-Jones </PERSON> said that when she got home with her baby, the youngster would be put to bed for a nap first. `` Then his sisters will probably say, ` Mamma, we're hungry,' so we'll get something for them,'' she said. `` We'll just start our lives with baby <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>.'' The couple have two older daughters. As the family arrived at the house, a man brought a plant that included blue ribbons and a foil balloon on a stick. On the balloon was the word, `` Congratulations.'' The infant was wearing a tiny white T-shirt reading `` Welcome Home'' at the news conference Monday. He appeared no worse for the ordeal. `` The baby obviously was well taken care of,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, a pediatrician. He said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> weighed 5 pounds, 6 ounces Monday, up from 4 pounds when he was kidnapped. `` She took very good care of the baby,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas-Jones </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas-Jones </PERSON> said the prosecution of the kidnapper would not make the family feel any better, but that they would cooperate with authorities. `` I would n't feel better, because I have <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas-Jones </PERSON>, a secretary at the state teachers' union headquarters. `` She -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> -RRB- needs help. ... -LRB- She should -RRB- just ask the Lord to forgive her for what she's done.'' The tip that led police and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents to Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> came from `` a concerned citizen'' who said the baby might be at the woman's home, said Little Rock Detective <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Detectives continued to question Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> late Monday but released no details on a motive. A positive identification of the infant was made through a footprint, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>. Applause broke out from a crowd of about two dozen neighbors and reporters when Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas-Jones </PERSON> and her husband, a real estate agent, emerged from their house on their way to the hospital to be reunited with the infant Monday afternoon. `` Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, hallelujah!'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas-Jones </PERSON> shouted. `` I just want to thank the media,'' she said, tears filling her eyes and her voice breaking. Local broadcasts and newspapers carried repeated appeals by Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas-Jones </PERSON>, her minister and others for information leading to the baby's return. The reports noted that <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> needed continued medical attention because he was six weeks premature at birth Oct. 29. Three days after his birth, Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas-Jones </PERSON> handed the baby over to a woman posing as a nurse who said she needed to weigh the boy, authorities said. A couple who lives across the street from Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> and his wife, said their daughter, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, knew Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> in high school and held the baby last week. They said Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> told their daughter she had the baby and was released from the hospital the same day. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said he did n't believe the story because she did n't look like she had lost weight Another neighbor, <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON>, said Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> looked pregnant in May, when she moved to the area. But she said she never saw a baby. On Monday, a banner at Doctors Hospital read `` Welcome Home, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>'' in baby blue letters, and small baby blue ribbons were handed out to employees and visitors. Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas-Jones </PERSON> said her son `` looks like $ 250 million wrapped up _ not just a million, but $ 250 million. He looks fantastic. He looks like his daddy.'' When she first was reunited with <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, she said, `` I held him and I looked at him and I checked his fingers out and his toes out and his legs and his stomach and his head and everything's there. `` I feel relieved, joyful, thankful,'' she said. `` I knew the Lord was going to bring <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> home for us.''

 Firing chemical shells that caused victims to vomit blood, Soviet and Afghan government soldiers recaptured a key border post and road link with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> from anti-communist guerrillas, insurgents said. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuaib </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION> rebel group said thousands of government and Soviet troops were involved and that hundreds of guerrillas died in the battle before it ended Sunday. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> denied the charge of chemical weapons use, saying neither Soviet nor Afghan government forces have such weapons in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In a state radio broadcast, the Soviet-backed government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said security forces had retaken the <LOCATION> Torkham </LOCATION> post on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, said 140 guerrillas were killed and 150 injured at <LOCATION> Torkham </LOCATION> Monday. Large quantities of weapons and ammunition were also captured, it said. It gave no other details. In another development, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> today requested an emergency meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to stop <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s arming of anti-government rebels and warned it may be forced to use military force in self-defense. The request was made in a letter from <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s foreign minister. Western diplomats on Monday confirmed the presence of Soviet soldiers in the battle for the <LOCATION> Torkham </LOCATION> post and the highway linking <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Diplomats said Soviet soldiers were flown in to join the offensive, presumably from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital about 70 miles to the west. They and most guerrilla informants spoke on condition of anonymity. Insurgents who reached <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, about 30 miles inside <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, claimed Soviet and Afghan forces used chemical weapons. They said explosive shells fired by artillery contained a chemical that caused victims to blister and vomit blood. Moslem rebels began fighting after a Communist coup in April 1978 and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent military forces into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. In April, the Soviets accepted a U.N.-mediated agreement to withdraw their about 100,000 troops. About half the force has gone home, but the Soviets said last week they were suspending the withdrawal and sending new weapons into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> because of continuing guerrilla attacks. They added, however, that they still intend to complete the pullout as scheduled on Feb. 15. The U.S.-backed guerrillas captured <LOCATION> Torkham </LOCATION> Nov. 2 and had claimed they were closing in on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. Both diplomats and rebels said Soviet commandos supported by helicopter gunships moved out of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> on foot, moving along the road to <LOCATION> Torkham </LOCATION>, according to insurgent sources. The official Afghan radio said high military officials visited the post Monday. Insurgents and diplomats said the guerrillas retreated into <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where about 3 million Afghan refugees live. Earlier this month, the government displayed SS-1 Scud missiles in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Advanced MiG-27 ground-attack jets and sophisticated helicopter gunships have been reported in action against the guerrillas. Arrival of the new weapons prompted a guerrilla offensive along the strategic <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway that links <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> with the Soviet border to the north. <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION>'s commander in the <LOCATION> Panjshir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, claims to have closed the highway but <PERSON> Shuaib </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Jamiat </PERSON> said reports from units along the road were sporadic and there was no recent confirmation that it remained closed. The <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway is the only overland route to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was not invited to the White House state dinner for <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, but `` it was not a slight in any way,'' a spokeswoman for first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday. Press Secretary <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said invitations to the state dinner, to be held Wednesday night, were mailed about a month ago _ well before the election _ and that no exceptions to invitation policy were made so that the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator could attend. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, could not immediately be reached for comment. Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said suggested invitations to state dinners are forwarded to <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> social secretary <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> from several quarters, including the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION>. At a typical state dinner, she said, there will be three members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and three members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> among the 126 guests, along with various diplomats, business executives, artists, scientists, musicians and others. Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had been to a state dinner in 1982, but that under the rotation of three senators per dinner _ there are nine such events a year _ his next invitation would still have been a long time coming.

<HEAD>Court Bans Controversial Film in Greek Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A court Tuesday banned `` The Last Temptation of Christ'' from movie theaters in the capital where <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON>, who wrote the book on which the film is based, lived for more than 20 years. The ban came after eight Orthodox Christian organizations claimed the movie insulted religious feeling and defamed the head of the church, said a court spokesman. The court's injuction orders theaters and the film's distributor, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, to suspend screenings or face a fine of nearly $ 700 for each violation, the spokesman said. Last week, a court in the northern city of <LOCATION> Salonica </LOCATION> banned the film before its first showing. Both injuctions will be appealed in higher court. The <LOCATION> Salonica </LOCATION> appeal hearing is set for Nov. 24. No date was set for the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> hearing. `` We were surprised by the decision. Of course we will fight these kinds of decisions,'' said <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalogerakis </PERSON>, a spokesman for the distributor. The Martin Scorsese film, which opened in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> on Oct. 23, is being shown at four movie theaters in the capital area. At its first screening, hundreds of Greek Orthodox priests and faithful slashed movie screens and clashed with riot police. `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' which has been called `` horrifyingly vulgar'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greece </ORGANIZATION>, also has been denounced by other church groups in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON>, who died in 1957, was threatened with excommunication by the <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> when the book was published in 1954. <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON> studied law at <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> university from 1902 to 1906. He lived in the Greek capital for more than 20 years and served in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> as a minister without portfolio shortly after World War II.

 Conductors struck the <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commuter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> this morning in a dispute over pensions, stranding 95,000 suburbanites, but a federal judge ordered the strikers back to work and the union said it would comply. It was the second surprise strike in as many months at the nation's second-largest commuter railroad, which serves the city's northern suburbs extending into <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweet </PERSON> signed a temporary restraining order at 10:15 a.m. and ordered the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> to post a bond of $ 30,000. The railroad is seeking $ 1 million in damages from the union. `` I will not defy it. I'm a law-abiding citizen,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, the union chief. The <ORGANIZATION> UTU </ORGANIZATION> represents 770 <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> conductors. After the strike broke out, all trains were canceled and the entire railroad was shut down as other unions honored the picket lines set up by the conductors. The dispute also disrupted some <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> service. <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stangl </PERSON>, who had called the strike `` outrageous and illegal,'' said that the trains should begin running again at midafteroon. `` We'll have an evening rush -LRB- hour -RRB-,'' he said. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said the union struck because of a dispute about the calculation of pension contributions and the timing of deposits. `` On such a sensitive issue as pension, strict compliance is essential,'' he said. But the railroad insisted it was in compliance. At normally bustling Grand Central Terminal, no trains were arriving, ticket counters were closed and people hoping to leave <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> stood staring at the cancellation notices on the schedule board. `` I've come all the way from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Giusto </PERSON>, who was supposed to attend a 9 a.m. business meeting in north suburban <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>. `` I'm really stranded.'' On the morning of Sept. 9, 780 <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> track workers from the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union staged a surprise strike, but the railroad obtained a court order within hours that ended the walkout. That strike was prompted by the suspension of 37 employees for refusing to work overtime, union officials said.

 Space shuttle managers began a two-day flight readiness review Tuesday to set a date for launching Atlantis on a classified military mission with a crew of five astronauts. The shuttle's processing director, <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagel </PERSON>, said Monday the launch target was Nov. 30, but that Dec. 1 was a more likely date because of a few outstanding technical problems.

The launch will be the second for the shuttle since the Challenger explosion in January 1986 that killed its crew of seven.

<TEXT>
 An osteopath faces a $ 125,000 lawsuit for drawing a cartoon depiction of oral sex on a patient's chest, despite his protest that it was just a joke between friends. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherr </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Spanaway </LOCATION>, accused osteopath <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Havsy </PERSON> of Puyallup of battery, outrage, negligence, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. <PERSON> Scherr </PERSON> claimed the incident awakened memories of having been molested as a teen-ager. A state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> investigation of <PERSON> Havsy </PERSON> also is pending, but <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Braeme </PERSON>, program manager of the health therapies unit, would n't say whether the probe was related to a complaint <PERSON> Scherr </PERSON> filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pierce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION>. The case concerned <PERSON> Scherr </PERSON>'s visit to <PERSON> Havsy </PERSON>'s office Feb. 24, 1987. A defense memorandum said the osteopath and patient had been friends over the years and often told each other jokes. `` At the conclusion of the appointment and in the privacy of his office, -LRB- Havsy -RRB- began the relating of a joke and -LRB- <PERSON> Scherr </PERSON> -RRB- participated therein,'' the memo said. `` Subsequently, -LRB- <PERSON> Scherr </PERSON> -RRB- then went out and publicly displayed his chest. -LRB- He -RRB- also went through elaborate steps to preserve the drawing. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Scherr </PERSON>'s -RRB- actions were designated solely to exploit a joke between friends by turning it into a lawsuit.'' Neither <PERSON> Havsy </PERSON> nor his attorney returned phone calls, and <PERSON> Scherr </PERSON> refused to comment. In a deposition taken this year, however, <PERSON> Scherr </PERSON> gave a different account, saying he told <PERSON> Havsy </PERSON> he was in pain. `` ` I've been in a lot of pain all weekend. Something has to be done. I'm experiencing a lot more pain than I normally have,''' <PERSON> Scherr </PERSON> recounted in the deposition. Havsy then held <PERSON> Scherr </PERSON> down and drew on his chest while laughing, the document says. <PERSON> Scherr </PERSON> said he showed the cartoon to two of <PERSON> Havsy </PERSON>'s employees, then called several attorneys and talked to his father, who persuaded him to have a picture of it taken at a photography studio. His father also traced the design before <PERSON> Scherr </PERSON> washed it off his chest the day it was drawn, he said. The case was set for trial March 20 in <ORGANIZATION> Pierce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

Although the panel found the injuries were not the result of criminal wrongdoing by police or protesters, it recommended extensive changes in police crowd-control methods, grand jury foreman <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said Monday. `` We feel that by better monitoring of the crowd, the whole situation could have been avoided,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said of the Sept. 14 incident that took place outside the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> where <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was campaigning. <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON>, 58, suffered two broken ribs in addition to the ruptured spleen and was in the hospital for almost two weeks. The jury, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said, found that police policies `` were inadequate to deal with what happend.'' <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON> was passing out leaflets about a grape boycott when officers ordered a crowd of nearly 1,000 people to disperse. Union workers claimed the 120-pound woman was struck and jabbed with a police baton. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the jury's findings were based on testimony from witnesses, including <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON>, and a review of police and television videotapes. `` It is disappointing that there is apparently going to be no serious action on the part of the city to discipline the officer responsible for nearly killing <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON>,'' said her attorney, <PERSON> Dianna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>.

 A planetarium whose original projector made viewers dizzy and ill is opening nine years late with a 68-foot-wide dome and a projection system intended to simulate space travel. The Arnim D. Hummel Planetarium officially opens Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` I always thought it would actually happen, but I did n't think it would take as long as it did,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, who was hired 11 years ago as planetarium director. Equipment installed in 1979 projected images so blurred that people who watched test programs became dizzy and nauseated. The university sued the manufacturer of the projection equipment, <ORGANIZATION> Spitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chadds </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. Two years ago, <PERSON> Spitz </PERSON> agreed out of court to replace the original equipment with a new system called Space Voyager In most planetariums, the same projector produces images of the stars and planets. That makes the planetariums `` Earth-bound,'' only able to project the sky as it appears from the Earth. With the Space Voyager system, the projectors are separated, making possible the illusion of space travel. The star-ball projector is 4 feet in diameter and projects 10,164 stars. Each star has a separate lens. There are five planet projectors and a sun projector. Also part of the system are a multiimage slide projector and a six-channel stereo sound system. The system is the third of its kind in the world. The others are in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. The planetarium is named for the first chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s physics department During World War II, <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> was instrumental in developing a radar-activated fuse. The university's planetarium is the 10th-largest of the 985 planetariums in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The largest is the Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, which has a 75-foot dome.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration today rejected a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> proclamation of an independent Palestinian state, asserting that the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict must be settled by negotiations and not by unilateral acts. Spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the status of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> `` can not be determined by unilateral acts of either side but only through a process of negotiations.'' `` A declaration of independent Palestinian statehood is such a unilateral act,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. A similar statement was issued by <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that despite <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opposition to the proclamation of an independent Palestinian state, the administration sees `` positive elements'' to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, most notably its support for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions 224 and 338. These lay the groundwork for a comprehensive settlement to the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the administration has not yet seen the final text of the resolution approved by the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> but promised it would receive serious study. `` Our objective is a comprehensive peace,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` Direct negotiations must be at heart of the negotiating process. Palestinian partiicpation is required at every stage of negotiations. All participants in the negotiations must renounce terrorism and violence and each must agree on the accepted international basis of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions 224 and 338.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said it `` still is not clear just how specific'' the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has been about extending an olive branch to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by implicitly recognizing the Jewish state's right to exist. At the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> meeting, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s quasi-legislature voted to accept <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 242, which established the principle that all states in the region _ including <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ are entitled to exist in peace. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Monday that <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> acceptance of the resolution, which long has been the cornerstone of international efforts to secure a lasting peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, `` would be some progress.'' But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` there are other problems that remain to be solved'' before there is a breakthrough in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s stance toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He was not more specific. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke before the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> proclaimed a new independent Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as its capital. Apart from accepting the 1967 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy requires the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to renounce terrorism and to nullify the provision in its covenant calling for the destruction of the Jewish state. Otherwise, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are not supposed to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> or support its participation in any <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday released a `` fact sheet'' detailing attacks on Israelis attributed to the Popular Front for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. The group, which has its headquarters in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, is believed to have opposed approval of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. `` Apparently there has been an indication they're willing to abide by 242,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s approach to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution, adopted after the 1967 <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> war, that implicitly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to live within secure borders `` I hope that is true because that would be some progress,'' he said during a picture-taking session in the Oval Office with <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, the Soviet human rights activist. The resolution, which was adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> again in 1973, at the end of the Yom Kippur war, also calls on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to relinquish territory lost by the Arabs in 1967. Asked Monday whether an international peace conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> could represent a solution to the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> dispute, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, `` I'm still not sure that that is the answer.'' Earlier this year, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cautiously supported efforts to arrange such a peace conference. However, officials stressed that any settlement depended on direct negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its Arab neighbors.

<HEAD>Study Says Emergency Heart Procedure Unnecessary After Heart
Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The expensive practice of using balloon catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart attacks, now routinely done at many large hospitals, is unnecessary and should be abandoned, according to a major study released Tuesday. The study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive clot-dissolving drugs, they usually do n't need the extra step of the common balloon procedure, known as angioplasty. Some experts said the results are good news, because they mean that most heart attack patients can be treated in community hospitals, where angioplasty is not available. The study also has an important financial message. Its authors estimated that if angioplasty was widely adopted after heart attacks, it could raise the nation's annual medical bills by $ 704 million. `` This trial has settled one of the most important questions in modern-day cardiology,'' commented Dr. J. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. The study is phase 2 of the Thrombolysis in Miocardial Infarction Trial, or TIMI-II, directed by Dr. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Braunwald </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The first phase of the study showed that giving people a clot-dissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, immediately after heart attacks dramatically improved their chances of survival. The latest study, presented at the annual meeting of the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, was intended to see whether people did better still if doctors tried to clear away any remaining blockages after giving TPA. At 50 hospitals across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, doctors randomly assigned 1,636 patients to get angioplasty within two days of their heart attacks if tests showed there was any chance they might benefit. Sixty percent of them actually underwent the procedure, which temporarily inflates balloons in dangerously narrowed heart arteries to squeeze them open. A comparison group of 1,626 also got TPA. But they were not considered for angioplasty unless they had lingering heart pain or abnormal exercise tests during their recovery. After 42 days, 11 percent of those in the angioplasty group had died or suffered further heart attacks, as did 10 percent of those in the comparison group. A year after the treatment, there was no difference in survival. About 93 percent of both groups were still alive. `` There does not appear to be any additional benefit from angioplasty,'' <PERSON> Braunwald </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> commented, `` We have the answer in this trial to a very important question of health care delivery.'' While small hospitals can give clot-dissolving drugs to heart attack patients, most of them do not have the sophisticated labs where angioplasty is performed. If the study had found that immediate angioplasty improves survival, it would have meant that many more angioplasty labs would need to be established and more doctors trained to give the procedure. `` The watch word is watchful waiting'' to see if patients need angioplasty. `` This ultimately makes it possible for patients to be treated in community hospitals and be transfered to terciary care centers if angioplasty is needed,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, immediate past president of the heart association. Heart attacks occur when a clot blocks an artery that feeds the heart muscle. The purpose of TPA and similar drugs is to dissolve these clots before the muscle dies. To be effective, the drugs must be given within about four hours of the start of heart attack symptoms. Experts say that only about 20 percent of heart attack victims are considered to be candidates for the drugs. Many people delay going to the hospital until permanent damage occurs. In others, the treatment may be considered too dangerous because of recent surgery or a history of strokes. Balloon angioplasty is also widely used to treat people with clogged heart arteries who have not suffered heart attacks. The latest study did not question the usefulness of this kind of angioplasty.

<HEAD>U.S. Urges Freeze on World Farm Price Supports, Subsidies in Two
Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to reform world agricultural trade, beginning with a freeze on all farm price supports, subsidies and trade barriers in the next two years, a White House report said Tuesday. The proposal, dated Nov. 7, was made as part of the current <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of trade talks under the 96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Those talks began in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> in 1986 and are scheduled to conclude in 1990. Earlier, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> proposed the elimination of farm subsidies and other <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> reforms by the year 2000 but has been criticized heatedly by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Under the latest proposal, which was released by the office of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would agree to the freeze in 1989 and 1990 in return for a commitment from other countries to `` eliminate all measures that directly or indirectly affect trade'' and to write new rules that are based on free trade principles. The new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan is scheduled to be taken up during a mid-term negotiating session beginning Dec. 5 in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. According to the proposal, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also is seeking `` a commitment to undertake specific reforms that would bring all agricultural trade into compliance'' with new <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> rules within a period of time agreed upon by the negotiators. No deadline, such as the year 2000 in the previous <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan, was mentioned in the new version. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said in October that a short-term or interim agreement for 1989 and 1990 would be desirable for all of the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> countries and get the reform process in motion. But <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> added that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` is not about to embark on this proposition unless we also receive a satisfactory commitment to long-term reform.'' In seeking the full liberlization of agricultural trade, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal called upon trade ministers meeting in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> next month to undertake `` fundamental policy reforms, within an agreed upon period of time, that would bring all countries into compliance'' with free-trade principles. Those principles, the proposal said, include the elimination of `` all market access barriers and thereby provide treatment for imports no less favorable than the treatment accorded domestic commodities and products.'' Further, it said, the objective would be `` to eliminate all direct and indirect subsidies that directly or indirectly affect trade.'' However, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal would allow some exemptions of policies that do not affect trade, including: _ Direct income of other payments to farmers that are unrelated to production and marketing, including those that provide a safety net against natural disaster or other extraordinary circumstances _ Bona fide foreign and domestic food aid programs According to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan, once the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> trade ministers agree to the proposed reforms, the freeze on agricultural `` support, subsidies and protection'' could be worked out for 1989 and 1990. The freeze would entail surveillance to ensure compliance by each country. Also, <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> members would pledge `` not to introduce or undertake any new measures nor any other measures that would circumvent the objectives of the freeze.''

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s Latin community is reporting a sharp increase in anti-Hispanic incidents since the overwhelming passage last week of the official English amendment. Amendment 11, which makes English the official language of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> but leaves implementation to the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, received an 84 percent `` yes'' vote in the Nov. 8 statewide election. Since the election, a supermarket employee was suspended for speaking Spanish to another employee, the mayor of <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION> was quoted as making derogatory remarks about his Hispanic opponent and children in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> high school complained they were forbidden to speak Spanish in school. `` What has happened is that people have taken the law into their own hands and are enforcing it as they see fit,'' <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discrimination </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. `` I knew Amendment 11 would bring chaos to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> said his organization has received calls from dozens of people saying some stores refused to help Spanish-speaking customers. Supporters of the initiative say it does only what it is supposed to do. They believe the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> will implement the law despite complaints from Hispanics and the opposition of most state politicians, including Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s Cuban community has interpreted the official English vote as a direct slap in the face. One Spanish radio station mockingly insisted everyone on a popular talk show speak English the day after the election, hanging up on Spanish-speakers who called in to complain about the new law. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Uzal </PERSON>, who led the anti-Amendment 11 drive in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said many supporters there were open about their reasons for favoring the measure. In a Monday talk show on an English-language station, <PERSON> Uzal </PERSON> said, `` callers were telling me this was certainly an anti-Hispanic amendment, and that's why they voted for it.'' Two days after the election, in the most highly publicized incident blamed on the ballot measure, a supermarket manager in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION> suspended a cashier for speaking Spanish to another employee. Store administrators later apologized for the incident; the manager is being transferred. Over the weekend, Coral Gables Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON> was quoted as saying he was more qualified than his opponent, city Commissioner <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdes </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauli </PERSON>, because his rival is a Latin who likes to sleep late and misses commission meetings. On Monday, parents met in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> met with officials at <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> when their children said an assistant principal banned them from speaking Spanish in the hallways. <PERSON> Uzal </PERSON> said the assistant principal, <PERSON> May </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON>, told him she prohibited the language because students had been using profanity. School principal <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Picklesmier </PERSON>, however, told <PERSON> Uzal </PERSON> and the parents that the school has no such policy. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> LaPorta </PERSON>, coordinator of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> English </LOCATION> campaign, called such incidents meaningless, and blamed them on the media. `` That's a mistake and an over-reaction,'' said <PERSON> LaPorta </PERSON>. `` There is great hypersensitivity now, and I think that will go down.'' <PERSON> LaPorta </PERSON> is acutely aware of the hypersensitivity. During a conciliatory post-election news conference aimed at calming fears about the amendment, his own supporters interrupted him, grabbed his microphone and called him a traitor when he said <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s anti-bilingual ordinance could be scrapped under the new law

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Tuesday promptly agreed to a nationally televised debate on the issue of union pluralism with the head of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s official trade union alliance. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, member of the ruling Politburo and chairman of the OPZZ, the <ORGANIZATION> All-Poland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>, had challenged <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to the debate in an interview in Tuesday's edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Trybuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludu </ORGANIZATION>. `` In connection with <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>'s proposal ... concerning a public meeting, I state that I accept it,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he had authorized Solidarity national spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> and historian <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>, a veteran adviser to the banned union, to make the arrangements. Although all the parties involved seemed to agree on the idea of holding the debate, it was unclear who would take the next step. `` All members of the government will be glad to sit in front of their TV sets and listen to such a discussion,'' government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said at his weekly news conference. The developments appeared to catch senior television officials by surprise. <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Slabicki </PERSON>, deputy chairman of the state <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he knew nothing about the proposal, but did not exclude the possibility that the debate would take place. `` If there is to be a round table in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, such things are not out of the question,'' <PERSON> Slabicki </PERSON> said, referring to talks promised by the authorities during the August strikes to discuss the future of Solidarity. The talks are stalled over government objections to the proposed participation of <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> and Solidarity adviser <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>. Another broadcast official appeared excited about the possibility of a TV encounter between <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>. `` It would be great. Two good partners would meet,'' said <PERSON> Marek </PERSON> <PERSON> Tumanowicz </PERSON>, deputy news director for state television. `` It would be very exciting. If we announced for example that on Friday after the news we were going to broadcast such a debate, I am sure the streets would be totally empty.'' <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> has headed the official unions since they were set up by the government in 1982 after the authorities banned Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first independent trade union. Solidarity and the OPZZ hold opposing views on the number and organization of trade unions within factories and on the shop floor. Solidarity supporters say more than one union should be allowed to exist in each workplace because the OPZZ unions do n't adequately represent workers' interests. It would be <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s first appearance on state TV since 1983, when <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> challenged then-Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> during a televised speech at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> became prime minister in September. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said a public discussion <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> was long overdue. `` I do want to talk about trade union pluralism, but without any adjectives. But I've been asking for a public debate for seven years. ... Please do n't attribute this to Mr. <PERSON> Miodowiz </PERSON>. It's me who has been asking for it.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Tuesday told 3,000 workers in the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> he will support management plans to restructure the yard and he is satisfied the plans will save most of its jobs. The government had announced that the shipyard, the birthplace of Solidarity, would be liquidated beginning Dec. 1, but now concedes it will take 1 -LCB- years to close it. The government has said the closure is needed for economic reasons, but Solidarity has said there should have been greater consultations with the workforce and the announcement was a veiled attack on Solidarity.

 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s president told the nation police and soldiers would be out in force Wednesday to prevent anyone from creating `` an atmosphere of fear or danger'' during National Assembly elections. In a televised address Tuesday night, <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> urged the 48 million voters to participate in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s first open election for more than a decade and to accept the outcome peacefully. <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, who has served on an interim basis since President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> was killed in a plane crash three months ago, said his government had done its best to ensure a free and fair vote. A bomb killed a man Tuesday in <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION> and police in the northern city said another was found unexploded. No one claimed responsibility and officials would not speculate about whether the bombs were related to the election. Gen. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ruled by martial law for eight years after seizing power in 1977 and did not allow political parties to run candidates in elections held after that. About 30 parties have entered Wednesday's races for parliament seats Most are small or regional and the election is expected to be a contest between <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, populist leader of the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> People's Party founded by her father, and the nine-party conservative <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> involving many <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> loyalists. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father, Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, was the man <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> overthrew in 1977. He was convicted of complicity in a murder plot and hanged in 1979. Election officials delivered ballots, boxes and government stamps Tuesday to about 33,500 polling stations. Voters must present government-issued identity cards in order to cast ballots. Soldiers in armored vehicles and sandbagged bunkers stood guard in <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hyderabad </LOCATION>, southern cities where nearly 300 people were killed in ethnic riots two months ago. Police and paramilitary forces checked cars for bombs and weapons. Of the 217 National Assembly seats at stake in the election, 207 will be filled by Moslems and 10 will go to members chosen by non-Moslem voters. The other 20 seats are reserved for women and will be filled later by vote of the assembly. <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> will chose a member of the assembly, presumably the leader of the strongest party, to become prime minister and form a government. On Saturday, voters will elect the 483 members of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s four provincial assemblies. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> held national elections on a non-party basis in 1985 that were boycotted by the <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> party and other opposition groups. Last May, he dismissed Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> and dissolved the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, alleging corruption and failure to implement Islamic law. The general was killed Aug. 17, along with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador and 28 other people, in the crash of a military transport plane. An initial report left open the possibility of sabotage but the cause of the crash has not been determined. A 25-member international delegation sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, an affiliate of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is to monitor voting on an unofficial basis. A report from the institute after a delegation visited <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> last month said a `` comprehensive framework for procedurally correct elections has been devised.''

<HEAD>Energy Efficiency of Economy Better Than Thought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The energy efficiency of the economy appears to be slowly improving again after a year of stagnation, despite an earlier forecast that it would worsen in the short term, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. According to the department's <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, analysts have discovered major errors, namely significant overstatements of natural gas use by American industry, behind the previous projection. Correction of the natural gas error means the nation's energy efficiency is actually improving, though more slowly than in the past, the <ORGANIZATION> EIA </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency's `` Short-Term Energy Outlook'' publication in in July projected a worsening of the ratio from 19,960 BTUs per dollar of gross national product in 1987 -LRB- expressed in dollars of 1982 buying power -RRB- to 20,180 in 1988, followed by a slight improvement to 20,050 in 1989. The October revision puts 1988 efficiency at 19,840 BTUs per dollar, a gain of 0.6 percent, with 1989 efficiency projected at 19,590, a further gain of 1.3 percent. Many analysts pay close attention to how much energy the economy uses to produce a dollar's worth of goods and services. Environmentalists use that ratio as an indicator of how much damage the environment might be subject to from economic activity; policymakers take it as a gauge of the vulnerability of the economy to future interruptions on oil imports. Last year was the first since 1976 the ratio had failed to improve. Energy price increases of the late 1970s had set off a global scramble to boost efficiency, and, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, led to average annual rate of improvement of about 1.1 percent in the 1970s and 2.8 percent in the period 1980-1986. Oil prices, though, collapsed in 1986, leading many analysts to conclude that companies stopped looking so hard for ways to use less energy _ heat, electricity, petroleum or whatever _ in producing their products. The <ORGANIZATION> EIA </ORGANIZATION>'s October report said that 43 companies delivering natural gas to industrial users `` have consistently misreported their monthly industrial'' deliveries following introduction of a new reporting form in January. `` This resulted in an overstatement of industrial consumption in the first six months of 1988 of 0.5 trillion cubic feet,'' about 16 percent of now-estimated industrial consumption for the first half of the year, the <ORGANIZATION> EIA </ORGANIZATION> said. Natural gas accounts for 23 percent of all forms of energy use.

<TEXT>
 A chance remark at a Parisian dinner party two years ago led to the discovery of a long-lost collection of rare Islamic art that will go on public display Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sackler </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallery </PERSON>. The collection assembled by <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Vever </PERSON>, a turn-of-the-century jeweler and art collector in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, is `` perhaps the most important purchase in the history of the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McC </PERSON>. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. The 500 items in <PERSON> Vever </PERSON>'s collection of richly detailed paintings, manuscripts, calligraphies and bookbindings from ancient <LOCATION> Persia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and other major artistic centers of the <LOCATION> Near </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> were bought for $ 7 million. <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> officials say their real worth is much, much more, but that the collection is priceless in scope and quality. Drawn from the <PERSON> Vever </PERSON> collection are 150 items that will be displayed at the <LOCATION> Sackler </LOCATION>, many of them for the first time anywhere, from Sunday through April 30 in a show titled, `` A Jeweler's Eye: Islamic Arts of the Book from the Vever Collection.'' An hour-long `` Smithsonian World'' television special on <PERSON> Vever </PERSON> and his collection will be broadcast on public TV stations next March. <PERSON> Vever </PERSON>'s collection includes almost all of the great classical Persian texts, several important Arabic works and previously unknown manuscripts and paintings from major artistic centers of the Near East and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The art works, some dating to the 11th century, reflect the reverence for the written word in medieval Islam, stemming from the holy scriptures of the prophet <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> known as the Koran. The ruling elite built libraries of lavishly illuminated books and manuscripts as symbols of their cultural sophistication. <PERSON> Vever </PERSON>'s collection includes brilliant paintings in which the pigments were ground from minerals, precious stones and metals, an irresistible attraction to the jeweler and his contemporary, <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartier </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> officials say the only comparable collection in the world is housed at the <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beatty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Library </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vever </PERSON>'s collection disappeared in the late 1930s during the German occupation of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vever </PERSON> himself died in 1942, and the whereabouts of his collection remained a mystery for nearly half a century. Then, during a small dinner party in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in November 1984, <PERSON> Laure </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Williamstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, found herself seated next to <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mautin </PERSON>, a wealthy, elderly sportsman and naturalized American, who casually disclosed a momentous secret. <PERSON> Mautin </PERSON> said he was <PERSON> Vever </PERSON>'s grandson and had inherited a major collection of Islamic art, which was shipped intact from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after World War II for safekeeping. There it remained, stored in a vault known only to <PERSON> Mautin </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> telephoned the news to her son, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON>, curator of Near Eastern art at the Freer Gallery of Art and the yet-unbuilt <PERSON> Sackler </PERSON> gallery. <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> was dumbfounded. He and <PERSON> Milo </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON>, now acting director of the <PERSON> Sackler </PERSON>, raced to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and won <PERSON> Mautin </PERSON>'s commitment to sell the collection to the Smithsonian. <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> were the first scholars to see the collection, by then moved to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, in 50 years. Among the well-preserved items hidden in trunks and stacked against walls was a surprise _ 39 full manuscripts previously unknown to scholars except for a handful that were exhibited in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 1931. The $ 7 million purchase was financed by various Smithsonian trust and acquisition funds and private donors, including the late Dr. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sackler </PERSON>, chief benefactor of the underground museum that opened in September 1987.

 The woman sought in the deaths of seven elderly people whose bodies were dug up from the yard of her rooming house had told police she `` never killed anybody'' when she was questioned last week, court documents say. Police who found the sixth and seventh bodies in shallow graves Monday were expanding a search for bodies beyond the yard of the rooming house. Digging resumed this morning, and officers also searched the house. A warrant charging the boarding home's landlady, <PERSON> Dorothea </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalvo </PERSON> <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>, 59, with one count of murder was issued late Monday, said police Capt. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Somers </PERSON>. Police questioned her Friday, the day the first body was discovered, and released her Saturday morning for lack of evidence. `` Our first priority is to get her into custody,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. According to sworn statements that police filed to obtain the warrant, <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> twice denied killing her missing tenants, saying, `` I have never killed anybody.'' But the affidavits said that one of her tenants, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, handed a detective a note that said, `` She's making me lie.'' Sharp later told police that one resident disappeared after he had caused a drunken ruckus and `` <PERSON> Dorothea </PERSON> told him that she would take him upstairs and make him better.'' About four days later, police said, <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> `` smelled a very strong odor of what he thought was death in the kitchen area.'' <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> told him the stench was caused by some faulty sewers. Investigators using shovels, steel probes and a tractor found the two bodies wrapped in cloth or clothes in the yard of the two-story Victorian house, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. The bodies found Monday, one unearthed in the front yard under a flower bed and the other in the side yard under a shed, are unidentified, like the five others. `` We'll continue to dig, and we wo n't stop digging until we've dug up every square inch of this yard,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said The arrest warrant charged <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> only with the slaying of <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, a mentally disabled transient who lived in the boarding house. A search warrant for the house was also issued Monday. The <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> Bee reported today that police in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> had been told <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> may be there. Investigators planned to excavate the rest of the yard at the rooming house and comb an adjacent lot that <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> gardened when it was vacant several years ago, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. In 1982, <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> was convicted of drugging and robbing three people in a bar, and sentenced to five years in prison, authorities said. She was paroled after 2 -LCB- years, said <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. Police said they were uncertain about the cause of death or even the sexes of the victims found Monday. No cause of death was determined for the other victims, police said. The list of possible victims lengthened during the day. `` There are a lot more than eight names,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said, referring to the original list of occupants supplied by a social worker. `` There's a big list of names. We've got detectives scurrying all over this city.'' <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> also ran a board-and-care home up to nine years ago about eight blocks away. A separate team of investigators was interviewing tenants at that address but there were no immediate plans to dig there, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. Police Lt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Enloe </PERSON> said investigators believed the elderly victims were killed for their Social Security checks. Payments continued to be sent after the disappearances and someone else cashed the checks, he said. Police went to the house after neighbors reported a friend had been missing since August and a social worker said some of her clients were missing. A social worker familiar with the rooming house described the residents as elderly people on fixed incomes and with few relatives. The case worker, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickerson </PERSON>, told police <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> came to her in 1986, offering lodging. <PERSON> Nickerson </PERSON> said she took up <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>'s offer, and during the past two years referred 19 clients to <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> `` She was the best the system had to offer,'' <PERSON> Nickerson </PERSON> said. `` She said she was a widow and had a big house, and she said it was her time to give back to other people. ... That was her story and I did n't have any reason to doubt her.'' <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, described her mother as someone who had a `` terrible childhood'' and was raised in orphanages. Bloom, of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, met her mother for the first time two years ago after being put up for adoption herself at birth. She said <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> was `` not animated at all'' and spoke in a monotone. On Sunday, police arrested <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCauley </PERSON>, a 59-year-old resident of the boarding house, on suspicion of being an accessory after the homicides. He was being held at the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail. Authorities believe <PERSON> McCauley </PERSON> assisted <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> after the slayings, and that she may have arranged for others to dig the graves, police said.

 <LOCATION> PEAPACK-GLADSTONE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ He may be a reigning monarch, but the king of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> is just another gentleman farmer in the eyes of the <LOCATION> Somerset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> tax board. The board ruled Monday that the evaluation on <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s 322-acre estate in the borough of <ORGANIZATION> Peapack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gladstone be reduced from $ 25.8 million to $ 7.3 million That means the king's property taxes for 1988 will be lowered from $ 204,591 to $ 57,764. County officials agreed with arguments by the king's representatives that 225 acres of the property should be reassessed as farmland because it is used to grow corn and hay, and breed cattle The evaluation on the remaining 97 acres also was reduced. `` He is using the land as a farm and has produced income from that land,'' said tax board member <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevins </PERSON>. `` He's produced receipts. He's entitled to it just like anybody else.'' Neighbors say they have never seen the king at the heavily wooded estate and no one knows if he has ever visited it.

 Spiders give most people the willies, but for a biology professor who collects the critters and whose students call him `` Spiderman,'' having a spider named for him is an honor. `` I certainly would n't call it an attractive spider, but I'm very flattered,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a professor of biology at <ORGANIZATION> Hope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> for 22 years who has about 3,000 spiders in his office. One of <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s former students discovered the previously unnamed spider recently and has proposed that it be named Cyclocosmia bradyi. The name and description will be submitted to the Journal of Arachnology for publication. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>, a 1974 Hope graduate who teaches biology at <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, found the spider in collections of unidentified material from the Illinois Historical Survey. He said it comes from <LOCATION> Guerrero </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> calls himself `` a champion of spiders,'' saying most people do n't appreciate their insect-control capabilities. `` We really should appreciate spiders.''

 Some people have elaborate weddings in gardens or banquet halls, and some have a ceremony with a gimmick _ such as exchanging vows on horseback or while scuba diving. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamblen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, both 30, chose to tie the knot simply, at lunchtime, while guests clad in work clothes leaned on ladders, ate sandwiches and sipped sodas. <PERSON> Hamblen </PERSON>, a union carpenter in the midst of setting up for a convention at the <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, snuck away from work shortly before noon Monday to trade his jeans for a black suit with a boutonniere. Moments later, to the accompaniment of the sounds of saws and hammers, several friends sang `` Here Comes the Bride'' while Ms. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> walked through construction rubble to meet <PERSON> Hamblen </PERSON> at a makeshift altar. <PERSON> Hamblen </PERSON> said it was the only way he could fit a wedding into his schedule. `` He has to go back to work this afternoon,'' his new wife explained.

<HEAD>Authorities To Experiment with Radio Wave Toll Collection</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A new electronic toll system that will `` read'' a special automobile tag may help motorists whiz by toll booths, under an experiment planned by two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-area </LOCATION> authorities. The number of times a vehicle goes through the toll would be recorded by computer and a monthly bill charged to a credit card. The new system, called automatic vehicle identification or AVI, uses a radio frequency beam transmitter mounted in each lane that will read a unique serial number up to 20 digits from a tag mounted on each vehicle. A similar system now being experimented with in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> is working well, officials there said. The <ORGANIZATION> Triborough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tunnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> hopes to experiment with the new system at the <LOCATION> Verrazano-Narrows </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> _ a span between <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> that carries about 58 million vehicles a year _ beginning early next year, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> TBTA </ORGANIZATION>'s project manager for AVI, said Monday However, the experiment, which could cost up to $ 1.4 million, must first be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> TBTA </ORGANIZATION>'s parent agency. If approved, tags would be fitted on vehicles belonging to some trucking companies as well as vehicles belonging to <ORGANIZATION> TBTA </ORGANIZATION> employees and <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> buses that use the bridge, according to <ORGANIZATION> TBTA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which is experimenting with a similar system for buses at the <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tunnel </LOCATION>, plans to use the same trucking companies for its experiment at the <LOCATION> Goethals </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrastia </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The Goethals Bridge connects <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. In addition, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnpike </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thruway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> are all committed to using the same AVI system. The decision to use the Verrazano-Narrows and <PERSON> Goethals </PERSON> bridges was made because `` a lot of the traffic would be the same,'' <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> said. Many long-distance truckers cross <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to avoid <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` The speed of proccessing at the toll booths is the main advantage'' of the system, <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said. `` It will reduce the need to handle cash, tickets and tokens.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> transportation officials are optimistic about the system because of good results from a similar experiment in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnpike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> that started last summer. `` It's coming along very well,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabler </PERSON>, a spokesman for the authority. The <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> experiment is being conducted on the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tollway </ORGANIZATION> and is currently limited to employees of <ORGANIZATION> AmTech </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, one of two companies that has developed the automated system. The Tollway is a heavily traveled, 20-mile-long highway between downtown <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and its northern suburbs.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declared the Berlin Wall `` a litmus test of East-West relations'' today as he held a farewell meeting with West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, responding through a translator at a departure ceremony on the White House lawn, thanked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for his efforts to improve relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Any kind of worsening in <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations will be felt like an earthquake in our country, and of course first of all in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who will leave office Jan. 20, said, `` The divided city of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> remains a powerful symbol of a divided <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and a litmus test of East-West relations.'' The two leaders, who have been close allies, exchanged personal best wishes along with discussion of issues. `` These have been good years,'' said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. `` Both of us have paved the way for a development that will be pursued by your successor in office.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> met with President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later in the day at the vice president's residence. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> meets with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, whom he said Monday he respects more than any other world leader he has met. Answering a question from a junior high school student as to whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would ever have a woman president, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he thought it was inevitable. `` As a matter of fact, the statesman in the world that I have met that I respect the most is the Prime Minister of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>,'' he said. `` And she's done a remarkable job for <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, columnist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Walden </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> wrote, `` We must brace ourselves for a Niagara of mutual admiration. The personal relationship has indeed been special.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is scheduled to meet on Thursday with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who will be sworn in as president on Jan. 20. There have been reports from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that the prime minister would bring with her a proposal for an early meeting of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders. A senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said, `` We have nothing specific from the British in the course of planning this visit that said the prime minister would be bringing along a proposal of this kind, but we certainly would n't be surprised if such a proposal came.'' April 4 will be the 40th anniversary of the signing of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION>, and such decade anniversaries have been observed in the past by turning the annual spring ministerial meeting of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> into a heads of government meeting. `` We had heard that, as <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, which is to be the site of the spring ministerial, considered planning for that spring ministerial in the 40th anniversary year, that some thought was being given to that meeting being a summit,'' the official said. The meeting will be in late May or early June. A West German official who briefed a reporter on condition of anonymity said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s visit would enable him again `` to congratulate the president-elect and to see with him what the immediate tasks for both countries are.'' Both the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and West German officials said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> was expected to discuss <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> relations with the president and to report on his own meetings with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> officials last month. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last met with both <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> at the seven-nation economic summit in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> last June. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> was last in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in February and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> in July of 1987.

 Confessed <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> fell ill during his trial Tuesday, forcing the judge to interrupt emotional testimony by a former American hostage. The trial was adjourned until Monday after a doctor examined <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> and ruled the defendant was unable to follow the proceedings. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and air piracy in the June 1985 hijacking of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight 847, which was diverted on an Athens-to-Rome route and forced to land in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> told the court he was feeling `` very exhausted'' and `` very dizzy.'' The session was adjourned for nearly an hour while he was examined by a doctor, who told the court <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was suffering from dizzy spells and a headache. Circulation irregularities were blamed for the symptoms and <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was given a shot of glucose, said the doctor, who was not identified by the court. She said <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> had been eating very little and taking medicine to counter low blood pressure. The session was interrupted during the testimony of <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, a 48-year-old American physician, who said he was returning from a vacation in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> with his wife and two daughters when the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> plane was seized. He described how he got up to go to a restroom and tried to find his wife among the passengers. `` I looked everywhere on the plane but she was n't there,'' <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said, his voice choked with emotion. `` First I thought she might have been killed, but then a stewardess told me she had been released from the plane,'' he said. Some of the passengers were released while the plane was in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> also testified how the hijackers robbed his wife of her jewelry, which he valued `` in excess of $ 50,000.'' <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said one of the hijackers `` lectured us on the evils of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and it went on and on.'' Like more than a dozen other American witnesses at the trial, <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> also described the brutal beatings of passengers by the hijackers. He said he had given a woman passenger an insulin shot, but that the hijackers had refused his request to examine two men who were severely beaten. `` They lay unconscious and looked dead. One had blood on his shirt,'' <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>'s 21-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Marypat </PERSON>, who testified earlier in the day, said she still suffers nightmares more than three years after the ordeal. `` I have had nightmares and I'm scared of flying on planes,'' she said. She also told the court she thought <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> directed the hijacking. `` I personally felt that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was more in charge and that he was the leader,'' she said. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> admits he was one of the hijackers but denies killing <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> or robbing the passengers. He says the hijacking was directed by his accomplice, fugitive <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezzeddine </PERSON>, who is at large. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport in January 1987 when customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.

<HEAD>Spurt In Retail Sales Spurs Inflation Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Retail sales shot up 0.9 percent in October, the strongest increase in seven months, the government said Tuesday in a report that heightened inflation fears in the financial markets. Boosted by gains at department stores and auto dealerships, sales rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 135.6 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. It also revised its figures for the two previous months, showing a brisker sales pace than previously thought. In response, bond prices fell Tuesday morning. Traders saw the report as a sign of inflation. Too much consumer demand can strain factory capacity, causing a shortage of goods and higher prices. It also could encourage more imports and retard progress on whittling the nation's trade gap. However, bond traders were hoping for good news on Wednesday with the release of the merchandise trade deficit for September. Most economists expect a decline in imports to narrow the September deficit to $ 9.5 billion to $ 11 billion, down from $ 12.2 billion in August. In another economic report Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said its index of industrial production increased a moderately strong 0.4 percent in October, the biggest gain in three months. `` These numbers give a much different picture than just a month ago. Some people were betting the expansion would die of old age. These numbers refute that strongly,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But, he said the unexpected strength has rekindled concern about inflation, which had waned as growth cooled in August and September. `` There's the perception that in response, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will move to tighten credit at least modestly, pushing up interest rates,'' he said. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the reports `` are both very positive and very encouraging for continued steady growth in the economy.'' `` We see no evidence of rekindling inflation,'' he added. In the latest report, the government said retail sales fell 0.3 percent in September, up from an earlier estimate of a 0.4 percent decline, and rose 0.3 percent in August, rather than falling 0.1 percent as previously thought. The October increase of 0.9 percent was the steepest since March, when sales shot up 1.6 percent. Most economists had been expecting a milder rise of about 0.3 percent last month. Auto sales in October jumped 1.7 percent to $ 29.2 billion, after falling 2.2 percent a month earlier. However, it was only the second increase since March. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the pattern of retail buying is shifting from `` hard goods,'' such as autos and appliances, to `` soft goods,'' such as clothing, as the year winds up. Clothing sales were lackluster earlier this year partly because of high prices and partly because women rejected new fashions, she said. `` I think there is some pent up demand out there,'' she said. `` A lot of women were just waiting it out through two years of merchandise that was not appropriate for work.'' Excluding the automotive category, which is the most volatile, sales rose 0.7 percent last month after a 0.2 percent increase in September. Sales at department and other general merchandise stores shot up 2.4 percent to $ 15.6 billion last month, following a 0.8 percent gain in September. Hardware, garden and building-supply stores reported no change in October after a 0.8 percent rise a month earlier. Furniture stores posted a modest 0.2 percent gain after falling 0.3 percent in September. Food and grocery stores reported a 1.1 percent gain, gasoline stations a 1.2 percent jump, specialty clothing stores a 1.3 percent increase, and drug stores a 0.6 percent rise. The only category reporting a decline was restaurants and bars, down 0.2 percent after a 1.3 percent increase in September. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, noting that the sales figures are not adjusted for inflation, said much of the increases for food, gasoline, clothing and autos can be attributed to higher prices. For the first 10 months of the year, overall sales were up 6.1 percent over the same period of 1987, barely keeping ahead of the inflation rate.

<TEXT>
 A stunning election upset by <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s nationalists illustrates deepening Scottish dislike for the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> political establishment and could breathe new life into the campaign for independence Thursday's election in the <LOCATION> Govan </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> was to fill a vacant seat in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, and since such by-elections are traditionally an occasion for registering protest votes, the result can not be accurately projected over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> as a whole. But it is a spectacular victory for the <ORGANIZATION> Scottish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks independence for <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, and a humiliation for the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the opposition in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> but the dominant force north of the English border. In one of the biggest upsets in 40 years of British politics, the <ORGANIZATION> SNP </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sillars </PERSON> won 14,677 votes aginst 11,123 for Labor's <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, a 38-percent swing from the June 1987 general election, when <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> took <PERSON> Govan </PERSON> by a massive 19,509-vote majority. It was almost a rerun of 1973, when <PERSON> Sillars </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, staged a similar upset in Govan for the SNP. By the following year, after two general elections, the bandwagon effect had taken nationalist strength in the 650-member House of Commons from two seats to 11. By last year, however, the <ORGANIZATION> SNP </ORGANIZATION> was down to three seats. Now the question is whether the latest result is a freak, or the precursor of a 1970s-style revival. `` The Scottish people will now start marching towards their destiny as an independent country with an independent economy,'' <PERSON> Sillars </PERSON>, 51, declared to cheering supporters after the result was announced in the heavily blue-collar constituency. `` It's a pretty substantial blip,'' conceded Scottish Laborite <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Home </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. He warned Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> that `` If she's not careful, and if this sort of bandwagon gets going, she could actually split up the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>.'' But the Conservatives, having harbored no expectations in <LOCATION> Govan </LOCATION>, felt little disappointment with their paltry 2,207 votes, preferring instead to mock <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s defeat. `` Last night must be the first by-election where the protest vote has been against the opposition rather than the government,'' taunted Tory government minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s yen to end its 281-year-old union with <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> ebbs and flows. Right now, says Professor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellas </PERSON>, a political scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Glasgow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, `` there is a trend of Scottish nationalism rising.'' One reason is a widespread Scottish perception of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> as a thoroughly English prime minister with no understanding of Scottish concerns. `` There's a general feeling of Scottish interests being neglected by the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> government,'' <PERSON> Kellas </PERSON> said. Another reason is a new property tax that has provoked widespread hostility in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The poll tax, or community charge, will be calculated per head instead of on size of property, and is central to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s crusade against left-wing local authorities who tax the well-off to finance welfare programs for the needy An opinion poll on election night found 21 percent saying the poll tax was the most important issue, compared with 19 percent who cited unemployment. The <ORGANIZATION> SNP </ORGANIZATION> seized the opportunity. Where Labor opted for legal, low-key opposition to the poll tax, the nationalists promised to organize a non-payment campaign. Thus, says <PERSON> Kellas </PERSON>, `` the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> appears powerless and does n't make enough impact. They're seen as playing the game according to the rules, through peaceful opposition within the confines of Parliament.'' He says there's no telling whether the <ORGANIZATION> SNP </ORGANIZATION> will capitalize on its triumph. Unlike in 1973, this time no general election is due for up to four years, and the afterglow of <PERSON> Govan </PERSON> may not last that long. But at the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> SNP </ORGANIZATION> believes it has found a winning formula _ `` independence within <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' That means an independent <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> living alongside <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and united with it through membership in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are talking about freeing <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> within the context of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, where <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> would be no more than a friendly partner and there would be no control of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> whatsoever,'' says <PERSON> Sillars </PERSON>. With the approach of 1992 and an end to tax barriers and frontier restrictions within the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, that notion `` is looking more palatable to people than in the past,'' said <PERSON> Kellas </PERSON>. Scottish social commentator <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Nairn </PERSON> said Scots who in the past would shy away from outright secession see the new formula as a way of retaining an association with <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> while going independent. `` The formula is appealing,'' he said, `` because it smacks of having your cake and eating it.''

 Two teen-agers already charged in incidents of molesting young boys were charged Tuesday with an additional 302 counts of sodomy and sexual abuse, authorities said. The new charges bring to 20 the number of boys allegedly abused at a home computer school in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neck </LOCATION> operated by <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, 56. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, 19, and his friend, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, 18, pleaded innocent to the new charges Tuesday before <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge Abbey Boklan. <PERSON> Boklan </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> continued free on $ 100,000 bail despite the objections of <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Onorato </PERSON>, who urged bail of $ 200,000. He argued the additional charges against <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, which bring the total to 250 counts, increase the risk that he will flee. <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> was released on $ 25,000 bail. The latest indictment alleges that <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> sexually abused seven boys, ages 9 to 12, at the Friedman residence in 1986 and 1987. The boys were students at the computer school. This latest indictment charges <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> with 198 counts of sodomy, sexual abuse, use of a child in a sexual performance and endangering the welfare of a child. <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> had previously been arrested and charged with various sex-abuse charges in connection with purported child sex orgies at the Friedman residence in 1986 and 1987. Tuesday's indictment accuses <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> of 118 counts of sex-related crimes. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>'s father pleaded guilty last March to 42 sex-related charges involving 13 boys who attended his home computer courses. He is serving 10 to 30 years in prison. The sentence is concurrent with a federal sentence that <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> received for sending child pornography through the mails. <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> are scheduled for trial Jan. 4.

 Jubilant Palestinian youths set off fireworks and chanted `` My Homeland, My Homeland'' Tuesday despite tight security measures aimed at quelling fanfare over the newly declared Palestinian independence. The celebrations in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> took on a cat-and-mouse style, as youths violated curfews to send balloons aloft with outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags or sing patriotic songs, then ran and hid when army patrols arrived, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said. At least seven people suffered gunshot wounds in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, where 650,000 Arab residents were under orders to stay in their homes, hospital officials said. Military spokesmen had no reports of bullet wounds. The army sealed the territories, setting up checkpoints on major highways and barring Palestinians from entering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Reporters were allowed into the territories only with military escorts. A reporter escorted into <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> was told by a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> woman who gave only her first name, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON>: `` Today we are very happy because the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> says we have an independent state. No matter that we do not celebrate today. We will celebrate tomorrow or the next day.'' The declaration of independence was announced early Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile, in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. Curfews were in force throughout <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and in at least 25 towns and refugee camps in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the army reported. Soldiers patrolled communities in jeeps and on foot. Armored personnel carriers mounted with machine guns drove through the streets of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, and metal-plated gravel throwers used in riot control were seen in downtown <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. In Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, 1,000 additional police and army troops were brought in. An army officer who insisted on anonymity said troop strength in some areas north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> had been increased three-fold. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has occupied the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, home to 1.5 million Palestinians, since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. For the past 11 months, the army has been battling an uprising against Israeli rule. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declaration issued Tuesday in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> was `` double talk'' that did not clearly recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or renounce terrorism. `` We still see the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a terror organization,'' said ministry spokesman <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declaration: `` This is another step in the war of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> terror organizations against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s existence and independence.'' Some Palestinian leaders welcomed the declaration. `` It shows the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> are ready to co-exist with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, that they want a state side-by-side with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Fayez </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahme </PERSON>, a moderate among <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporters. But fundamentalist Moslem leaders opposed the move. `` We have been offering sacrifices for many years, and now they recognize the state of the Jews,'' complained <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Teir </PERSON>, a Moslem religious leader associated with the <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Zeal -RRB- movement. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, hundreds of small colored balloons, each bearing a tiny <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag, were released over the Shati refugee camp and the city's <LOCATION> Remal </LOCATION> neighborhood, witnesses said. Soldiers fired tear gas, they said. Tear gas also was used to disperse 50 youths who marched through downtown banging on kitchen pots, dancing and shouting `` <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> No!'' When the soldiers went away, the partying resumed, the witnesses said. In <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, which was put under curfew for the first time since 1967, the night sky was lighted with firecrackers launched by bands of youths. At the nearby Dheishe refugee camp, passing cars of Jewish settlers were stoned. <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, was under curfew and streets were deserted. Still, the voices of children could be heard as they played on rooftops, and chanting of the Palestinian anthem `` My Homeland, My Homeland'' could be heard through windows. Arabs who live in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> staged a one-day strike to protest recent demolitions of houses in an action aimed to coincide with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declaration. A man in an army uniform and driving an army truck fired an Uzi submachine gun at reporters covering the strike in the Israeli town of <LOCATION> Taibe </LOCATION>, but no one was hurt. Police took the man away.

<HEAD>Former Police Officer Opens Fire On Blacks, Kills Three</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former police officer belonging to a neo-Nazi group opened fire on a group of blacks Tuesday in downtown <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, killing three and wounding 10 before he was arrested, police said. The white gunman was identified as <PERSON> Barend </PERSON> <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON>, 23, who resigned from the police force in February after an inquiry found him guilty of improper behavior, including `` possession of radical right-wing documents,'' police said. <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON>, dressed in a police camouflage jacket and armed with a pistol, opened fire on a group of black street vendors, witnesses said. As panicked pedestrians fled, the gunman ran along a sidewalk and opened fire a second time before police arrested him near the State Theater in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The rampage left one man and two women dead and at least 10 other people wounded, police said. All the victims were black. <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON> is a member of the neo-Nazi <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, said Minister of Law and Order <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>. The gunman claimed to be the leader of a right-wing faction called the White Wolves, he said. In a related development, a man claiming to be the leader of the White Wolves called the Afrikaans-language newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Beeld </ORGANIZATION> on Monday night and threatened to kill President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> if he released jailed black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> spoke Monday night in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, but made no mention of <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION>, the head of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. There has been widespread speculation that the government was planning to release <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, who has been in prison 26 years. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Plessis </PERSON>, a reporter with <ORGANIZATION> Beeld </ORGANIZATION>, said an Afrikaans-speaking man claiming to be the leader of the White Wolves called him at his office Monday night. The caller said he `` would have shot Mr. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> dead had he announced Mr. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release,'' du <PERSON> Plessis </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The caller said `` something'' would happen Tuesday to prove the seriousness of the White Wolves, du <PERSON> Plessis </PERSON> said. Police were investigating whether the caller was connected to the attack in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>.

 Methods of quelling civil disturbances such as tear gas and clubs are more dangerous than the public perceives and can be lethal, physicians said Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting. `` The problem we have is that in government and police and military actions there are a variety of so-called non-lethal weapons that are used,'' said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fine </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's little public appreciation that some of these devices and weapons are in fact lethal.'' Fine said police and military forces using such things as tear gas or guns loaded with rubber bullets should be made aware of their potential danger. `` It really is important for police and military personnel to get a better understanding for the medical consequences so that they be used with more caution, more restraint, and in some cases be totally banned,'' he said. `` Tear gas is a misnomer, if ever there was one. It's actually poison gas,'' Fine said. Effects of tear gas were documented from observations of the effects of tear gas used to control student demonstrators in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in June 1987, Fine said. While the common symptoms of crying, coughing and nausea subside within a few hours, people living near areas frequently gassed reported getting `` tear gas cold,'' a persistent cough and sore throat for several weeks, he said. While police and government officials say crowd control methods are vital to maintaining public security, <PERSON> Fine </PERSON> said the Physicians for Human Rights believe the instruments used should be carefully examined and their use should be limited. Other health care professionals at the seminar reported results of a February trip to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> observing casualties on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Leaning </PERSON>, director of emergency services for the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plan </ORGANIZATION>, said that of 103 injured people interviewed, 72 percent had been injured within 24 hours of the interview. While gunshot wounds accounted for 5 percent of the recently injured, the remainder were due to rubber bullets, tear gas and clubs, she said. Many of the beating wounds were broken bones in the arm or hand. Leaning said the Israeli government cooperated with the physicians' visit, but the team had difficulty interviewing injured <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and spoke mainly with Palestinians. After the team reported its findings, the Israeli government responded mainly by pointing to an improved infant mortality rate on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Velvl </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, a professor of epidemiology at <ORGANIZATION> Ben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gurion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in Beer Sheva, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, said the reports of injuries suffered by Palestinians on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> were biased because they did n't take into account injuries inflicted by Palestinians. `` They're not demonstrations, they're attacks,'' he said.

<HEAD>Israel Rejects PLO Declaration as `Double Talk'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rejected the Palestinian declaration of independence Tuesday as an exercise in `` ambiguity and double talk'' that neither renounces terrorism nor clearly recognizes the Jewish state. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was put on the defensive by the move toward moderation, however, and officials concede they face an uphill battle against the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> attempt to win recognition for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, acting as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> legislature, proclaimed the Palestinian state and issued a political declaration accepting <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 242, which implicity recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. The declaration also limits <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla action to military targets in the occupied territories. Only leftist groups in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> praised the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> for moderating its anti-Israeli language. Extreme right-wing groups urged the government to respond by annexing part or all of the occupied lands and establish new Jewish settlements. About 1.5 million Palestinians and 70,000 Jewish settlers live in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 war. The Foreign Ministry, which issued the Israeli government's official reaction, said of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declaration: `` Ambiguity and double talk are again employed to excuse its advocacy of violence, resorting to terrorism and adherence to extreme positions. Ministry spokesman <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said: `` They mentioned rejection of terrorism outside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but they did not denounce terrorism inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. So we still see the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a terror organization, and the government decision not to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> stands.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who is expected to lead a new right-wing government, contended that moderating the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> language was merely a tactic, part of an overall strategy to destroy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He said the declaration was `` another step in the war of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> terror organizations against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s existence and independence and we shall respond accordingly.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, met with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and described him as `` very concerned that world public opinion will be taken in by syrupy words in a great, vast hoax.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, leader of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s rival, said there could be no Palestinian state without negotiations involving <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declaration was `` yet another attempt to avoid making unequivocal decisions.'' <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sela </PERSON>, an international relations expert at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` It will be seen by Israelis as too little and not convincing enough. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> needs to do something striking with a clear intention,'' Leil of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said: `` We realize we will have to work very hard in order to explain our position in the world.'' Analysts said the main problem for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is its lack of a credible plan for starting peace negotiations and ending Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories that began nearly a year ago. <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Susser </PERSON>, a political scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> declaration may cause the world to look more favorably on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s position does seem to be rather inflexible as opposed to what seems to be a softening of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s position,'' he said in an interview. Trade Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, a leading member of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, called the declaration a `` dangerous development. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> might face economic sanctions and political isolation, and should assert its own claim by imposing sovereignty on part of the occupied lands. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON>, a parliament member, was among leftists who welcomed the more moderate PLO language. He praised Palestinian acceptance of a 1947 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> partition resolution that envisioned both Jewish and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states. `` Adoption of the partition principle by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, indirect recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and readiness for negotiations shows the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has changed,'' he said. <PERSON> Susser </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> wording of the declaration suggested the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> viewed acceptance of a two-state solution only as a `` necessary evil.'' `` It's clearly an effort to have your cake and eat it too,'' he said. `` That's what the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has been doing for years.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has inspected and cleared more than two-thirds of its B-1B bombers following a crash last week that destroyed one of the long-range planes in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, officials said Tuesday. Lt.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the presidential election by solidifying his support with Republicans and successfully convincing disaffected voters to back him, according to a post-election survey released Tuesday. The poll, conducted by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, also said 44 percent of the respondents thought the federal budget deficit should be the top priority for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. Other crucial issues for voters are protecting American jobs and increasing programs for families and children. The telephone poll, one of several done for the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-based </LOCATION> news company in 1988, measured responses from 2,022 registered voters. The margin of error was three percentage points. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who defeated Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by 54 percent to 46 percent on Nov. 8, did not entirely recreate the coalition that gave President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a resounding victory in 1984, the poll found. But by the second week in September, the vice president had put together various elements that gave him a victory in November, the survey indicated. `` While our surveys showed a fair degree of offsetting change within Democratic groups between September and October, the overall patterns of support first identified in September persisted through Election Day,'' the pollsters said in a statement that accompanied the results. Among the trends reflected in the poll are that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: _ Bolstered support among core Republican groups between May and late October _ Increased support among young, moderate voters during the same period _ Seized the backing of disaffected voters, those lower-middle-income people who feel alienated and tend to be disgruntled `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could not have won with the disaffecteds,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON>, Gallup's president. That group is estimated to comprise about 10 percent of the voting pool. In May, shortly after the end of the primary season, the disaffecteds were evenly divided between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. By September, their opinions of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had moved from lukewarm to highly critical. Ultimately, 68 percent said they voted for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the survey found. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Traugott </PERSON>, a Gallup analyst, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attracted the disaffecteds by stressing his tough crime theme and pinning the liberal label on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In fact, the success of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign was based on highlighting the controversies over liberalism, the Pledge of Allegiance and the prison furlough program. Among <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> voters, the most important campaign issues were the allegations about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s involvement in the Iran-Contra matter, the administration's dealing with <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and the selection of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate. Voters expressed some discontent with the campaign and the candidates, the survey said. Some 63 percent who backed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said they were dissatisfied with the candidates, while 16 percent of those who voted for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed dissatisfaction. Respondents also were asked to rate others participants in the political election. The news media and campaign consultants were given the lowest marks on an A through F rating system. One in six people gave the press a failing grade. <PERSON> Traugott </PERSON> said he thought the low grade given the press reflected in part a lack of understanding of how reporters do their work. Other surveys have shown, for instance, that the media as an institution is evaluated highly.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial production rose a moderately strong 0.4 percent in October, the best increase in three months, despite a decline in activity in the nation's oil fields, the government said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said its industrial production index last month rose to a seasonally adjusted 139.2 percent of its 1977 base, reflecting increases in production of business equipment and automobiles. `` We're not talking anything dramatic here, but it's a comfortable gain,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Noting that retail sales for the month also increased, <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> said, `` We're seeing strength in both the production side -LRB- of the economy -RRB- and the demand side, which suggests that strength on the production side can continue.'' The October gain in production at factories, mines and utilities was in line with economists' expectations. It followed smaller increases of 0.2 percent in September, revised up from an earlier estimate of no change, and 0.3 percent in August. Production jumped 1.1 percent in July. The index has not declined since September 1987, a reflection of the strength in the manufacturing sector. A drop in the value of the dollar has triggered a surge in sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods overseas this year and a related boom in spending to expand and modernize factories. However, economists have become worried that manufacturing may be growing too strongly, straining production capacity and leading to inflation. The relatively weak industrial production of August and September had calmed those fears somewhat, but signs of a rebound in October have rekindled the concern. `` What is needed is really rather subdued growth ... and that's not what we're getting,'' <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> said Production in the manufacturing sector rose 0.5 percent in October, following a 0.4 percent gain in September. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 7.6 million units, up from 7.4 million units a month earlier and 7.0 million units in August. Production of business equipment jumped 0.8 percent for the second month in a row and stood 9.4 percent higher than a year ago. Within that category, production of manufacturing equipment rose 1.8 percent last month and 1.9 percent in September. Output at mines, which includes oil and gas drilling, fell 0.9 percent in October, the third consecutive decline. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm, said falling world oil prices have curtailed drilling in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Over the last couple of weeks drilling activity has dropped off sharply. You're going to see that continue,'' he said. Production at utilities rose 0.4 percent last month, following a large drop of 3.8 percent in September, which was attributed to the decline in electricity use for air conditioners following the summer heat wave. Total output at factories, mines and utilities was 5.1 percent higher than a year ago.

 U.S.-Soviet arms talks aimed at slashing long-range nuclear arsenals adjourned Tuesday until next year after a four-month session, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators said major disagreements remain. The chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy, <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON>, said an 11th round of talks, hoped to `` move the process forward,'' will begin early next year after President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> assumes office Jan. 20. `` We are hoping for new progress'' under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s chief delegate <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Obukhov </PERSON> said before a final full meeting of both delegations at the Soviet diplomatic mission. <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> said he assured the Soviet delegation of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s commitment to the talks and said the president-elect would maintain `` continuity'' in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position `` We continue to move forward and are encouraged by that movement,'' <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> said after the session. But he added: `` Major disagreements remain. We understand each other better and we understand the issues better.'' `` It is just beginning. It will continue,'' he said of the superpowers' effort to reduce their giant atomic arsenals. The latest round of talks began July 12. Two areas are involved: the draft Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty aimed at cutting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet long-range nuclear forces by half, and defense and space. The talks began in March 1985 and have produced the U.S.-Soviet agreement to scrap all intermediate-range missiles. `` We have significantly reduced both areas where positions are starkly contrasting,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Read </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanmer </PERSON> said of the latest round. He said differences were narrowed on air-launched cruise missiles, where agreed counting rules are being sought, and on monitoring mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles if they are included in the treaty. A long-standing disagreement remains over the range an air-launched cruise missile must have to be included in the treaty, <PERSON> Hanmer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> indicated no progress was made on sea-launched cruise missiles, which <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> wants to limit under the pact. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has resisted including them, saying they can not be reliably monitored. <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> also said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative, the program for a space-based missile defense opposed by the Soviets, remains a `` serious'' objective and is not a bargaining chip at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The program, popularly called `` Star Wars,'' has been a stumbling block since negotiations began. <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> said he was not aware of plans for Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s fifth and final meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say has been set for next month in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The summit would give the two sides another chance to narrow the gap on START. The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> round formally ends Wednesday with a ceremony in which the two sides will exchange copies of the START treaty draft. <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON>, 68, said it was too early to talk about whether he will remain chief negotiator in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned to the nation's capital today after four days of sun and surf in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and held his first meeting as president-elect with a foreign head of government, West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also asked Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> today to remain in his current post in the new administration. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is a former investment banker who served briefly as an appointed member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He is a longtime friend of the president-elect, and was a key member of a circle of advisers that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leaned on during his successful presidential campaign. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> greeted <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> outside the vice president's residence at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> after the German's leader's lunch with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Asked by reporters if he would give <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> reassurances on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` the chancellor knows how strongly I feel about doing something about that deficit.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> agreed in German. Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was also on hand to greet <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and two of his Cabinet members, West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters who asked what he hoped for from the meeting, `` Maybe I can get a little advice.'' He returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> earlier in the day after a four-day vacation in <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stream </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` Off to work,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said as he departed on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two from Palm Beach International Airport. After landing at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he was flown by helicopter to his residence. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to meet Wednesday with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. The White House announced today that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would meet with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> next month when he visits the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. On the eve of his departure for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was joined at a beachfront vacation home for dinner by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, a top campaign adviser mentioned as a candidate for White House chief of staff. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> laughingly told reporters not to `` read too much into'' the visit by <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, who was the only political associate to see <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on vacation and who flew back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Asked by reporters about his prospects for the chief of staff job, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said, `` I'm still governor.'' Pressed further, he said, `` I'll do whatever he needs.'' He said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` discussed things in general. ... He will talk specifics in about a week or so.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in a beachfront question-and-answer session that his meetings with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> would focus on `` talking about where we go after I become president, but it should be viewed as a continuation of existing policy.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also sought to reassure a nervous international financial community that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit will be a top priority at the start of his administration. `` It is a matter of great urgency ... and I want to be in the forefront of trying to do something about it after I become president,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign promise to reject any tax increases has led some analysts to question whether he is serious about reducing the deficit. He was been dogged by reports of a declining dollar abroad and a dramatic drop in the Dow Jones industrial average after his election. The calming statements had an impact on financial trading Monday and today, however, as the dollar rebounded on most international financial markets after its downward spiral last week. Several traders credited the statements with calming fears that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s advisers want the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency to fall further The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which took an election-week loss of nearly 80 points last weeks, fell 1.95 on Monday to record its fourth consecutive losing session. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the incoming chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said tax increases will be needed next year to make legally required cuts in the deficit. `` Anybody who's dealt with budget issues knows the size of the challenge is too large to exempt any areas,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, however, dismissed the financial unrest by saying, `` These gyrations happen. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he will tackle the deficit `` early on in my presidency'' but added, `` I do not want to start acting like I am president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> yet.'' He was expected to name former Deputy Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> as budget director and <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> as White House economics adviser. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides said that a list of three to five names is being drawn up for him to consider for each Cabinet post. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also was asked about a report suggesting that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, his choice as secretary of state, would wield clout as a `` deputy president.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` You have n't heard that here.'' On reports that a three-person chief-of-staff arrangement was under consideration, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Stay tuned. I'll have announcements on that pretty soon.'' On other topics: _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sidestepped a question about whether he would name a woman to his Cabinet, coining a new word in the process `` I will anticipate there will be female representation in the Cabinet, but ... I do n't like to put it like that sounds kind of quotaistic.'' _ He rejected allegations that government foreclosure warnings to 80,000 farmers were held up until after the election. `` I do n't believe there's any political motivation related to agricultural policies at all,'' he said.

Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said she will start packing for the move when they return from their Thanksgiving holiday in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. She said first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> already has moved the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> furniture out of the White House residence and found replacements for the pieces they took.

 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> must begin providing autistic children with the special education and attention their handicap demands, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee said in a report approved Tuesday. The House Select Committee to Study Autism voted unanimously to accept a draft report that outlines ways the state can help autistic children. There are about 15,000 autistic adults and children in the state, <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markosek </PERSON> estimated. The 32-page report will be put into bill form for introduction during next year's legislative session, <PERSON> Markosek </PERSON> said. The current legislative session ends Nov. 30. As defined in the report, autism is a mental disorder that is a `` severely incapacitating, lifelong developmental disability'' that usually appears from birth to age 3. Autistic children suffer from poor social relationships, impaired communication, and persistent repetitive and restrictive behavior, the report said. The state's failure to recognize autism as an illness different from other mental disorders results in autistic children being placed in educational courses that do not meet their needs, <PERSON> Markosek </PERSON> said. `` Since there are no formal categories, the children are placed in the category of being mentally retarded,'' he said, adding that `` a lot of times they get training that is inappropriate for them.'' <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Husic </PERSON>, a lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retarded </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, said because autism is not recognized as a separate disorder, autistic children are `` falling between the cracks.'' The report recommends developing in-service training programs on autism for professionals who deal with handicapped children, educating parents on ways to help their autistic children at home, and implementing programs to help the autistic move into regular classrooms, vocational training programs or the community. Also included in the report is a long-range recommendation that the state set up two regional centers for helping autistic children.

 A minister is suggesting that various congregations could save money and reduce waste by joining forces to build a high-rise church, with one floor for each denomination and shared meeting areas. The Rev. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevin </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of the Ascension in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, says such partner congregations could sell their land and put the money into a trust fund to help the needy. <PERSON> Nevin </PERSON>, 55, does n't propose all churches move in this direction. But he estimated that six churches within four miles of his church use their sanctuaries no more than 20 hours a week, and said the issue of under-used or wasted space needs to be considered. `` It is simply outrageous _ not to say un-Christian and a betrayal of the gospel _ that in those places where unfortunate people are most to be found, empty buildings and rarely used buildings are owned by people who call themselves by the name of <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, who himself had nowhere to lay his head,'' <PERSON> Nevin </PERSON> said. However, he said, `` Whenever I've shared it with other clergy, they've said, ` Yes, it is interesting, but it will never happen.' They just shrug it off.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cora </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Delmarva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecumenical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, who has worked as a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest in a shared church building in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said that sharing a building `` does promote ecumenism to some extent.'' `` It does n't solve all the problems, in the sense that people still want to be organized in groups small enough so they can know each other,'' <PERSON> Cora </PERSON> said. The Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, said he hoped the proposal would be seriously explored. `` Part of me says it's important for historical reasons to maintain my church, but ... I would probably agree to it a little bit reluctantly to serve the greater good ...,'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> said. `` The most attractive part of it is you'd be able to spend more money on missions and not just on taking care of church property,'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Some Serious Heart Problems Can Be Pain-Free, Doctors Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Studies of `` silent'' episodes of cardiac distress show that an absence of pain does not mean an absence of heart problems, scientists reported Tuesday at a meeting of the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The temporary reduction of blood flow to the heart, a condition called ischemia, can occur with no symptoms and no pain, an thus are `` silent.'' Yet, doctors said at news conference, these episodes indicate that a patient may be in real danger of serious heart disease or even fatal heart attack. Dr. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepine </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> said many cardiologists now recognize that silent ischemia can strike time after time and never leave a trace of pain or discomfort to signal that there is a problem. `` It can occur in subjects who have never had a symptom of heart disease,'' he said, yet new techniques of measuring heart activity have determined that silent ischemia occurs often, and can last for hours. Usually a reduced flow of blood to the heart will cause chest pain. Severe pains are called angina pectoris and usually quickly send patients to the doctor. Vessels narrowed by disease, spasms or blood clots can all block or impede blood flow to the heart. If it's serious enough, the result is a major heart attack and much pain. But even <PERSON> Pepine </PERSON> said doctors now realize that even when there is no pain, the heart may be under seige. Dr. <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION> said tests using ambulatory electrocardigams, which record activity of the heart for 24 continuous hours, are able to detect episodes not felt by the patient. Such patients, he said, can be `` at very much higher risk of subsequent heart attack'' and should be treated more aggressively than their pain symptoms would indicate. Among patients being treated for heart attack and doing well, said <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON>, the indications of silent attack `` is a very potent marker for those who are at high risk for mortalilty in the subsequent year.'' <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said it would be impractical to test everyone for these silent attacks, but he said his experiences suggest it would be reasonable to test people, such as middle-aged men, who have a number of other risk factors, such as a family history of heart disease, cigarette smoking or high cholesterol readings. Treadmill stress tests, he said, have been very successful in finding silent, pain-free heart disease that might otherwise have not been detected. In these tests, subjects are attached to sensors that monitor heart function while they walk on a treadmill. `` Even in an individual who is not having pain, poor performance on a treadmill can identify those relatively well individuals who are at high risk for a coronary event,'' <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said. He said he recently tested a middle-aged firefighter who was totally pain free and had never been diagnosed with a heart condition. Within 2 -LCB- minutes on the treadmill, <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said, the sensors detected a severely stressed heart. Later tests using X rays showed that one major cardiac artery was completely blocked and another had only 10 percent flow. `` He was a walking time bomb,'' <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said. `` Yet, he played tennis, felt well and said he never had any pain.'' <PERSON> Pepine </PERSON> said studies have proven that the silent attacks occur often, and that they are predictive of more serious heart problems. But studies have yet to demonstrate that treating patients with silent ischemia can extend their lives. He said such studies are now under way. Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> said that though tests have proven that these silent attacks occur, scientists still do n't know why some patients feel no pain. `` People's pain thresholds are different,'' he said. `` It might be that people with high thresholds might be more apt to have these silent episodes.''

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today named Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a longtime friend, to remain in his current post in the new administration. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his appointee for the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> understands the need to keep inflation low and `` knows that we must resist the policies that will impede that effort such as raising taxes or resorting to protection.'' Added the president-elect, `` He knows we've got to sit down with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a deficit reduction agreement and we've got to do it soon.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, fresh from a long weekend of relaxation in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> sunshine, appeared with <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> outside the vice president's official residence. For his part, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said he would `` do my best to help the president-elect, serve the people and to build on this, the longest recovery in the history of the country.'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said he had no comment on the dollar, which has fallen in recent days. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would make no other appointments during the day. He said he felt no pressure to name a new chief of staff but added he might do so `` fairly soon.'' The president-elect dined alone Monday night with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, believed to be a leading candidate for the top staff job in the new White House. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> walked off <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two just behind the Bushes when they arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> earlier in the day. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s appointment marked the second time that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has turned to a longtime confidante to fill a key post in his administration. Secretary of State-designate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first Cabinet appointment, announced the morning after his election last week. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> described <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a former chairman of the investment banking house of <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, as a man who `` brings to his office an extraordinary knowledge of financial markets, experience in the private sector'' and said he was `` very well respected both here and abroad.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced the appointment of <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> after meeting privately with visiting West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, 58, served briefly as an appointed member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. He is a longtime friend of the president-elect, and was a key member of a circle of advisers that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leaned on during his successful presidential campaign. The appointment came as no surprise. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> to his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post last summer, and it was long expected that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would keep his old friend in the Cabinet if he won the presidential election. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the appointment in an uncertain international economic atmosphere. The value of the dollar fell sharply last week, dragging down stock prices as well because of investor fears over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s economic policies To calm jitters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> both acted in recent days to reassure investors that the new administration had no secret plan to drive down the value of the dollar.

 Background on the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and the land they occupy:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 HISTORY _ Under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> partition plan of 1947 the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> was to have been the nucleus of an independent Palestinian state, but in the 1948 war <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured some of the area allotted to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> annexed the rest. In 1967, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s share of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and took the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE LANDS _ The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> is two bulges of land on the west side of the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> between them, totaling 2,323 square miles. The <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> is a coastal slip of land that covers 141 square miles.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE PEOPLE _ About 850,000 Palestinians live in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, including 400,000 refugees whose families fled the territory that became <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1948. Since Israeli occupation began in 1967, 62,000 Jewish settlers have established more than 100 settlements on land expropriated by the government. More than two-thirds of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s 650,000 Palestinian residents are refugees crowded into eight <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> camps, many living in single-room shacks built from scraps of wood and corrugated iron About 8,000 Jewish settlers also live in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, calling each other `` Dear Ron'' and `` Helmut,'' bade their farewells on the sunlit South Lawn of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday after six years of close alliance on the world stage. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reaffirmed `` the strong American commitment to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'' and said, `` That divided city ... remains a powerful symbol of a divided <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and a litmus test of East-West relations.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> thanked the American president for his `` bold and resolute commitment to improving East-West relations'' and said, `` Any kind of worsening of the situation between East and West will by felt like an earthquake in our country ... and, of course, first of all in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>.'' It was an unseasonally balmy day, and even warmer weather is forecast for Wednesday, when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> holds a similar meeting with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. Neither <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> broke any new ground in their meeting or the formal departure statements that followed it. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that the two countries `` continue to seek ways to share early the risks, burdens and responsibilities, as well as the benfits, of our common defense.'' `` We reviewed the difficulties each country faces in doing more, but pledge we would each do our fair share,'' the president said. He congratulated <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on the decision of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> member states to take steps toward closer economic integration by the end of 1992 and expressed `` our concern that this be done in a manner that promotes fair trade internationally.'' They devoted much of their closing statements, however, to reminiscence and farewell. `` Helmut, this marks my last meeting as president with you,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Six years ago, we stood together as I announced the formation of a presidential commission to commemorate the tricentennial of the first German settlement in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Six years to the day, I'm proud to announce a product of that commission _ the dedication of a garden, here in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, as a symbol of the friendship between our two countries.'' `` In a few months, I ` ll be leaving the White House,'' he said. `` But, the garden _ and all it represents _ will remain, to be nurtured and sustained by the friendship between Germans and Americans and by the leadership that you have provided.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, speaking through an interpreter, told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, `` I believe we can say, Mr. President, <PERSON> Dear </PERSON> <PERSON> Ron </PERSON>, we can put it very briefly and say these have been good years. I think that both of us have paved the way for development which will be pursued by your successor in office. ... God bless you in all you do.''

<TEXT>
 A convicted <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union `` ghost'' employee testified Tuesday that <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> set up a $ 110,000 embezzlement scheme to pay people who did no work for the union. Federal prosecutors have said <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, who at the time of his death July 9 faced embezzlement and labor racketeering charges, masterminded a scheme to issue $ 700,000 worth of union paychecks to such people, a form of embezzlement known as ghosting. Two other Local 507 officials now are on trial in the alleged scheme. <PERSON> John </PERSON> A. `` Jack'' <PERSON> Nardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a prison inmate and a federally protected witness, testified he received paychecks of at least $ 300 a week from Local 507 in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> from late 1971 through 1978, while never reporting for work. Federal labor laws require union leaders to use dues from union members for the benefit of those members. <PERSON> Nardi </PERSON>, son of the late <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nardi </PERSON>, last April struck a plea bargain and and entered a guilty plea to embezzling Local 507 funds and also arranging to accept a bribe from <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> to cover up the embezzlement. Sentencing was deferred until after the present trial. He is in prison on a state grand theft conviction. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> was secretary-treasurer at Local 507 and president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> from 1983 until his death from cancer. <PERSON> Nardi </PERSON> testified that his father told him in late 1971 that an arrangement had been made for him to work for <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nardi </PERSON> said that in a meeting with <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, his role was never clarified, but that his starting pay was set at $ 300 a week, and his checks starting coming every week in the mail. <PERSON> Nardi </PERSON> said he never worked even one day for Local 507. He said <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, Local 507 president, signed his checks. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nardi </PERSON>, who was secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 410 and a reputed organized crime figure, was killed in a car bomb blast in 1977. <PERSON> Nardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> testified that at his father's funeral, <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> reassurred him his pay would continue. He said the paychecks stopped after 1978, when, he said, <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> told him about concerns he had with a possible federal investigation into the payments. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, 66, is still president of Local 507 and is one of the nation's most powerful Teamsters officials. He has been a <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> international vice president since 1983 and also is president of <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> 41 in northeast <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>. He is charged with two counts of labor racketeering, two of embezzlement of union funds and two of making false statements to the Department of Labor. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, 52, recording secretary at <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 507 </ORGANIZATION> and a business agent at <ORGANIZATION> Bakery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 19, is charged with two counts of labor racketeering and one count of embezzlement. Pretrial documents indicated that <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s defense in the `` ghost employee'' allegation would have been that he was authorized by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to hire certain people onto the union's payroll in order to preserve his secret status as an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informant. The so-called `` ghosts'' were described as being able to provide information largely about organized crime activity.

<HEAD>Doctors Weigh Whether To Separate Siamese Twins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A doctor who delivered Siamese twins said his first indication of the unusual birth was the sight of three arms emerging from the incision he made for a Caesarean section. `` On the fetal monitor, there was only one heartbeat and it was perfect. The baby appeared to be of normal size. There was no fetal distress,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, the obstetrician-gynecologist who delivered the twins Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Frederick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Shortly after birth they were brought to <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. `` We were expecting one baby, not two babies joined together at the chest and upper abdomen,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said. When <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> made the incision, `` Three arms came out and I knew definitely that something was going on,'' he said. `` I also knew the first incision would not work. The baby was trapped. I was afraid we might damage the baby.'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said he quickly made another incision. `` We could see the baby was not in good shape _ its color was poor, it was lethargic and not breathing well,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said. `` Then, I had a very big, astonishing surprise. We did n't have one baby. We had two that were conjoined. After I calmed down, I did my surgery.'' Siamese twins, which result when a fertilized egg fails to divide completely, occur once every 50,000 to 100,000 live births. About half of such twins die within 48 hours of birth. The parents, who live in <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> and have one other child, have asked that their names and details of the twins be withheld, including their sex and whether dcotors will try to separate them. `` I think the parents are still in shock,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrop </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. `` It will be a couple of days before our physicians can say whether we can do anything for the babies.'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said he did not perform a sonogram, or ultrasound test, which can detect multiple pregnancies, physical abnormalities and determine fetal age, because the mother did not want one. In March 1982, Siamese twins joined from the chest to the abdomen were successfully separated in a 10-hour operation at <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. And 14 months ago, <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> made medical history when <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> of Ulm, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, became the first Siamese twins ever to survive separation at the head.

 A damp breeze made for poor putting weather Tuesday, but Soviet officials touring a golf course similar to one being built in their country said it made them feel right at home. `` This is the <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> visiting the greens,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, architect of both the SentryWorld 18-hole course here and the course just outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The Soviets signed an agreement with <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> last June during the summit between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The five Soviet officials touring the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> course laughed as they rode in golf carts for the first time and tried their hand at putting a few balls. Then they studied both how the course is managed and the machinery used to groom it. `` Too many machines and cars is needed for decoration of the golf course,'' said <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Maltsev </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Techno </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION>, as he toured the maintenance building where Sentry Insurance keeps about 100 pieces of machinery. The Soviets came to northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> to see the par-72 golf course because it was built despite some of the same problems the site 35 kilometers west of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> faces, said <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergeev </PERSON> of the administration for services for the diplomatic corps. Like northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> site is relatively flat and forested and the trees must be removed and lakes built, he said. `` The climate in the area of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is almost exactly what it is here,'' <PERSON> Sergeev </PERSON> said through an interpreter. The Soviet course, expected to open in 1991, will be the country's first championship course and will be open six months a year, he said. `` In the winter, it will not be open because it will be lying under a lot of snow,'' <PERSON> Sergeev </PERSON> said. The Soviet course will provide an opportunity for visitors and diplomats to play golf in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, he said. But <PERSON> Sergeev </PERSON> said he hoped the Soviet course `` will be a place to rest and not to do business on the golf course'' as is often done in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The quality of rest is a matter of opinion. The Soviet course will not have golf carts. `` That's an American way. The Russian way, we walk,'' he said.

<HEAD>Researcher Modifies Bacteria to Protect Crops From Frost</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Potato seedlings treated with a genetically modified bacteria designed to protect plants from frost damage suffered one-third as much damage as unprotected plants, a researcher reported Tuesday. Two years of small-scale field tests proved the procedure to be safe and effective, according to <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindow </PERSON>, associate professor of plant pathology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>'s College of Natural Resources <PERSON> Lindow </PERSON> was scheduled to report his findings Tuesday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phytopathological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Similar research by other scientists has shown that genetically modified bacteria can protect strawberry plants from frost. The minor genetic modification was designed to counter the effect of common bacteria whose structure triggers frost formation on plants at temperatures just below freezing. <PERSON> Lindow </PERSON> and an associate genetically modified a strain of the bacteria so it lacked the frost-promoting gene but was otherwise unchanged. The modified bacteria was applied to potato seedlings before naturally occurring bacteria could gain hold. Monitoring showed that the modified bacteria could not be detected beyond the experiment's 93-foot buffer zone <PERSON> Lindow </PERSON>'s field tests were delayed for almost four years because of safety concerns about outdoor experiments using genetically engineered organisms. But <PERSON> Lindow </PERSON> said the genetically altered bacteria `` wo n't thrive outside of the treated area'' because other bacteria are established there. Established frost-fighting methods such as sprinklers and wind machines can be more effective but they work in a narrower temperature range and are more expensive to administer than the bacteria strategy, <PERSON> Lindow </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said Tuesday it was up to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to make the next move toward <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace now that the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> have formed an independent state that implicitly recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` The ball is now in the American court,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said a few hours after the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile, solemnly proclaimed Palestinian independence in a ceremony early Tuesday The declaration accepted <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security Council Resolution 242, which implicitly recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> when it refers to the right of all countries in the region to live within secure and recognized borders. The proclamation topped the list of issues taken up during the council's four-day special session in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, which ended Tuesday. The 450-member council also voted to form a provisional government at a future date and pledged to restrict guerrilla operations to military targets in Israeli-occupied territories. The council's move, largely symbolic and clearly aimed at capitalizing on the 11-month-old Palestinian uprising in Israeli-occupied lands, sought to remove obstacles to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Referring to the intefadeh, or uprising, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told a news conference: `` It is true that this is the intefadeh session of the -LRB- council -RRB-, but it also could be the session of peace with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief said the council had given him a mandate to pursue a political settlement. `` But if we are met with a rebuff,'' he said, `` only God knows the outcome.'' `` Let it also be clear, I can always come back to our -LRB- council -RRB- and declare that moderation does not pay,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> immediately rejected <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s declaration, calling it `` double talk'' and denying that it recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or truly renounced terrorism. `` They mentioned rejection of terrorism outside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but they did not denounce terrorism inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON>. `` So we still see the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a terror organization, and the government decision not to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> stands.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> also rejected the move, saying that the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict had to be resolved by negotiations, not a unilateral act on either side. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has demanded the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renounce terrorism before there could be any dealings. The declaration, which <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> read out at a seaside conference center west of the Algerian capital, did not specifically describe the new state's borders. But officials said it was clear the `` Palestinian territory'' referred to was the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. `` We are obviously talking about land occupied in 1967,'' said <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaath </PERSON>, head of the political committee that drafted the document. Of accepting Resolution 242, he said: `` It's a bitter pill, but we had to swallow it.'' Resolution 242 also calls on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to withdraw from territories it captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. In the past, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has refused to accept the resolution because it deals with the future of Palestinians as merely a refegee problem. Late in the afternoon, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> announced its state had been recognized by 12 countries, most Arab and Moslem <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporters. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, accompanied by other <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials, laid the cornerstone for the first embassy of the Palestinian state in a suburb of <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. The Algerian government donated the land. A member of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s political department who asked not to be named said that aside from waiting for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to act, the organization also so plans to launch another diplomatic offensive in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and elsewhere. `` We are expecting a new declaration from the European -LRB- Economic -RRB- Community,'' said the official, adding that discussions would be aimed particularly at <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> is the current president and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> steps in next in the rotating common market presidency. `` It's a new era in <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> political thinking,'' said the official. `` In the past, we talked about dreams. Now, we are talking about realities.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, warning that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s security in the next century will depend upon advanced research being performed now, said Tuesday he wanted to increase by $ 300 million the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s support of independent corporate research. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, in a speech at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said he had been reviewing <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending on `` independent research and development'' and that despite the national budget deficit, could not support cuts in such spending. `` This independent <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; D program allows corporations full flexibility in determining what research and development to conduct, while at the same time enabling the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to identify emerging technologies judged to have important defense applications,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` In 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reimbursed contractors for $ 3.6 billion of the more than $ 7 billion they spent on <ORGANIZATION> IR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; D. As a measure of this program's effectiveness, I want to announce today that I will submit a 1990 budget request to the president allotting an additional $ 300 million to underwrite independent R & amp; D.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> described the move as one of four key steps to maintaining <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s technological lead over the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in military weaponry. The other steps include maintaining effective controls against technology theft and espionage; more cooperation with Western allies who also are pushing back technological frontiers; and supporting a healthy defense industrial base of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contractors. In his speech, a copy of which was released in advance at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> expressed optimism about each of the four steps except one: the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial base. `` This, I am sorry to say, is at present a dark cloud on the strategic horizon,'' he said. `` There are unmistakable signs that right now, our defense industrial base is shrinking _ the result of a defense budgeting process and acquisition system that combine chronic instability and excessive regulation, with predictable results. `` We need to put an end to this erosion; streamline and stabilize the system, and create a more hospitable climate for technological innovation and growth.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is expected to step down in January when Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is inaugurated as president and thus the fate of his recommendation for increased research spending remains unclear. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had been widely rumored in recent months to be considering a cut in such funding and thus <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s endorsement of an actual increase might carry great weight with his successor. Earlier in his speech Tuesday, delivered before the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> at the university, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> asserted technology had made it possible for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` to meet its national security needs without militarizing society.'' `` Rather than engaging in a contest to match potential adversaries soldier for soldier, ship for ship or tank for tank, we have sought to turn our technological superiority to our strategic advantage. To a large extent, we've offset quantity with quality,'' he said.

 Families of 28 men killed in the L'Ambiance Plaza building collapse and the 16 men who were injured will share $ 30 million under a tentative $ 41 million settlement of all lawsuits, a judge said Tuesday. Legal experts said the mediation process that led to the agreement may have averted years of litigation and was unique because of the number of lawsuits and potential lawsuits involved. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zampano </PERSON> said he and a state <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge, who together mediated talks leading to the settlement, scheduled a hearing for final approval of the agreement for Dec. 1. If all parties sign, it would end all litigation from the collapse of the half-finished apartment building in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> on April 23, 1987. `` I think we have a global settlement of all aspects of the L'Ambiance building collapse and I feel very, very good,'' <PERSON> Zampano </PERSON> said. `` All 40 defendants and potential defendants contributed -LRB- to the settlement -RRB-, which speaks of extraordinary cooperation.'' `` No amount of money is going to replace what those people lost. The only good thing is that it was done speedily,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieder </PERSON>, lead counsel for the plaintiffs. The proposed settlement did n't resolve the question of who was to blame, although federal investigators placed the primary blame for the accident on three contractors. Lawyers for all sides are reviewing documents drafted to implement the settlement. Federal, state and probate judges, along with two members of the state <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Compensation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, also will be asked to approve it, <PERSON> Zampano </PERSON> said. Under the settlement, the children of the men who died will receive a weekly income until they are 30 years old and money for college if they choose to go, <PERSON> Zampano </PERSON> said. The mediators wanted them to be taken care of `` just as if their fathers had lived,'' he said. Widows will receive income from annuities until they are 62 to 65 years old, when they will be eligible for Social Security, <PERSON> Zampano </PERSON> said. Individual payments to victims and their heirs were n't released. Several legal experts commended the mediation process <PERSON> Zampano </PERSON> and state Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meadow </PERSON> organized. There were 92 attorneys involved representing victims' families and workers, 40 companies involved in the project, the city of <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> and state and federal agencies. `` It's working concurrently to wrap the whole thing up in one package that seems to me to be quite unusual and commendable,'' said J.L. <PERSON> Pottenger </PERSON>, adjunct professor of law at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` What is -LRB- unusual -RRB- is the size and scope of this case and the potential number of parties and complexity of it,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION> attorney. <PERSON> Zampano </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meadow </PERSON> determined how much each victim should receive by considering such factors as the age and health of the deceased or injured, past wage history, earning capacity, age and income of heirs, severity and degree of personal injuries, and life expectancy. In addition to the $ 30 million for the workers and their families, the proposed settlement provides $ 11.25 million to settle other claims, including those of contractors and insurance carriers against one another, and to be used as reserve funds. A portion of the $ 30 million would be invested in annuities, which are expected to generate an additional $ 20 million. The tentative settlement also includes provisions for the rebuilding of L'Ambiance Plaza and the distribution to the plaintiffs of some profits from the building for an undetermined number of years. Still unresolved are $ 5.1 million in proposed federal fines against five companies that worked on the project and accusations that they violated federal safety rules. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said, `` I can confirm that <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> is in discussion with the court on a possible settlement. There is no agreement at this point.'' <PERSON> Zampano </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meadow </PERSON> said in their report that if <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> demands full payment of fines from the five companies, it could `` affect seriously the contributions to the settlement fund.''

<TEXT>
 In asking <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> to stay on as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has turned again to a long-time personal friend to staff a key Cabinet post. Last week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced as his first Cabinet appointment his choice of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to be secretary of state. While <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is the better known because of his service with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is just as close to the president-elect. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and another close <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> friend, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> oil millionaire <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, were dubbed the Big Three in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidential campaign _ the longtime friends whose counsel <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> listened to most often. There is speculation that <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> may become <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> secretary. With <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, 58, got the nod from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to become <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary when <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> announced in August that he was leaving the administration to formally become chairman of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidential campaign. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> was sworn in as the nation's 68th <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary on Sept. 15. In his first two months, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> has adopted a low-key approach which emphasized keeping the economy on track and avoiding any controversy that might stir up financial markets before the Nov. 8 election. With the election over, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is expected to move just as cautiously. Many are looking for <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to continue to play a major role in setting the economic as well as the foreign policy course for the new administration. Many of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s major economic initiatives at <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> were in the foreign - policy area It was <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> who three years ago launched an initiative with major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies to coordinate economic policies in an effort to lower <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s huge foreign-trade deficit. That coordination had at its heart a sharp devaluation in the value of the dollar, to stem a flood of foreign products into the country by making them more expensive while reducing the cost of American products on overseas markets. While the dollar devaluation has shown results, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and its allies are now concerned that financial markets might push the dollar down too far in value, raising the specter of higher interest rates and a possible recession in this country. Even the mention last week by sometime <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> economic adviser <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON> that the dollar needed to drop further to cure <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trade problems was enough to send the greenback and the stock market plunging. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> issued a statement Monday that the administration was not abandoning its committment to stabilize the value of the dollar and his comments along with those of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during a beachside interview calmed the markets. Experts are looking for no change from the <LOCATION> Baker </LOCATION> policy in this area. On another international matter, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> has voiced support for <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s plan to revitalize lending to Third World countries. However, the effort has fallen far short of expectations and many believe that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and other countries will force the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to acknowledge next year that more needs to be done in the area of debt forgiveness. Events are also likely to force <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> to quickly address the savings and loan crisis, where estimates of the cost of bailing out hundreds of insolvent institutions have skyrocketed to between $ 50 billion and $ 100 billion. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> has already appointed a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> task force to study the problem. Another <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> study group is looking at the capital gains tax and this too is likely to be a priority in the new administration. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned on a pledge to cut the capital gains tax, which is levied on profits from the sale of stocks, real estate and other investments. The top rate is 33 percent, the same as for salary income, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed cutting it to 15 percent, prompting the charge from Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that such a cut represented a giveaway to the rich. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> has discussed capital gains tax-reduction proposals with top aides and reportedly favors the idea of a `` sliding-scale'' tax that would allow the rate to decline the longer the asset had been held. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is a millionaire whose upbringing and <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> education closely resemble those of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He entered <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> one year after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> graduated. He went on to get a masters degree in business at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and then became an investment banker in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, spending an entire career since 1954 at <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, where he was known as a rainmaker, someone who could attract big clients to the firm. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> was appointed to serve out the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> term of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who resigned in March 1982 following his conviction in the Abscam scandal. He did not seek election to the post but he remained active politically as a troubleshooter for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, serving in 1983 on three different advisory commissions _ on the MX missile, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and foreign aid. When the stock market suffered its record plunge last year, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> again turned to <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, giving him the job of heading a White House panel that investigated the market meltdown. He and the other task force members had only 60 days to figure out what went wrong and recommend ways to fix it. One of the first reports written on the crash, the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> report is still widely regarded as the best. The administration, however, almost immediately distanced itself from <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s main recommendation: a call for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to coordinate regulation of financial markets. But during his confirmation hearing in September, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> hewed to the administration's free-market line, saying he was satisfied with the administration's approach, even though his own proposals were much tougher. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1930 and grew up on a large estate in <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> His family's wealth gave him a substantial start in business. His grandfather, who had arrived from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> during the mid-19th century potato famine, started several electric utilities that later became part of the <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s close friendship with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dates back to the early 1970s when the two men became better acquainted through <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> in 1976, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> tried to recuit him as a partner at <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turned down his friend's offer.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> filed a brief with the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday in an effort to prevent the execution of <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who was 15 when she was convicted of killing a 78-year-old Bible teacher.

 No change will be made in the announced requirement that farmers will have to idle 10 percent of their feed grain base acreage to qualify for price supports and other benefits next year, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said the 10 percent acreage reduction program, or ARP, for 1989 was announced on Sept. 30. But the law also authorizes further adjustments by Nov. 15 if the prospective total supply of corn and other feed grains changes significantly. The 10 percent reduction applies to 1989 crops of corn, sorghum and barley, which carried a 20 percent ARP this year. The ARP for oats will be 5 percent, unchanged from 1988.

<HEAD>Study Finds New Evidence That Pakistan Has Nukes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There is `` convincing evidence'' <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has finally developed atomic weapons, leading to the possibility of a nuclear arms race with its long-time enemy <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, according to a study published Tuesday. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has not tested any atomic weapons and continues to deny it has built them, a public stance similar to three other countries which are also believed to have nuclear weapons, the study said. The others are <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Between 1986 and 1988, after a decade of slow advances, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> appears to have become the fourth country to join this group of unannounced, de facto nuclear powers,'' said the report by the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>. The review was the fourth such recent survey published by the non-profit group, which specializes in national security issues. It was written by <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spector </PERSON>, author of the previous reports. <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> formerly worked on non-proliferation issues at the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> and Natural Resources non-proliferation subcommittee. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said he had no comment on the findings. Five nations have said they have nuclear weapons: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> exploded a single atomic device in 1974 but said it was a non-military explosion. Efforts to halt the spread of nuclear weapons generally have focused on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, the report noted. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> are the chief source of concern, since the two countries have fought three wars in the 41 years since they were created by the separation of colonial <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The evidence that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has the bomb includes production of highly enriched uranium, a key component of atomic weapons; and European reports of a previously clandestine effort by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> officials to smuggle sophisticated nuclear components out of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the report said. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> may be capable of producing two to four atomic weapons, <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> responded to this challenge by continuing the quiet expansion of its nuclear weapons capabilities _ which far overshadow <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s _ while maintaining an ambiguous public stance concerning its nuclear intentions.'' A future war between the two enemies could be devastating, the report said. `` It has been estimated that a dozen nuclear weapons used against military targets in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> could cause over a million casualties.'' The Pakistani program is a dilemma for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> said, noting <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is a prime recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid at the same time <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are pushing <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> not to develop atomic weapons. Two years ago, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> did not possess nuclear weapons, a certification required by Capitol Hill before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid program could go ahead. But in recent months, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been less direct in asserting that the Pakistanis do n't have atomic weapons. President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has shown more of an interest in stopping the spread of atomic weapons in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> said. `` I think it may get more attention in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration,'' he said. <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> suggested <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy should be aimed at developing `` some sort of mechanism, some kind of regional arrangement, to bring <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> into negotiations. The concept is to find a way to persuade both antagonists to restrain themselves. It will be difficult.'' The report also said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has `` a substantial, undeclared nuclear arsenal,'' which includes more sophisticated weapons than previously thought. <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> explained that there are indications the Israelis have some bombs based on thermonuclear _ fusion _ principles, which are more powerful than fission weapons. The Israelis have never admitted possessing nuclear weapons.

As part of the same, five-year `` demonstration project'' to entice agents and staffers to work in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, those who agree to move to the nation's largest city for specified periods also will receive lump-sum bonuses of $ 20,000. The pay increases were set up by the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal 1989, which was signed into law Sept. 29. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> made no public announcement when the project became law, even though it had been trying for several years to find a mechanism to raise salaries in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> field office. Some 300 jobs are vacant because bureau pay has not kept pace with the city's cost of living, particularly housing. The resignation rate in the field office had been running at about 4 percent annually. So while <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents elsewhere in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> receive an average base salary of $ 39,000 a year, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> agents at that level got raises to $ 48,750 on Oct. 23, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and staffers in other offices will receive the same 4.1 percent raise that other federal workers will get on Jan. 1. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said it was too soon to tell whether the lump-sum offer had attracted any volunteers to work in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said last week he thought the pay increase would solve the problem in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office _ the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s largest, with more than 1,200 agents and 900 support workers The pay boost affects all agents and about two-thirds of the support staff _ namely those workers who are subject to mandatory transfers, according to the law.

<HEAD>Case Dropped Against Women Accused of Taking $50,000 From Ill

<TEXT>
 A nurse's aide accused of draining $ 50,000 from an 84-year-old patient's bank accounts and of neglect that may have contributed to his death will keep the money and avoid trial because prosecutors say they have no case. Seminole-Brevard State Attorney <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfinger </PERSON> said Monday he lacks evidence to prosecute <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> VanDyke </PERSON>, 42, on charges of grand theft and exploitation of the elderly. Ms. <PERSON> VanDyke </PERSON>, who is free on $ 2,000 bond and lives in a <LOCATION> Sanford </LOCATION> mobile home she bought with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Reek </PERSON>'s money, said Monday she has been vindicated. The investigator who ran the case, however, said prosecutors have plenty of evidence. `` If I did n't feel that I had a case, I would n't have directed the investigator to go over and arrest the woman,'' said <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Walthers </PERSON>. `` She broke the law and she needs to be prosecuted.'' And a state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> counselor, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaulin </PERSON>, said in a March 3 report that Ms. <PERSON> VanDyke </PERSON> exploited and neglected Reek. `` There are reasons to believe that said neglect directly contributed to Mr. <PERSON> Reek </PERSON>'s death,'' he said. Reek died March 22 of tuberculosis. The day Ms. <PERSON> VanDyke </PERSON> gained control of Reek's accounts, she withdrew $ 38,000. She withdrew $ 6,000 the next day, sheriff's reports show Detectives say a total of $ 91,000 is missing from Reek's estate. They traced $ 50,000 to Ms. <PERSON> VanDyke </PERSON> and charged her May 10. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s speedy-trial law requires that people charged with felonies go to trial within 175 days of their arrest. The deadline for Ms. <PERSON> VanDyke </PERSON>'s trial passed Nov. 1, meaning she can petition to have the case dismissed. She said Tuesday she would file a petition within a few days. <PERSON> Wolfinger </PERSON> could fight the petition, but would have to try Ms. <PERSON> VanDyke </PERSON> within 15 days. Ms. <PERSON> VanDyke </PERSON> said she took the money because <PERSON> Reek </PERSON> wanted her to have it. `` We loved each other. I took care of him,'' she said. `` I cry every day because I loved that man so much. I loved that man more than anything in the world. I love working with elderly people.''

 A man convicted of manslaughter has been ordered to spend New Year's Eve trying to prevent the kind of tragedy that occurred last Dec. 31 when his stroke-of-midnight gunshot killed a young woman. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, 52, wo n't be sentenced until late January for the shooting that neighbors say still haunts him. But Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Richette </PERSON> on Monday directed him to guard his <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> block from reckless New Year's Eve gunfire. <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> was shooting a semi-automatic gun into the air at midnight last New Year's Eve when he staggered and misfired, killing <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, 18, while she stood on a nearby porch, Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said. The prosecutor said she will ask for a five - to 10-year prison sentence for <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> `` You are appointed captain of that block for the purpose of discouraging and persuading everybody not to shoot live bullets,'' the judge told <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>. `` If one live bullet does get fired, I'm holding you responsible. `` I want you patrolling that block. This will be your way of redeeming yourself.'' `` It was a good -LRB- order -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` I guess with his past and everyone knowing him, they thought that was a good thing to do.'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, reckless endangerment and weapons offenses in connection with Ms. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>'s death Neighbors said <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, who has several children and grandchildren, has been haunted by the slaying and has not been able to sleep well since. `` He has suffered tremendously,'' said <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, 42, who has lived next door to the <ORGANIZATION> Pryors </ORGANIZATION> for more than 20 years. `` He feels awful, because she was so young. He's not a man without a conscience.'' `` On this block, I feel almost certain that we wo n't hear any gunshots,'' Ms. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. `` Everyone knew the young girl, and we all knew the <ORGANIZATION> Pryors </ORGANIZATION>. It was devastating. Of course, he realizes he was wrong.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> `` had went visiting on New Year's Eve, and she was going to come home at midnight to wish her mother Happy New Year,'' said neighbor <PERSON> Essie </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON>, 80. `` She got as far as the porch where she was visiting and that's when it happened.'' The judge told <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> his street has been `` traumatized by this death.'' `` This was outrageous,'' she said. `` This was irresponsible, immature and reckless. You are lucky only one person was killed.''

<HEAD>Bail of Eight Defendants Revoked as Treason Trial Comes to Close</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge Tuesday revoked the bail of eight defendants as he prepared to deliver the verdict in a three-year trial of the leaders of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s biggest anti-apartheid group. The 19 black defendants, who belong to the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, have pleaded innocent to charges of treason, terrorism, murder and subversion related to an allegation that they sought to promote violence in order to make <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> ungovernable. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Kees </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON> began delivering a summary of the trial and is expected to announce the verdicts in two or three days. Sixteen of the 19 black defendants had been granted bail during the trial. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON> did not explain why he revoked the bail of only eight defendants. The three most prominent defendants _ senior leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> _ have been denied bail and have spent 40 months in jail. They are <PERSON> Popo </PERSON> <PERSON> Molefe </PERSON>, 36, who was the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s national secretary; <LOCATION> Terror </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lekota </LOCATION>, 40, who was its publicity secretary, and <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, 40, who was secretary of its <ORGANIZATION> Transvaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> branch. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s largest opposition group, was founded in 1983 and includes more than 600 anti-apartheid groups with about 2 million members. It was banned in February. The charges against the 19 arise from violence and mob killings in black townships south of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> in September 1984 that were the start of two years of nationwide unrest in which more than 2,500 people were killed. Treason and murder carry a maximum penalty of death. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON>, who has presided over the non-jury trial since it began in June 1985, has sole responsibility for the verdict and sentencing. He was initially assisted by two lay experts, but one was dismissed because he had signed a petition supported by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> opposing constitutional changes that excluded blacks from <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON> said Tuesday the defendants were not being prosecuted for their political views. He said it was possible to commit treason even if one believed a new government would serve the interests of a majority of the people. Under <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s policy of apartheid, the 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs, which are controlled by the 5 million whites.

<HEAD>Panel Offers No Hints On Bases To Be Closed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A special commission created to identify unneeded military bases for closure met a congressional deadline on Tuesday for describing its `` evaluation process,'' but dropped no hints about individual bases that might end up on its hit list. The Commission on Base Realignment and Closure, in a 2 -LCB- - page statement, outlined a five-step process `` for the evaluation of major military installations within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, its territories, commonwealths and possessions. `` We're going to be running everything under the microscope, and this simply explains how,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbee </PERSON>, a spokesman for the panel. `` You ca n't make any inference from this that any base is or is not likely to be recommended for closure. You'll have to wait until Dec. 31 for that.'' Legislation signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last month authorized the 12-member citizens' commission to review the nation's military bases and to decide which are outmoded and can be closed, at a projected annual savings of $ 2 billion to $ 5 billion. The panel has until Dec. 31 to report its findings to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, who may forward the list to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> if he wishes. Should he decide to do so, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can veto the entire list but can not act to protect individual bases, as it often has in the past. The `` all-or-nothing'' legal procedure is viewed as offering the best chance in more than a decade to actually close unneeded military bases over the objection of local congressmen. According to Tuesday's statement, the commission is first grouping together `` by mission'' the military facilities across the country; for example, all Army depots, all <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> fighter bases, all <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> submarine ports. `` The second step will evaluate bases within the category to determine whether additional mission capacity exists beyond current, future or mobilization requirements,'' the panel added. After reviewing overall capacity, the commission said it would begin evaluating each individual base on five factors: mission suitability, including geographical environment and ease of deployment; the physical facilities in place; the quality of those facilities; the quality of life for personnel such as housing, and community support. The bases that rank at the bottom of each `` mission'' list will then be considered for closure by determining if other bases higher on the list are in a position to become `` receiving'' bases, the panel added. `` The combination of possible realignments and the closing of the base will be considered as a package for cost evaluation ...,'' the statement says. In the final step, the `` package'' of a `` closing base'' and `` a receiving base'' will be reviewed for environmental concerns such as hazardous waste problems and for socio-economic impact `` in the form of evaluation of the potential closure's impact on local employment.'' <PERSON> Abbee </PERSON> said the commission is in the midst of applying the procedure to 871 large military facilities. He declined to predict how many of them might end up on the recommended closure list.

<HEAD>ABC Launches `War and Remembrance,' But NBC Wins Week</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first episode of `` War and Remembrance,'' the opening salvo from <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s big gun in the November ratings war, placed fourth in the weekly Nielsens, not good enough to prevent <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> from winning the week. The No. 1 show of the week was a one-hour episode of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show'' in which Cliff and <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> became grandparents. It had a 30.3 rating and a 47 share, the highest-rated `` Cosby'' since last March. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> dominated the top 10 and won the week ending Nov. 12 with an average, prime-time rating of 15.6. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was second with 14.0 and CBS third with 11.5. Each rating point equals 904,000 homes with television. The share is a percentage of sets in use. `` War and Remembrance'' opened Sunday with a 21.8 rating and a 31 share. The national rating, released Tuesday, was lower than the 17-city overnights available Monday. The first installment's rating reportedly met <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s guarantee to sponsors, but the network was somewhat disappointed since ratings for multi-episode miniseries often start and finish at a high but sag in the middle. The miniseries is a sequel to `` The Winds of War,'' which opened in 1983 with a rating of 39.1 and a 53 share. `` War and Remembrance'' runs 18 hours in seven parts, but the story does n't conclude until sometime next year when <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to run the rest of the 32-hour World War II saga. Because of delays in its other programming due to the writers' strike, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> rushed the first part of the miniseries to air this month, one of four ratings `` sweeps'' periods each year when network affiliate ratings are measured Originally the entire 32 hours was to have run in 1989. The 10 top-rated shows of the week were: `` The Cosby Show,'' `` Cheers'' and `` Golden Girls,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` War and Remembrance,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` 60 Minutes,'' CBS; `` Growing Pains,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Empty Nest,'' `` L.A. Law'' and `` Dear <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' all <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. The theatrical film `` Back to the Future,'' which <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> ran against `` War and Remembrance'' on Sunday, placed 11th. The only new shows to make the top 20 were <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Empty Nest,'' `` Dear John'' and `` Unsolved Mysteries.'' CBS' new comedies were in trouble. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>'' and <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>'s `` The <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> Show,'' plus `` Dirty Dancing'' and `` Raising Miranda,'' were among the 10 lowest-rated network shows of the week. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Knightwatch'' had an inauspicious premiere in second-to-last place. The bottom 10 were: CBS' election-night coverage, `` Police Story,'' `` <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>,'' `` Dirty Dancing,'' `` National Love and Sex Test,'' `` The <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> Show,'' `` West 57th,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>,'' `` Knightwatch'' and `` Raising Miranda.'' In news, the three networks finished in a virtual dead heat. `` CBS Evening News'' and `` ABC World News Tonight'' had a rating of 10.7 and a share of 19, barely ahead of `` NBC Nightly News'' with a 10.5 rating and 19 share.

<HEAD>Panel Recommends Major Overhaul of Wetlands Protection</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government-sponsored panel of diverging interests on Tuesday recommended a major overhaul of wetlands protection, with states assuming responsibility for a national goal of creating more wetlands than are being destroyed. The National Wetlands Policy Forum, convened by the <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the proposed goal of ending the conversion of wetlands to other uses did not mean every single parcel of marshy ground would have to be preserved, but enough wetlands should be created or restored to outweigh the losses. `` The federal government has hundreds of wetlands rules, but there is no guiding principle, no overriding goal,'' said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, who served as chairman of the forum. `` The result is confusion equal to rush hour on the beltway.'' The 20-member forum embraced representatives of builders, industry, environmental groups, state and local governments and federal agencies. Its recommendations were presented as a consensus package, and <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> and others said the group would oppose attempts to pick out particular measures from the more than 100 recommendations to support or oppose. About half the 200 million acres of marshes and bogs, fens, swamps and other wetlands that were present in the lower 48 states when European settlement began have been converted to other uses _ farms, housing developments, shopping centers, airports and everything else that humans do. In recent decades, though, environmental benefits of wetlands have been recognized increasingly: storage of flood water, cleansing of pollution, protection of wildlife, spawning and nursing of 60 percent to 90 percent of the nation's commercial fish catch, recharging groundwater and controlling erosion. A major study in the 1970s estimated that losses over the two previous decades had proceeded at 400,000 acres _ half the size of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> _ to 500,000 acres per year. No one knows if that still holds true. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> uses 350,000 acres and a recent congressional study used 275,000 acres. Among major recommendations of the forum: _ A national agricultural wetlands reserve which would pay farmers to transfer land or easements to wetlands preservation trusts These trusts would operate somewhat like the Nature Conservancy and other private groups to hold reserved land. The reserve should aim to protect 5 million existing acres and restore half as much, the forum said. _ Each state should enact wetlands protection plans which, if approved by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, would qualify the state to take over many, though not all, of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s wetlands protection jobs Only <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> has taken over <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> wetland regulation tasks so far. _ States with approved programs might be able to issue `` regional general permits which would allow the conversion of a limited amount of ecologically low value wetland areas in exchange for full compensatory mitigation. _ Federal activities would have to be consistent with approved state plans, just as they now must be in states with approved <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> plans _ `` Regulatory authorities should take any necessary action, including amending existing regulations, to prevent the willful alteration of wetland characteristics to circumvent regulatory jurisdictions.'' _ Make the definitions of wetlands uniform Some 50 different definitions of wetlands are in use throughout the federal government. _ A major effort to identify public lands where wetlands could be restored, with priority attention to the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coast's `` extremely high wetlands losses from erosion and subsidence, largely as a result of government flood control and other water resource projects The report noted, `` The fact that the protection of wetlands makes good economic as well as environmental sense for society but not necessarily for the individual owning them is central to much of the conflict over wetlands protection policies,'' and a conservative advocacy group singled out that point as one weakness. `` Property owners have a right to develop their property,'' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivett </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, adding that `` there is no mention in this report of the Fifth Amendment problem.'' He referred to court rulings that some land use regulations can be so burdensome as to amount to a `` taking'' of property for public use that requires compensation to the owner under the Constitution's Fifth Amendment <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hookano </PERSON> of the foundation said the group believes major wetlands need protection, but he said the report does not go beyond recommendations of the regulatory task force chaired by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in 1982. `` It's irresponsible to recommend a program without a price tag,'' he said, arguing that the agricultural wetlands reserve could cost billions of dollars. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, whose leaders took part in the study, endorsed the report, but one environmental group that did not participate said it had `` serious concerns about delegating authority to the states'' because state and local governments were more vulnerable to pressure from development interests than the federal government.'' <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Malakoff </PERSON> of Friends of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> said, `` We're suspicious of state control. We're not sure the states have the resources to regulate in this area.''

<TEXT>
 The financial markets were hoping for good news Wednesday with the release of the merchandise trade balance for September. Most economists expect a decline in imports to narrow the trade gap to $ 10.5 billion from the $ 12.2 billion August deficit. If the deficit exceeds that amount, market analysts fear it could trigger a selloff in the dollar, stock and bond markets. Meanwhile, there were these developments in the economic picture Tuesday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>STOCK MARKET</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.09 points to 2,077.17 in a particularly slow session, reflecting widespread reluctance to participate ahead of the monthly trade report.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>RETAIL SALES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Retail sales rose 0.9 percent in October to a seasonally adjusted $ 135.6 billion, the strongest increase in seven months. Sales figures are not adjusted for inflation and many of the increases can be attributed to higher prices. For the first 10 months of the year, overall sales were up 6.1 percent over the same period of 1987, barely keeping ahead of the inflation rate.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.4 percent in October, the strongest increase in three months. It followed smaller increases of 0.2 percent in September and 0.3 percent in August, and a big jump of 1.1 percent in July.

 <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> is studying whether to participate in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s space program, a move that would cost $ 10 million, a government official said Tuesday.

 Slightly radioactive water spilled at the <LOCATION> Oyster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> nuclear plant Tuesday, forcing officials to declare the lowest of four emergency categories. Nobody was contaminated and no injuries were reported, said plant spokesman <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Polon </PERSON>. The water spilled onto a reactor floor when a seal that is normally used to cap the flow failed during maintenance, <PERSON> Polon </PERSON> said. About six employees were working on the device when the water spilled. The accident prompted declaration of an `` unusual event,'' because water flow exceeded the normal 25 gallons per minute, <PERSON> Polon </PERSON> said, estimating the flow at between 25 and 50 gallons per minute. The declaration, the lowest of four emergency categories, began at 2:40 a.m. and ended at 4:30 a.m., <PERSON> Polon </PERSON> said. About 10,000 gallons of water were collected before repairs were completed, <PERSON> Polon </PERSON> said. The water went into the plant's drainage system, where it was recirculated. <LOCATION> Oyster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> has been shut down since Sept. 29 for maintenance and refueling.

<HEAD>Thousands March For Peace In Salvador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of peasants, students and workers marched through the capital Tuesday to demand that the U.S.-backed government negotiate with leftist rebels to end the 9-year-old civil war. The march coincided with a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>. Peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is among the topics being discussed during the week-long meeting of delegates from 31 nations. An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people marched in the procession that stretched more than 2 miles. Protesters walked from the city's eastern edge to the hotel where the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> meeting is being held in western <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> `` The struggle for peace is the duty of all!'' chanted the marchers beneath hundreds of blue-and-white <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> flags, white flags symbolyzing peace and banners with slogans demanding an end to the bloodshed. Organizers of the event, including dozens of anti-government labor, peasant, student, church and human rights organizations, called it `` The Great March for Peace and a Political Solution to the Conflict.'' Participants represented a cross-section of Salvadoran society, with straw-hatted, sandaled peasants walking alongside factory workers and neatly attired white-collar workers. The Salvadoran armed forces, battling a Marxist-led insurgency, had said the march was part of a guerrilla plan to disrupt the capital during the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> meeting. The army also accused organizers of seeking to provoke government forces. But the march was peaceful as both armed forces and demonstrators apparently made efforts to avoid violence. Troops and police took up positions a few blocks from the Sheraton Hotel, where the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> is meeting, to prevent the marchers from reaching the general assembly site. Instead, demonstrators gathered at a nearby traffic circle where they sang songs and listened to speeches. The war has killed an estimated 65,000 people, most of them civilians. The centrist government of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> demands that the guerrillas lay down their arms and incorporate themselves into the democratic process. The guerrillas and their civilian political supporters contend <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s government is a facade for military domination and that elections have been a farce. The guerrillas last week declared a unilateral truce for the duration of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> meeting and renewed a call for negotiations with the government. The army rejected the move as propaganda, and on Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said the rebels violated their cease-fire by shooting at government forces. In a broadcast over their clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION>, the rebels charged the army with `` provocation,'' and said any fighting was the result of army offensive action. Three rounds of government-rebel negotiations in recent years have been fruitless. `` The government has not demonstrated sincerity in previous negotiations,'' said an <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> worker taking part in the march. `` But negotiation is the only way. By pursuing military means, there will only be more dead.'' He declined to be identified. Activists in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> are reluctant to be quoted by name. In the early 1980s, soldiers and death squads linked to the military were blamed for the kidnap and murder of thousands of suspected leftists. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, in his address Monday to <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegates, said the guerrillas' expressed desire to resume negotiations was merely `` tactical.'' He accused the rebels of pursuing `` a strategic maneuver to destroy democracy through democracy's own liberties.''

<HEAD>Today's Women Living Longer, But AIDS Poses Threat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With AIDS increasingly striking women, those women at highest risk of exposure should make extradordinary efforts to avoid contracting the deadly disease, even if that means possible abandonment, physical harm or never having children, a private study said Tuesday. The report from the <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, `` The American Woman, 1988-1989,'' noted that AIDS is growing faster among women than among men or children. Figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control show the number of AIDS cases rose 106.1 percent for women from 1987 to 1988, 49.5 percent for children and 31.4 percent for men. To combat this rapid increase, the new report _ a compilation of existing studies _ said programs aimed at educating those most at risk are `` imperative,'' even if the consequence of knowledge is the serious disruption of lives. The study said those most at risk are intravenous drug users and sexual partners of male intravenous drug users and bisexual men. Yet many of these vulnerable women, the report said, do n't know the danger they are in because they do not realize that the behavior of their sex partners puts them at high risk of contracting AIDS or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. And some women trying to avoid contracting AIDS face additional problems. `` For a woman to take the steps necessary to avoid sexual and perinatal transmission of AIDS may mean risking rejection, abandonment, even physical harm at the hands of her partner, and the disruption of sexual and @ or family relationships,'' the report said. `` In some cases, it may mean the decision not to have children.'' To educate these women, the report said, they often must first be persuaded `` that their lives are worth saving and that it is within their power to prevent the deadly disease'' from infecting them. Only when these women, who often feel helpless and depressed over their lives, believe their actions will make a difference can traditional AIDS-education programs have a real impact, the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> estimated that 2,839 women were diagnosed with AIDS during the first 11 months of 1988, compared with 1,377 for the same period a year earlier. For men, the comparable numbers were 24,538 and 18,674; for children 474 and 317. Worse than the numbers themselves, the report noted, was an assessment by the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> that there are 50 times to 80 times as many women who are infected with the precusor virus to AIDS as have been diagnosed with the disease itself. The 443-page book, which addresses issues ranging from the presence of women in politics to women's progress in law enforcement, was prepared as a challenge to the new administration of President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rix </PERSON>, the report's editor, said she was encouraged by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vision of a `` kinder, gentler nation.'' `` He can change the dream into reality by supporting the needs of women,'' <PERSON> Rix </PERSON> told a news conference. One area needing change, the report said, is the quality of health care offered women with limited choices. The report said that `` a country as prosperous and ingenious as this one is should not tolerate the great disparities that exist between men and women, between the poor and the non-poor, and between whites and minorities in something so vital and basic as health care.'' The report also said: _ Of the 37 million Americans without health insurance, women are most vulnerable _ The poverty rate is higher among women, especially older women, and they must rely on inadequate public programs _ Life expectancy for women has increased rapidly, from 73.1 years for females born in 1960 to 78.2 years for women born in 1985 The book was published by <PERSON> W.W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> for the institute, which is a non-partisan research arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> for Women's Issues

On Thursday, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> will meet with President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to talk about priorities for future arms control negotiations with the Soviets, the American trade and budget deficits which have upset international financial markets and prospects for resolving the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict, said Price. `` The <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> will be high on the agenda,'' Price said. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will discuss the latest developments in that troubled area, including this week's <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> declaration of an independent Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and the council's renunciation of terrorism <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has pledged to commit his administration to the search for a solution in the seemingly intractable dispute. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, along with other <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies, long have urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to pressure its ally <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> into negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> if it recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and forswears terrorism. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, 63, who is the longest-serving <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> leader with nine years in office, has meet <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> numerous times in his role as vice president. `` We know him as a friend, we admire him as a man of unrivaled experience and we respect him because he stands for all that is best in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' she said before leaving <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Barring unforeseen events, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> will be in office through almost all of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tenure. The deficit problem, as well as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern about the integration of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> in 1992, also will come up at Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> will receive <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, as well as Soviet physicist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, at <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> guest quarters. She is the first leader to stay in the 19th-century mansion since it was shut down six years ago for extensive renovations. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who was last here in July 1987, also is scheduled to hold talks with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> before flying home Thursday.

 Palestinian refugees outside the Israeli-occupied territories welcomed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declaration of a new state Tuesday, but some criticized the implied recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` I'm as happy as if I had won millions of dinars,'' said 23-year-old <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Salhi </PERSON>, whose family fled to the Al-Hussein refugee camp in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lydda </LOCATION> in what is now <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> emirate, teacher <PERSON> Irtifaa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gameel </PERSON> <PERSON> Khateeb </PERSON> said: `` It's lovely to hear the term <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state.. but the Palestinian is still being beaten up'' in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. More than 300 Palestinians have been killed and thousands wounded since an uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation began in the occupied lands Dec. 8, 1987. One of more than 300,000 Palestinians who live in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, economist <PERSON> Tewfik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Latif </PERSON>, called the declaration `` a good political step that represents an embarrassment to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They should now prove their good intentions.'' He referred to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refusal to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> until it endorsed <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security Council Resolution 242, which implies acceptance of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and renounced terrorism. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, meeting in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, proclaimed a Palestinian state with <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as its capital and endorsed the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution while stressing Palestinian rights to self-determination. It also said guerrilla actions against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would be limited to military targets in the occupied territories, where the Palestinian state presumably would be established. The council serves as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> legislature. Some pessimism was evident. `` I think the Americans will not recognize the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> regardless of what concessions we extend,'' said businessman <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. `` They will now say what the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> did is inadequate, we want more.'' A dentist at the Al-Hussein camp, <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Khadra </PERSON>, said: `` As a political step it means the recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and we reject that.'' His family is from Safad in what is now <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> groups opposed to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said the declaration was `` dangerous'' and threatened the unity of Palestinians involved in the uprising. In the <PERSON> Jebel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> district of <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Saadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabbour </PERSON>, a physician from a Safad family, served Palestinian sweets to visitors at his clinic to celebrate the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> announcement. <PERSON> Dabbour </PERSON> said he was `` full of happiness. ... I have been waiting for this for four decades.'' Asked about recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he said: `` It is an evil that we can not avoid.'' <PERSON> Abdul-Munim </PERSON> <PERSON> Subeihi </PERSON>, a butcher in the Al-Hussein camp, said his family fled <LOCATION> Lydda </LOCATION> in 1948 and he will return someday. `` I was prosecuted -LRB- in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> -RRB- ... on charges of smuggling weapons to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I will go back -LRB- to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> -RRB-. ... I am very happy. There is something now I can depend on.'' <PERSON> Shukri </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON>, a taxi driver who came to <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>'s Nuzha camp from <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION> in 1968, said: `` All the people I drove today said they are celebrating the new beginning, a bright one, the Palestinian state. Long live Palestine.'' About 26,000 refugees are crowded into Al-Hussein camp, on the slope of a hill in the Jordanian capital. Scores of children played in front of simple concrete houses along narrow dirt lanes that intersect the main paved road through the camp. The main road was lined with stalls for the weekly vegetable market and customers crowded around them. More than 100,000 registered refugees live in five official camps in the <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> area, and at least 100,000 more live in five camps in northern <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> has about 800,000 registered Palestinian refugees.

 vehicle by the drag of the engine, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. Meantime, the agency said it has ended a five-year investigation into alleged power-brake failure in <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s 1980 X-body cars, finding that `` no defect trend'' existed. The allegations of a defect had been cited as contributing to a brake problem linked to 1,417 accidents, 18 deaths and 400 injuries, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. A federal court after a lengthy trial refused to order a recall of 1.1 million 1980 X-body cars. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> opened its inquiry into the Sundance and Shadow vehicles, a total of 345,000 cars, as an engineering analysis, the second highest level of investigation. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said the company was cooperating with the investigation. The manufacturer, in a service bulletin on the problem earlier this year, described the problem as a failure of the engine to return to a lower rate of idle if it were driven while cold. `` In terms of ever feeling that you're out of control of the car and you ca n't stop it _ No. ... It is just slightly higher than the idle normally would be when the engine is warm,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. She said the company believes no braking problem is involved. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> also began seven lower-level investigations into alleged defects involving cars made by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and two foreign manufacturers, <PERSON> Subaru </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION>. One involved three complaints of the wheel and hub assembly falling off 1986-1987 <ORGANIZATION> Pontiac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fieros </ORGANIZATION> because of metal fatigue. The problem resulted in three accidents but no injuries, according to unconfirmed reports received by <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>. The preliminary evaluation involves 104,000 vehicles. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, the maker of the cars, pledged to cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> investigation, but spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> added, `` Just because there is an investigation does n't necessarily mean there is a defect.'' <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> also opened preliminary evaluations into allegations that: _ The power-steering pump on 1987 <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firebirds </ORGANIZATION> and Camaros fractures, causing a loss of power steering The investigation, based on 10 complaints, involves 250,000 vehicles. _ The bracket bolts holding the steering column on the 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> F-150 light truck come off, causing the column to fall The investigation, based on two complaints, involves 80,000 vehicles. _ The adjustable front-seat headrest on the 1986-1988 Ford Taurus and Sable can not be kept in a raised position The investigation, based on three complaints, involves about 1.2 million vehicles. _ The front-seat bracket of the 1986-1987 Taurus and <PERSON> Sable </PERSON> fails, allowing the seat to move nd making control of the cars difficult The investigation, based on four complaints, involves 420,000 vehicles. _ A faulty oil-pressure gauge sensor on the 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Subaru </ORGANIZATION> GL fails to work, allowing oil to leak in the engine compartment, where it causes a fire The investigation, based on three complaints, involves 157,000 vehicles. _ A faulty cable can cause the battery to short-circuit on the 1988 Saab 900 Turbo The investigation in the 5,000 cars was prompted by a Saab service bulletin. Besides the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> X-cars, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> also closed without action investigations into alleged: _ Cruise-control response in <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 G-series vans with 6.2-liter diesel engines _ Driver-seat failure in <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 Lincoln Mark VII _ Rear-wheel lockup in <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s 1983-1984 F-250 trucks _ Windshield wiper failure on <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s 1987 Jeep Wrangler _ Seat failure in <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION>'s 1986 Montero

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said Tuesday there are `` positive elements'' in a new <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> policy statement but it rejected a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> proclamation of an independent Palestinian state. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the status of territories under Israeli occupation `` can not be determined by unilateral acts of either side but only through a process of negotiations. A declaration of independent Palestinian statehood is such a unilateral act.'' The statement early Tuesday in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, did not specify the borders of the new territory but it presumably encompasses the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which have been under Israeli control since 1967 At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration sees `` positive elements'' to the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> statement, including its acceptance of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions 242 and 338. These lay the groundwork for a comprehensive settlement to the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict and implicitly recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. Successive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administrations have conditioned the opening of a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> on its acceptance of those resolutions. The administration's response left ambiguous whether it sees the new policy statement as representing a significant shift in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> stance and whether it could provide the basis for a changed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters that `` I think the jury is still out. If indeed there is specific recognition of ... Resolution 242, that would be a very important step forward. And I have to wait until I'm sure that that is exactly what's taken place. But it would be something that we've been encouraging for a long, long time.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declaration left open the possibility that the incoming administration may give high priority to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> during its early months in office. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself said he already has talked with Secretary of State-designate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> about it, and said, `` Obviously we're going to be concerned about the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the administration has not seen the final text but promised it would receive `` serious study.'' `` Our objective is a comprehensive peace,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` Direct negotiations must be at heart of the negotiating process. Palestinian participation is required at every stage of negotiations. All participants in the negotiations must renounce terrorism and violence and each must agree on the accepted international basis of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions 224 and 338.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declaration renounces terrorist activities against civilian targets but the administration insists that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> must forswear all terrorist activities, among other conditions. The administration was more ambivalent in its attitude toward the outcome of the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> meeting than was <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, whose Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> ruled out all negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` because they are opposed to peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said it was not clear whether the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> initiative constituted an olive branch to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> added to the confusion about future steps with his response to a question on whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was ready to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's under consideration. We do not know exactly what is in the agreement,'' he said. That statement went far beyond what his official spokesmen were willing to say but it was not clear whether <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> understood the question, which a reporter shouted at him at the conclusion of a departure ceremony on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION> of the White House for visiting West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> quickly amended <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remark by saying, `` What he was referring to was the meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the fact that we would have to consider and we are considering the results of those meetings, but that we have reached no decisions on them.'' Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, wrote a letter to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urging him to withhold recognition of the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> decisions and to encourage <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies to do the same. `` The declaration falls short of the statutory standard'' set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy since 1975, as well as a bill passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> several years ago, states that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` must expressly recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> decision does not do so, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> added.

<HEAD>Negotiators Reach Tentative Agreement on Namibian Independence,
Angola</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Negotiators reached tentative agreement Tuesday on a plan that will bring Namibian independence from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in early 1989 and a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> over a 27-month period, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. The agreement was worked out during five days of negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> involving officials from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. It is subject to final approval by their respective governments. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, insisting on anonymity, said current plans call for the formal agreement to be signed in early December. The accord was mediated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>. The plan calls for implementation, starting in February, of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution designed to end <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 73-year rule over <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s last colony Under the plan, elections for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s first independent government will be held in August and the new regime will take office in early 1990, the officials said. A second part of the agreement envisions the withdrawal of two-thirds of the more than 50,000 Cuban troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> during the one-year period ending in December 1989. The agreement also calls for the gradual redeployment of remaining Cuban troops northward, away from the Namibian border and from the stronghold of anti-communist Angolan rebels backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, no details were disclosed but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s chief negotiator, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heerden </PERSON>, said, `` All parties have agreed to take a document home to their governments.'' He said the document would be the basis for a final agreement `` if the parties accept it.'' <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> first sent troops to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in 1975 to help the fledgling independent government, newly freed from <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colonial rule, fend off military incursions from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> which was concerned about communist penetration of the region. With the exception of a residual force, all the Cubans will be back home by early 1991 under the timetable agreed to in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Left unanswered is the fate of the U.S.-backed rebel movement, known by its Portuguese initials, <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has been the principal supplier of the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> forces for years, ferrying equipment across the Namibian border to the rebel stronghold in southeast <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. But with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> apparently intending on removing its forces from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, that country will no longer be able to continue its resupply operation because of logistical problems. President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> will continue, but <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials have indicated that the South African resupply role can not be duplicated. On the other hand, the officials said that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has played an indispensable role in supporting the Angolan Army and that the removal of the Cuban troops will shift the military balance in <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>'s favor. <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> has sought to bring an end to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s internal conflict by calling for national reconciliation negotiations between <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government and the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels But the Angolan government has rejected negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, calling instead on the rebels to lay down their arms and join in a national reconstruction effort.

 At least 13 nations recognized the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state declared Tuesday, most of them Arab or Moslem backers of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, but <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was cautious and <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> opposed to <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> condemned the move. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, welcomed the decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and said it opens `` fresh opportunities. for progress towards peace.'' Countries recognizing the state included <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> stopped short of extending diplomatic recognition but said they supported the move by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which acts as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> legislature. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> read a statement to reporters saying: `` The establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state is an important step toward achievement of a peaceful settlement of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> crisis through agreement among all parties to the conflict.'' Only <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> among Arab countries has signed a peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> called the declaration `` premature.'' <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> said it was a step forward in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process but that a state without territory could not be recognized, and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> described the declaration as `` no breakthrough.'' In <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> said the `` step of enormous importance ... will obligate the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to review their policy stand on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process.'' <PERSON> Sten </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, said the decision `` could be a historic step that opens the way for peace and reconciliation.'' <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> said it `` salutes the courageous decision of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> ... within the framework of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolutions and international law.'' The Greek government has diplomatic relations with both <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the `` foundations of the state-to-be are unsound and unenduring.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is Moslem but not Arab. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> said it hopes `` this state will realize the hopes and aspirations of the Palestinian people in building up their national and pan-Arab identity on their national soil.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which backs Palestinian factions opposed to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, made no official statement. A commentator on the state radio said: `` The road to liberation, just rights and peace is the road of struggle and refusal of any surrender in front of the enemy.'' A statement from the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uprising </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> called the declaration a `` catastrophe'' and said of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and his supporters: `` Their most dangerous aspect is that they threaten the unity of our people inside the occupied territories and deal a blow to the unity of the land -LRB- <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> -RRB-.'' The Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said: `` This is a black day in our history, as they are trying to fool our people through declaring an illusion independence to cover their renouncing most of the Palestinian territory.'' <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s official news agency quoted Prime Minister <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> as saying his country `` has always recognized the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> represents their will.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> set limited goals Tuesday for his farewell meeting next month with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the administration has proposed the session be held over lunch on Dec. 7 at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Metropolitan Museum of Art. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the meeting, in which President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will participate, will not be in the nature of a summit. But mindful of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s escalation of the agenda at their meeting in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> two years ago, he said, `` We'll just have to see what comes up.'' At the session, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> plans to seek Soviet confirmation that the four-part agenda for superpower relations, which included arms control and human rights, would be carried over to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. The two other agenda items for the four Reagan-Gorbachev summit meetings as well as the talks Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> held with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> were regional conflicts, such as the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and U.S.-Soviet bilateral problems. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is likely to seek a reaffirmation from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of a Soviet pledge to withdraw all Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The plans for the meeting at the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> art museum have not yet been approved by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the officials said. They stressed they did not expect <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to complete a new treaty scaling back <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet strategic nuclear weapons. That will be left for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to pursue, the officials said. The meeting is to be held in conjunction with a speech by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who takes office Jan. 20, is already committed to pursuing a summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> next year. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the agenda had not been set. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plans to fly immediately after the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> session to a meeting with the foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> Dec. 8-9. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed the meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> through Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>. The envoy delivered a note to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Sunday from Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. The president told reporters he anticipated `` a brief get-together'' with the Soviet leader. They have held four summits in the last three years and improved superpower relations. The principal achievement was the treaty <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed last December in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to abolish <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asked about seeing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> again, said `` that's not going to be anything in the nature of a summit meeting.'' He acknowledged, however, that he had `` no way of speculating'' what proposals the Soviet leader might offer. Other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the agenda would be worked out in diplomatic exchanges between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` Likewise, the nature of the meeting,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>. Before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, in October 1986, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had limited expectations of their agenda. But the two leaders proceeded to reach tentative judgments about wide-ranging reductions in their nuclear arsenals. The summit broke up in a disagreement over <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s anti-missile Strategic Defense Initiative. Asked if the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> meeting could develop the same way, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied: `` That depends on whether you are going by the public version of <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> or what actually happened there.'' He did not elaborate and reporters quizzing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> while he posed for pictures with visiting West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> went on to other questions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has already said he did not need a get-acquainted meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, having met him during the Soviet leader's visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The president-elect has said he would like to hold a summit meeting provided it held out promise of progress in any one of several areas, including arms control and human rights. But first, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, he would have <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, his choice for secretary of state, meet with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers. `` What I want to see is progress,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last Wednesday. `` I've never supported meetings just for the sake of having meetings.'' In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> described the meeting as part of `` a continuation of the U.S.-Soviet political dialogue that we believe should continue without artificial pause.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the main purpose from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standpoint was to `` ensure that the momentum and continuity of the arms control talks are extended and it will reaffirm the relationship between the general secretary and the new president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` I would not look to it as a meeting that would be settling things,'' he said. Several major issues in the U.S.-Soviet relationship are on the brink of resolution. These include a treaty that would reduce by 30 to 50 percent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines, and arrangements for the withdrawal of more than 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Also, the Soviets two weeks ago announced a suspension of their troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, while the two sides are maneuvering for position on a Soviet drive to hold a conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on human rights. Announcing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit, the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said he would travel also to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and set forth Soviet views on problems of world development in his speech to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> first met with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, in November 1985. They held their second summit in 1986 in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, then met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December and in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> May 29-June 2. At the end of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the two leaders had established so deep a relationship they could get together and discuss world problems `` without the necessity of a planned agreement,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> meeting, their last, `` will reflect that relationship.'' Moreover, the spokesman said, `` this brief meeting will help smooth the transition from president to president-elect. It will ensure that the moment and continuity of the arms control talks are extended. It will reaffirm the relations between the general secretary and the new president of the <LOCATION> united </LOCATION> <LOCATION> states </LOCATION> as we enter the decade of the'90s.''

 Federal investigators on Tuesday called for an immediate review of air traffic control procedures in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> after finding that a string of errors allowed a commuter plane to fly alarmingly close to <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One last month. The incident, which had been reported previously without detail, occurred Oct. 12 when Air Force One with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> aboard and a <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harbor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> commuter plane flew within 500 feet vertically and 1.5 miles horizontally as both planes were preparing to descend to <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> Standard separation for aircraft is 1,000 feet vertically and five miles horizontally. At the time of the incident, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials said the president was never in danger. But the incident prompted a broad investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> which said Tuesday that `` numerous managerial, operational and training deficiencies'' at four <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> facilities near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and near <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> were at fault. These errors reflected `` a serious lack of effective management and quality assurance,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>. It called on the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to conduct an independent investigation of air traffic control performance at the facilities involved similar to a probe recently concluded after a series of controller errors at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The board also said it was particularly concerned about its findings because the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> on a number of occasions dating back to l986 had investigated similar shortcomings at the facilities and indicated improvements had been made. `` The seriousness and magnitude of the problems ... justifies the highest level of <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> attention and action,'' the five board members said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said the agency would have no immediate comment on the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> findings. Among the findings that raised the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s concerns were: _ The controller at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> air traffic control center near <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who was handling the Bar Harbor plane, was never aware that Air Force One was in the same vicinity as the commuter in airspace between <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> _ A senior controller who was handling Air Force One was not clear on airspace boundaries and allowed <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One to penetrate the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> center airspace handled by the controllers near <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION> _ A directive to hold up traffic into <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> because of the impending arrival of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One was misunderstood because the message was not specific regarding which route Air Force One was using _ Two controllers who observed <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One and the commuter plane converging did not raise an alarm because they assumed there were plans already made to resolve the potential conflict _ An area supervisor involved indirectly in the incident was found to have been `` assigned to a position for which he was untrained and uncertified'' while another air traffic coordinator was given duties `` without receiving formal on-the-job training or a briefing on his responsibilities. The board said these and other shortcomings `` contributed directly or indirectly to this incident.'' As a result, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> said, a controller at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> air route center gave the <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> commuter pilot permission to descend from 11,000 feet to 7,000 feet, while another controller at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> air traffic control center cleared <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One to descend from 11,000 feet to 9,000 feet. Both planes were converging toward roughly the same area. The two planes were allowed to continue to converge until another controller noticed the two aircraft and directed the commuter to halt his descent at 10,000 feet and directed it away from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> aircraft, the safety board said. At one point, two other air traffic controllers, whose primary responsibility was to monitor traffic flow, `` realized there was a potential conflict when the radar targets, representing <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One and the commuter plane were about 10 miles apart and at about the same altitude,'' the investigators said. But the two controllers, who were not directly handling either of the planes, `` did not initiate a -LRB- warning -RRB- ... because they believed that some type of separation standard was going to be achieved.'' When the incident occurred, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was on a campaign trip on behalf of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He had spoken near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and was headed for <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> for another appearance. During the trip, officials advised reporters of the incident but provided no details and emphasized that <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One was never in danger of a collision. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president was not aware of the incident until later. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said that the pilot of Air Force One had been advised that the Bar Harbor commuter plane was nearby and no evasive action was required. Bar Harbor aircraft was flying as <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> Flight 3494 and carried 33 passengers and three crew members on a flight from <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Likud Asks Labor To Join Government As Junior Partner</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc asked the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday to join a coalition government as junior partner, but both sides indicated there were too many policy differences. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor, which leans to the left, spent four years as equal partners in a tenuous `` national unity'' coalition after indecisive elections in July 1984. In parliamentary elections Nov. 1, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won 40 seats in the 120-member <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> and Labor, led by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, got 39. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has been negotiating with small right-wing and religious parties. On Monday, President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> asked him to form a government. During a 90-minute meeting Tuesday, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said Labor could join a government under his leadership only if it dropped its insistence on an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> did not respond publicly to the demands, but <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said Labor ministers in the caretaker <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> opposed a coalition under such conditions. After two weeks of negotiations, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is in a position to form a majority coalition with four religious parties and three from the extreme right. His offer to Labor was seen as an attempt to avoid growing demands from those potential partners. `` I explained to Labor that the good of the country demands the establishment of a broad-based government, a government which would include the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and those parties that expressed a willingness to join a government under my leadership,'' the prime minister said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television. `` We have heard an invitation,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. `` Some things were more explicit, some things were more open-ended. We will discuss it and then decide.'' The 4-year-old coalition, in the first half of which <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> was prime minister and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> foreign minister, has been split on how to achieve peace with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations and end the 11-month-long Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> refuse to trade occupied land for peace, have called for increased military measures to end the <LOCATION> Palestiinian </LOCATION> revolt and oppose an international conference, which the Arabs demand. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are willing to exchange some of the occupied land for peace and favor an international conference. <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Modai </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> said: `` The question is do we have a common approach on basic issues. After glancing at <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s election platform, I would have to say no.''

 Brazilians voted Tuesday in municipal elections seen as popularity test for President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s government. Exit polls showed the government trailing badly, a television network said. At stake were mayoralties and city legislatures in 4,307 cities and towns in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s biggest country. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> has been widely blamed for the country's economic stagnation, inflation approaching 2,000 percent a year and a 40 percent drop in workers' buying power. Exit polls showed the government party leading in just six of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s 24 state capitals, according to <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globo </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest private network In 1985 mayoral and city council elections, the same party took 17 major cities. Pre-election polls showed <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s Brazilian <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ which in 1986 swept elections for state governors, state assemblies and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ will be fortunate if it wins even three mayorships in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s 14 largest cities. More than 75 million registered voters were to choose from 1.2 million candidates belonging to 29 parties, ranging from two communist groups to supporters of the former military regime. Lines at polling places were four city blocks long in many cities. Some results were expected late Tuesday, but officials said final results probably would not be announced until Sunday. Voting is mandatory, and Brazilians who do n't vote face trouble getting a passport, obtaining a government loan or a civil service job. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, the first civilian president since a 21-year military regime ended in 1985, called the elections a `` step toward democracy.'' `` Do n't think democracy is easy ... To be a democrat, it's necessary to renounce violence and convince by ideas and choose by the ballot,'' the president told a nationwide television audience Monday night But recent polls showed voter apathy and distrust of politicians were high. In <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>, many Brazilians took advantage of the national holiday and the warm weather to crowd the city's famous beaches, leaving voting for later. In recent weeks, a campaign begun by a satirical newspaper to `` elect'' a chimpanzee in the Rio Zoo as mayor has gained national attention as a sign of Brazilians' lack of confidence in politicians in general. Public service announcements on radio and television urged Brazilians not to throw away their votes by casting blank ballots or voting for nonsense candidates. Federal troops were stationed in 15 states and 271 municipalities to keep order. Police arrested some campaign workers for violating a law prohibiting last-minute campaigning within 300 feet of polling stations. The workers were trying to hand out sample ballots with their candidate's name written in. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> voted in his northern home state of <LOCATION> Maranhao </LOCATION>, then returned to the capital of <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, a 58-year-old politician and poet, gained office as the running mate of <PERSON> Tancredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Neves </PERSON>, who was chosen in a military-controlled electoral college vote. <PERSON> Neves </PERSON> died shortly before taking office. The elections are viewed as an important indicator of party popularity as <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> prepares for presidential elections in late 1989, the first such election in 29 years.

 A car smashed into a K mart department store Tuesday, killing one person and injuring 13, authorities said. A witness said that after the car had plowed through the store the driver tried to turn it around and drive back out. The car crashed through the front of the building and traveled about 100 feet into the crowded store, spraying glass and concrete and scattering employees and shoppers, said police Lt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Simonetti </PERSON>. `` I just saw everybody flying,'' said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, who was standing outside the store when the accident occurred. At least 12 people were struck before the automobile came to a stop. Ms. <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> said the driver of the late model <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dorado </ORGANIZATION> tried to drive out. The driver, 72-year-old <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION>, was questioned by police Tuesday evening and released. `` He stated he had a malfunction in the car,'' said <PERSON> Simonetti </PERSON>. `` The vehicle was impounded and will be given a safety and mechanical check tomorrow. No charges have been filed or are pending at this time.'' The dead woman was identified as <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanovick </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Nutley </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Simonetti </PERSON> said she was pronounced dead at the scene. Clothing, cameras and jewelry were strewn across the store, aisles were demolished and thick black skid marks were left on the linoleum floor. One woman, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, 65, was taken to <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> where a spokeswoman said she was in guarded condition.

All were in stable condition, with three of them suffering from leg and hip fractures and the rest from lacerations and bruises, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, district manager of the store chain, said there was no available estimate of how much damage was done. He said police would remain at the store to guard against looting.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced Tuesday that he was asking <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> to remain as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary, and a source said the president-elect also asked <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> to be his White House chief of staff. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, who is retiring as governor, had been one of two top candidates for the job, along with <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, who was chief of staff for nearly four years in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential office. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the announcement to keep <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> after meeting with German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, the first of a string of sessions the president-elect has scheduled with foreign leaders. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will meet Wednesday with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, and will confer with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> next month. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said Tuesday that his administration would work to reduce the budget deficit while resisting higher taxes and trade protectionism. His decision to keep <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, 58, in the Cabinet was expected. `` Our most important priority is to keep our economy growing with low inflation and he knows that we must resist the policies that will impede that effort, such as raising taxes or resorting to protection,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> `` knows we've got to sit down with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a deficit-reduction agreement and we've got to do it soon.'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a former investment banker and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s longtime friend, is the second person chosen for the new Cabinet. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week picked <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, his election campaign chairman, as secretary of state. An official announcement of <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s appointment was expected later. A source said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had decided on <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, whom he had invited to a private dinner Monday night at a vacation retreat in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and who flew back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> declined to talk about his future as he arrived back at the nation's capital. `` I'm still governor,'' said the 49-year-old conservative Republican, who was credited with helping <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> save a primary victory after the vice president lost <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> caucuses. `` I'll do whatever he needs.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, after talking with <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> and transition co-director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, said late Tuesday that she could not confirm the choice. Also mentioned as possible candidates for the post were <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, 37, co-director of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition office, and <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, the other co-director. Republican sources involved in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign and on the outside said Tuesday night that <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> would not want a White House post under <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. There has been widespread speculation that he might accept another post such as a Cabinet job. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> was promoted for the chief of staff job by conservatives who felt that he had more of an ideological edge than <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. `` I will make orderly announcements,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We're really just beginning to take a look at the Cabinet.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he informed <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of his choice of <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and that the West German Chancellor was pleased. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar has fallen sharply in relation to foreign currencies, including the West German mark. `` I'll do my best to help the president-elect, serve the people and to build on this, the longest recovery in the history of the country,'' said <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a former senator from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> who succeeded <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> last August. He had no comment on the fall of the dollar. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the announcement was not made particularly to calm world financial markets. But he added, `` I hope to the degree they need calming they will have that effect.'' He described <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a former co-chairman of the investment banking house of <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, as a man who `` brings to his office an extraordinary knowledge of financial markets, experience in the private sector.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s involvement in the presidential panel that studied the Oct. 19, 1987 stock market crash, as well as the <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> commission on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the Packard commission on <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> management. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> will sit down soon to focus on the savings and loan industry crisis, in which about 900 thrift institutions are either insolvent or ailing. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> says it may cost the government up to $ 50 billion to bail them out. The Bush-Kohl meeting took place at the vice president's official residence several miles from the White House. Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> sat in on the talks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he wants to forge close ties with the Western allies, and the discussions with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> raise the possibility of an early meeting with leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The president-elect has vowed to hold an early summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> but said he wants to see Soviet progress on issues such as arms control, human rights and regional conflicts. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has held four summits with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan to see him in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> next month, when the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader addresses the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Meantime, the rumor mill worked overtime on who might be appointed to top jobs in the next administration. The <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative think tank, planned to deliver 2,500 resumes to the transition office, hoping to place people with their views in jobs. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>, the transition's personnel director, is guiding the selection process for at least 5,000 political jobs Among those expected to round out <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s economic team are <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> as budget director and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>. New Jersey Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, who has been mentioned for a possible Cabinet post, spent the day here Tuesday, delivering a speech to a conservation group. His name has cropped up for possible secretary of transportation. Sources on Capitol <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign official <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> was a leading candidate to serve as chief congressional lobbyist. <PERSON> Loret </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruppe </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> director, has been touted as a possible secretary of health and human services, as has Rep. <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gradison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s name has surfaced He is a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> oilman who was the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign's finance director. Meanwhile, Rep.

 The General Assembly on Tuesday adopted a consensus resolution opposing outside interference in the Central American peace process. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> blamed <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for obstructing democracy in the region. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> urges the international community to adopt a realistic and honest appraisal of the disastrous effects of Nicaraguan mismanagement and repression upon the search for peace and democracy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> alternate representative to the world body. As it did last year, the assembly endorsed by consensus a resolution supporting the peace plan of five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries signed in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Aug. 7, 1987. The five who signed the plan, also known as <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION> II, are <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. But in a change from last year, the resolution said the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> `` appeals to the countries which are outside the region but which have links with it and interests in it to facilitate the implementation of the <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION> II accords and to abstain from any action which may impede such implementation.'' The reference appeared aimed at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which aides the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, as well as <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, both of which arm Salvadoran rebels. The peace plan prohibits foreign aid to rebels. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> told the assembly that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> shares the desire of the Central American peoples for democracy. But she said some `` troubling developments'' and anti-democratic trends in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> were not addressed in the resolution. One year ago, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said, the peace plan represented a mechanism for moving toward democracy. `` Now, we know that the promise is not yet fully realized and that one Central American country -LRB- <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> -RRB- has not lived up to its commitments,'' she said. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said that under the peace plan <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> promised a free press, freedom of assembly and free elections. `` It has delivered on none of these promises,'' she said. Nicaraguan elections have been postponed, the free press is in danger of extinction and political opposition leaders are in jail, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy said. She protested that the resolution calls for international economic cooperation `` despite the absence of any progress by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to grant the freedoms that are basic to building a healthy economy.'' But Nicaraguan Ambassador <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldera </PERSON> told the Assembly that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Contras was impeding democracy in the region and fulfillment of the peace plan. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was using `` pressure and manipulation of opposition groups ... in an effort to create internal chaos.'' This, he said, had been orchestrated by the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. He criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration which last week renewed its economic embargo against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. This embargo was declared illegal by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in June 1986, he said, and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has demanded its revocation since 1985. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> on Tuesday proposed that neutral observers be stationed along <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s borders with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrigal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON> made the suggestion during his address to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. He said stationing <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers would be `` a procedure of verification and control.'' The presence of thousands of Contras in camps in Honduran territory is one of the key obstacles to progress in the peace plan.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmacy </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday decided it would n't act on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s request that it stop distribution of a new `` smokeless cigarette. The <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is test marketing Premier cigarettes in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> filed a petition Nov. 2 seeking to have the product declared a new and hazardous drug, the distribution of which then would fall under the auspices of the pharmaceutical board. `` Our obligation is to protect the public health, so we feel that something needs to be done about this,'' said <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, president of the board. But the board `` will not in the morning make a decision that ` yes it is a drug' or ` no it is n't,' but we are working toward that,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said the board hopes to get more information from the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates distribution and marketing of drugs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and has more facilities and expertise that the state board. A petition the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> filed with the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> in April is pending. If the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> board later decides the cigarette is a drug, its options include seeking an injunction, such as the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> suggested in its petition. `` Also, they have the authority as -LRB- the -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> set forth in their position to seize misbranded drugs,'' said <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Agan </PERSON>, an assistant attorney general. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> law empowers the board to regulate drugs or hazardous substances sold in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, but it would have to file a lawsuit to enforce any regulation declaring a product a drug, <ORGANIZATION> Agan </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said in a news release that `` Premier is a cigarette ... not a drug-delivery system, as the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> has alleged.'' Its smoke, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said, `` substantially reduces many of the chemical compounds that the critics of smoking have been complaining about.'' The company also said at the time it found `` it difficult to understand how the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> can in good faith suggest that Premier be banned.'' Dr. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> assistant executive vice president, said the product contains nicotine, an `` addictive drug ... which has been implicated in cardiovascular disease.''

<HEAD>Damage From Hurricane Joan: $828 Million</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Tuesday said Hurricane Joan caused more than $ 828 million in damages to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, more than the amount of money spent fighting the U.S.-backed rebels. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also suspended the 30-day state of emergency enacted two days before <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> struck on Oct. 22. He called on workers, producers and political opposition groups to help reconstruction. Thousands of homes were destroyed, bridges collapsed and thousands of acres of crops were flooded. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said 137 people died in the hurricane and 119 people still were missing. He said almost 500,000 people were homeless. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the direct costs of the hurricane were more than $ 828 million. That figure did not include ecological damages, which he said still were incalculable. The leftist Sandinista government said in 1987 that direct costs of the civil war, which began in 1981, was $ 586.5 million. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> puts total war costs at more than $ 12 billion, including loans to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> blocked by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and projections of what Nicaraguan exports could have earned if not for the fighting. The president, in an 90-minute speech before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and foreign diplomats, called on Nicaraguan workers and producers to create a fund to aid rural peasants who suffered the worst damages in the hurricane. `` These peasants lost their homes, their work implements, their harvests,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. `` These peasants do n't have anything.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> lashed out at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for failing to offer emergency assistance but continuing to fund the rebels known as Contras. `` The only humanitarian aid the <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> government, the <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has approved is already known to us, that which they have approved for criminals, <ORGANIZATION> Somoza </ORGANIZATION> guards, to continue killing the people,'' he said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration began funding the Contras almost two years after the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> came to power in a 1979 revolutionary war that desposed the dictatorship of <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> claims <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is a communist beachhead in Central America. The Nicaraguan economy has suffered from the war, corruption and government mismanagement. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> pointed out that when the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> assumed power, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s economy already was reeling from the revolution and a powerful earthquake in 1972 that devastated <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the capital, and killed 10,000 people.

 More than 9,000 union members at <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> voted Tuesday to accept a three-year contract, averting a strike at the giant theme park. The six-union <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had rejected similar offers twice. Council president <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Totzke </PERSON> said the vote was 1,059 to 677 in favor of the agreement. `` I think they finally took a realistic look at the offer. I can say it now, it was a fair offer. We got all we could get.'' `` I'm obviously very happy about it,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> vice president for labor relations. `` We felt that we had a good contract.'' The new contract calls for raises of 50 cents an hour to workers now at top scale. They earn $ 6.80 an hour in the lowest pay grade to $ 9.70 an hour at the top grade. Workers below top scale would receive raises of 35 cents an hour. In April 1990, workers at top scale would get pay increases of 45 cents an hour, while those below top scale would receive 30 cents an hour more.

 <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinfeld </PERSON>, the high-energy exercise instructor and motivator has muscled into the `` infotainment'' TV market, but is playing what he calls that game's `` right field'' this season. You have to get up at 5:30 a.m. in most areas of the country to catch the 30-year-old <PERSON> Steinfeld </PERSON>'s `` Body By <PERSON> Jake </PERSON>,'' his entry in the crowded `` infotainment'' market. <PERSON> Steinfeld </PERSON> and show co-owner <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwyn </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> are hoping the show's format will put it ahead of other shows for advancement to better time slots. `` It's like saying, ` Put on a uniform. You're on the team, and you can play right field for now.' So I'm in the game now. A lot of balls are n't going to come to me, but I'm out here in right field.'' <PERSON> Steinfeld </PERSON>, a popular figure through his `` Fitness Breaks'' on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, three exercise videos, a book and coaching of such Hollywood luminaries as <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, said in a recent interview that he has been approached several times to do a television show. `` They've offered me to do exercise shows all over the place,'' <PERSON> Steinfeld </PERSON> said. `` The reason I refused was because I asked myself, ` Where is a show like that going to go? What are you going to say? Tune in tomorrow and I'll count to 60?''' The answer is a show that mixes exercise, tips, pep talks and unscripted chats with celebrity guests who talk about health or personal care. The syndicated show currently is in 115 markets, or about 86 percent of the country. `` The main thing is I do n't take myself seriously in the show,'' <PERSON> Steinfeld </PERSON> said. `` I do n't walk around saying ` well, this is how things are going to be done.' In the past, exercise people have done that and there's a stereotype of that, with them jumping up and down and screaming at people. `` The idea of the show is lifestyle. It's family. You do n't want to make health training and nutrition a second job,'' said <PERSON> Steinfeld </PERSON>, who peppers his language with invented words such as `` buttissmo'' for buttocks and `` abadab'' for abdominal muscles. The show has a seven-minute `` energizer'' exercise segment along with the tips and talk. But there's a twist. Instead of featuring a few good-looking models working out with <PERSON> Jake </PERSON>, the show has a shapely `` advanced'' workout model and a guest exerciser who is decidedly unfit. And that is the person <PERSON> Steinfeld </PERSON> and the camera give the most attention to. `` When you watch these shows, everyone looks gorgeous,'' <PERSON> Steinfeld </PERSON> said. `` Here we are in <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>. We're very jaded here Very jaded. It's a very vain community. Everybody seems gorgeous here, whether by naturalness or doctorness. `` But if you see a regular person working with <PERSON> Jake </PERSON>, you'll say, ` Hey, I can do that,'' he said. Brooklyn-born <PERSON> Steinfeld </PERSON>, whose often-repeated favorite slogan is `` Do n't quit,'' has described himself as a chubby teen-ager until his parents bought him a weightlifting set when he was 15. He spent only one year in college in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before deciding to move to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and become a bodybuilder. `` I was living the life of a musclehead, eating, sleeping and drinking bodybuilding ... sitting in the sun and bouncing at bars at night,'' <PERSON> Steinfeld </PERSON> recalled. `` I entered a Mr. Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> contest and came in second without using steroids. The guy who beat me was on the stuff and worked half as hard as I did and ate chocolate cake before the contest because he was taking thyroid and all this other stuff,'' <PERSON> Steinfeld </PERSON> said. He was disillusioned with bodybuilding after that. `` I'm not even close to that world anymore. I was mad. Here I was, a kid growing up and reading muscle magazines, and no one ever said anything about steroids. It made you think anyone could do it,'' he said. `` I just turned 30. When I was 20, nobody was talking about steroids. And now its finally out there as an issue.'' `` The best advice is do it naturally. You'll keep the weight you want, you'll keep your strength forever, and you'll feel a lot better about yourself,'' <PERSON> Steinfeld </PERSON> said.

 Recently freed from nearly two years as a hostage of Islamic fundamentalists in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, a university professor says some kind of religious conviction is necessary to make it through such an ordeal. `` You've got to have courage and faith in some absolute,'' says <PERSON> Mithileshwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, an India-born American resident dumped on a <LOCATION> Bierut </LOCATION> street Oct. 3 after 20 months of captivity. `` It was to what I know of God and of myself in relation to God that I had to turn in my 611 days,'' he said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, one of his first since his sudden, unexplained release. `` Everybody has an end to his strength. I was near the end of mine. The others -LRB- still held -RRB- must be coming near the end of theirs, too.'' For the last six weeks, he has been staying at a Presbyterian Church retreat center at <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, to `` collect myself, get well and get ready to go to work.'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 61, a business administration professor who has spent much of his career teaching in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but was teaching at <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> when kidnapped, said: `` In the beginning, your span of endurance is large, but as time goes on the span of time grows longer than the span of endurance. You become mentally exhausted, confused, listless.'' He said the he and three other hostages were kept together, usually in handcuffs, by the Islamic Jihad -LRB- Holy War -RRB- Organization for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. In the 20 months, he said they were moved six times to different locations, usually a room measuring about 10 by 12 feet, with food adequare, a bath allowed once a week. `` Our captors listened to our physical and medical needs but they did not listen to us as people,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said. `` To be a captive is to have nobody to rely upon to give meaning to what you are going through except for yourself. `` We had no meaning for the Jihad -LRB- kidnappers -RRB- as individuals, only as representative figures.'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a Hindu, said at one time to endure while `` very sick and weak,'' he reached back to his adolescence in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> when he once continuously chanted mantras -LRB- a repetitious prayer form -RRB- for a week. `` So now again, in the room I shared with the other captives, I turned to my mantra, wrapping my blanket over my head and chanting softly,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> relates. `` One million mantras I figure I said in that room. And as I said them I grew grateful for the experience, the chance, to do again at my age what I did in my youth.'' It was the `` process of saying the mantra, of thinking of God and of myself and the universe, that saved me, I think,'' he said. `` The point I am trying to make is that we as children, as adolescents, as young people should not try to live in a materialistic vacuum. `` We should develop our reservoirs of strength, of power, the deep moorings of the self to which we can turn and cling for safety in time of both adversity and prosperity. `` This ability comes out of a way of life, a lifestyle, and I am afraid _ oh I hope I am wrong _ that young people today are not building these moorings, not filling these reservoirs.'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who taught for l0 years at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> and for two years and at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>, said `` everybody, everywhere'' should press for release of the remaining captives. Nine Americans are among 14 foreigners still held being held prisoners in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said that during his captivity, he and three university colleagues kept with him _ <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Polhill </PERSON> _ worked on future plans and projects, all mentally, without pencil or paper. In one project, <PERSON> Singe </PERSON> said he worked in his head on how to solve challenges to education in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, each morning reviewing and critiquing his previous day's work, and in the afternoon advancing another step ahead. He said he now is eager to get to work on the two books he already has written in his mind. In the first two weeks of their captivity, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said Jihad leaders concentrated on interrogating the three, with `` vigorous attempts'' to get them to admit ties to American intlligence agencies. After that interlude, he said boredom became the rule, but at one point they were told they would be executed at midnight if Jihad demands were not met _ release of Palestinians held in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But the deadline hour passed. `` I would not say that I am bitter over what I went through,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said. `` Through meditation, the experience brought me its own rewards.''

 With the promise of legal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residency held before them, thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants are emerging from the shadows under which they harvested <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s fresh fruits and vegetables. In a last, desperate chance to become legal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents, many of these farmworkers are using fraudulent documents to prove they worked here before, thus qualifying for a legalization program that ends Nov. 30. The Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and organizations working to help the mostly <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> immigrants agree there is massive fraud. But the organizations say the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has developed a `` paranoia'' over the problem and has coerced applicants into signing `` confessions'' that their documents are phony. Immigration authorities deny the allegation. To qualify for legal residency under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, foreign farmhands must prove they harvested fruits, vegetables or other perishable crops in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for at least 90 days in a one-year period that ended May 1, 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> had estimated that 600,000 farm workers would apply. Instead, the figure topped 1 million by the first week of November, and up to 200,000 more are expected before the filing period ends Nov. 30, according to <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodin </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>' Special Agriculture Workers program. Under the initial phase of the legalization program, which ended May 4, temporary residency was granted to more than 1.7 million illegal aliens who proved continuous residency in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since Jan. 1, 1982. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> admits the service was ill-prepared with budget and staff because it underestimated the farmworkers' demand for legalization. To complicate matters, <PERSON> Bodin </PERSON> said, many of the farmhands were unable to obtain the documents they needed. So they turned to labor contractors who hire illegal immigrants, many of whom wrote letters to anyone who asked _ for a fee. `` Every time I call the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, they're screaming fraud, fraud, fraud,'' said <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Brigagliano </PERSON>, an attorney for the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> is going bonkers with this fraud stuff.'' `` The farmworkers are being penalized for fraud when we have created a wonderful black market here,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brigagliano </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, the California-based director of the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Farmworkers' Fund, said she received reports of people paying up to $ 800 for a phony letter, with the average about $ 300 <PERSON> Bodin </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> concern over fraud is not paranoia but suspicion that half the undecided cases that have reached processing centers may include phony papers. Nonetheless, he said, early statistics showed a 92 percent approval rate for the first 325,000 applications reaching the centers, where initial decisions are made. Rejections can be appealed to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Those qualifying for legalization under the 90-day prior work provision will receive temporary residency cards, which will be adjusted to permanent status in most cases on Dec. 1, 1990. The immigrants are not required to work in agriculture once admitted. The program also is available to those who can show they worked 90 days in each of three years that ended May 1, 1986, and have resided in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for at least six months for each of those years. They can become permanent residents earlier _ Dec. 1, 1989. The agricultural program was included in the 1986 law at the insistence of growers, especially in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, who argued they needed a pool of legal workers who could be ready to harvest perishable crops on short notice. `` The real test is yet to come,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, senior vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` It will be in the number of workers who remain working in agriculture.'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> suggested that those evaluating the program watch how many newly legalized workers show up to pick strawberries in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in January _ the first harvest after the deadline. But for thousands of farmhands seeking a better life, the test begins when they appear at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration office. `` They're being harassed, treated without dignity, told they will go to jail,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Farmworkers Fund <PERSON> Bodin </PERSON> described most INS personnel as `` cordial, friendly and trying to help'' but acknowledged their job was `` to determine the credibility of the applicant.'' He said farmworkers may find their interviews difficult because they're victims of `` the labor market they've been in.'' `` They were paid in cash, they rode around in a pickup truck, they might not know the names of the farms they worked, only the crew leader's first name,'' he said. `` We try to talk to the applicant and try to get a sense of his credibility. We have gone the last mile. But we can not simply take peoples' word for it. The statute and the regulations require documentary evidence.''

 When <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> named its miniseries about the revolution in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> `` A Dangerous Life,'' it was n't supposed to describe the filming `` When I got to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> they gave me a three-page form to fill out with very personal information to use in negotiations in case I was abducted,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Busey </PERSON>, who stars as a journalist in the three-part, six-hour film airing on Home Box Office this Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. `` A Dangerous Life,'' as seen through the eyes of a reporter, tells of the 1986 `` people's revolution'' that brought down the government of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and brought <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power as president. During his 5 -LCB- - week stay in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> was accompanied by four bodyguards and three trucks Even so, <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> and the film company were forced to leave the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> on short notice after <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, the former Minister of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, obtained a court order halting production, citing invasion of privacy. Another prominent military officer also filed suit. `` All the judges of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> were out of town,'' said <PERSON> Busey </PERSON>. `` They gave us six hours to get out. We left under armed guard. We went to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> for the interiors then to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to finish the exterior scenes. We finally won the case, but it took months to come to trial.'' <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> stars as <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on assignment when he witnesses the assassination of opposition leader <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s husband. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' right-hand man, Gen. <PERSON> Fabian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ver </PERSON>, is accused in the murder, but his acquittal spurs <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to challenge <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in the presidential election. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> wins the election amid charges of fraud. Most of the military sides with <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is forced to flee. The miniseries also stars <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilling </PERSON> as <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s estranged wife, a fellow journalist; <PERSON> Tessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> as <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>; <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Rustia </PERSON> as <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>; <PERSON> Laurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillen </PERSON> as <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Joonee </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamboa </PERSON> as <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>. A number of Filipino actors appear in the miniseries, <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> said. `` They were magnificent. They came prepared, they were very disciplined. The focus of the series is a story about their country, which was very important to them. <PERSON> Tessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, used to do a one-woman show on her. <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> loved it. These are actors who are playing people who are still alive who have the ability to get back at them. `` Some members of the cast were pro-Marcos and some were pro-Aquino. We had a lot of tension. My character is a man who gets caught up in the passion of the revolution. I talked to correspondents who covered it. They were very emotional about it. They stayed with the rebel troops. That's where the story was. `` I thought this was going to be easy, but it was like two lifetimes doing this. I learned an awful lot. It was a rewarding experience. I learned a lot about human nature and how democracy works in a Third World country.'' <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> talked about the film on a break from the theatrical feature `` Hider in the House.'' He was in his trailer watching the soap opera `` As the World Turns'' while on location in <LOCATION> Duarte </LOCATION>, about 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` I've been watching this for 25 years,'' he said. `` When I go to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> I visit with these guys. I started watching when I was in college in <LOCATION> Coffeyville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. It's got everything _ sex, blackmail, revenge. It's a great mental catharsis for an actor.'' In `` Hider in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> plays a demented man who takes up residence in the attic of a house being remodeled. The film company was working at the site of an old house that was due to be remodeled. The movie also stars <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McKean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>.

 As Air Force One began its descent into <ORGANIZATION> Carswell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> glanced down through the darkness. Amber lights silhouetted the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> skyline and gave the city a friendly, festive glow. `` Spectacular,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> told Congressman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. The date was Nov. 21, 1963, and the presidential party had flown to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> for the third stop on a whirlwind tour designed to end the left-right squabbling among bitterly factionalized <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrats and secure the state for the presidential election the following year. A crowd estimated at 6,000 greeted <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON>, at <PERSON> Carswell </PERSON>, and thousands more lined the motorcade route to the old <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where the president would spend his final night. A 26-year-old AP reporter caught his first glimpse of an American president that evening and, in that era of innocence, was every bit as excited as a small-town West Texan should have been. Hours later, that <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> reporter joined other numbed and dismayed colleagues in covering the death of his president and the wounding of Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connally </PERSON>. Just days later, he covered the slaying of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> and, drafted for the task, helped carry his body to its grave. Then came the 1964 murder trial of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>, the Ides of March conviction, a death sentence and an appellate court ruling that set the verdict aside. <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> died of cancer before he could be retried. Through the years, there were interludes with <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Marina </PERSON>, and turbulent, intriguing bouts with his mother, <PERSON> Marguerite </PERSON>, whose favorite pastime was haranguing <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> reporters. And always the conspiracy buffs, the researchers dedicated to proving the <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s basic conclusion a lie, and not a very convincing one at that. They insisted <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> was not the killer or, at the very least, was not the sole triggerman. In 1981, the conspiracies peaked with a trip to <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cemetery </PERSON> to dig up the body buried 18 years before in <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>'s grave A British author had claimed we had buried an impostor, a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> spy in fact. He was wrong. Forensic tests at <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> proved it was indeed <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>. Although the echoes of gunfire in <LOCATION> Dealey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION> grow fainter with each passing autumn, the events of November 1963 continue to touch us all in mystifying ways and to different degrees. This month, there will be network and cable documentaries, new books, an all-night Capitol vigil and memorials by former <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> volunteers and PT boat veterans. Millions of words will be written. Still, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family members would prefer that remembrances of the slain president be changed. `` They have tried to get away from commemorating the day of his death and try to celebrate the day of his birth,'' says <PERSON> Melody </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, an aide to Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. What is the significance of this 25th anniversary and the anniversaries that preceded it? Do we know the legacy of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>? Or the lessons of 1963? Historians may one day pinpoint all this and more. But do n't bet on it.

 Anyone old enough to read or watch television 25 years ago can recite from memory the events of November 22. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> spoke twice in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> that morning, first to a crowd of 5,000 who had gathered in the rain in the hotel parking lot. Vice President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Connally </PERSON> joined him, but <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> did not. `` It takes a little longer to put herself together, that's why she's prettier than we are,'' the president joked with the cheering crowd. Inside, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> addressed a sold-out <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> breakfast in the hotel's Grand Ballroom. That group totaled 2,050, with 50 extra tickets allotted at the last minute to the black community. No blacks, no breakfast speech, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said when told the president would be addressing an all-white audience. It was <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s final speech, but <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> stole the show, looking lovely and self-assured in a two-piece pink suit with matching pillbox hat. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and his entourage then returned to <PERSON> Carswell </PERSON> for the short flight to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, where the president was to address a luncheon at the Trade Mart. In <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, 200,000 people, many on lunch breaks, jammed the streets to see the 46-year-old president and his 34-year-old wife. Smiling and waving, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> sat at her husband's side as the motorcade rolled through the canyons of downtown <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Delighted and relieved by the big, friendly reception, <PERSON> Nellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Connally </PERSON>, the governor's wife, turned from her seat in front of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and said: `` No one can say <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> does n't love and respect you, Mr. President.'' `` You sure ca n't,'' he replied. Seconds later, the motorcade passed in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depository </ORGANIZATION> and into a sniper's cross hairs.

 The first year after the assassination was difficult for most Americans. It was a nightmare for Texans, particularly those living in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. A number of publications found much to dislike about <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and most were mightily concerned with the so-called `` mood of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' and the accommodation granted its far-right fanatics in the conservative mainstream. In an editorial headlined `` A Year Later,'' the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Morning News touched on the `` scathing and unjust criticism'' of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and observed how the city stood alone `` in the spotlight of unfavorable conspicuousness.'' The editorial did not mention the small but noisy element of right-wingers whose agitation had prompted <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s visit 12 months before. Perhaps it was unimportant. What seemed to matter to the newspaper was that hysteria and shock had subsided and the city could move ahead with new resolve and high purpose. November 22 that year fell on a Sunday, and a still sorrowful nation remembered <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in prayers and memorial services across the country. It had been a year of memorials. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Space Flight Center at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, was renamed <PERSON> Cape </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, but later was changed back. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> changed the name of its international airport from <LOCATION> Idlewild </LOCATION> to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Congress authorized construction of a cultural center in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to be named in <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>'s honor, and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> announced plans for a Kennedy Memorial Library. By the end of the year, it seemed certain that more American streets, avenues and boulevards would be named <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> than Main.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of the assassination was so brief and simple it almost slipped past unnoticed. Fifty people gathered for the prayer service near the spot where <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was slain. A city official laid a wreath of red and white carnations beside the bronze marker that tells the assassination story. The news was dominated by the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war and the 1968 election. Pain still lingered from the slayings earlier that year of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.

<HEAD>DALLAS: Robert F. Kennedy.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 By the 10th anniversary in 1973, reporters were getting lathered up over Watergate. In <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, 500 people gathered near the assassination site, but the top news story of the day was an 18-minute gap in a Nixon White House tape recording. The JFK focus in 1973 was shifting to conspiracy theories, fed by books and a movie called `` Executive Action'' that laid blame for the Kennedy killing on a group of greedy <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilmen. `` There's nothing new. My view is the same _ <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> did all the shooting,'' retired district attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> said in an interview last month. `` I have n't seen anything to change my mind. I feel like somebody might have planted the seed or thought that somebody ought to kill him -LRB- <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> -RRB- while in town. But there is absolutely no proof of anything like that.'' Fifteen years ago, <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, who would have prosecuted <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> had he lived, was less certain. `` I find it hard to believe that <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> did n't have help,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in 1973. `` Call it a gut feeling on my part. I do n't have any evidence to back it up But I believe there was a conspiracy. You just do n't go downtown one morning and kill the president.'' The widow of J.D. <PERSON> Tippit </PERSON>, the police officer <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> shot after fleeing the school book warehouse, had remarried by the 10th anniversary. A lawyer said the $ 600,000 she received from a sympathetic public after <PERSON> Tippit </PERSON>'s death went into a trust for their three children.

 Unlike the spartan fifth anniversary, the landmark 20th touched all bases. Movies, television specials, documentaries, books, magazine articles and news stories explored the assassination anew. In 1963, <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>, at age 22, was a stranger in a foreign land, a frightened young woman with few friends, no money, no job, no future, two infant daughters and a dead husband accused of killing the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It was horrible,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> 20 years later. `` For a while I thought it would all blow over, just go away. But now I accept the fact that I must live with this for the rest of my life.'' Less than two years after the assassination, <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> married <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, a carpenter, and they moved to a country house north of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. She was then and remains today uncertain of <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>'s guilt and whether he acted alone. She initially agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> was the lone assassin, but doubts crept in and she later changed her mind. But, she told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, `` I do n't have any desire to waste the rest of my life trying to prove something that can not be proven.'' There are those, however, who are obsessed with doing precisely that. In 1983, an AP story first pulled together theories about the <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Dog </PERSON> <PERSON> Man </PERSON>, the Umbrella Man, the Mafia Con Man, the Tall Tramp and a man called Frenchy. The article also looked at publications called `` The Continuing Inquiry,'' `` Coverups!'' and `` Echoes of Conspiracy.'' Those are names and newsletters well-known to the self-described `` theorists'' or `` critics'' who claim there is a sinister and still secret story behind the assassination. They raise provocative questions but provide few answers. That brings us to the 25th anniversary and the latest theories. A British television documentary entitled `` The Men Who Killed <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' broadcast Oct. 25, claimed three gangsters from <LOCATION> Marseilles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, assassinated <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> on orders from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> organized crime. The two-hour documentary on Central Television identified the purported assassins by name and said one was shot to death in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 1972, a second was working in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s drug trade and the third was living in <LOCATION> Marseilles </LOCATION> after his recent release from prison. But the day after the program aired, a <LOCATION> Marseilles </LOCATION> newspaper assembled records indicating that two of them could not have been in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> on Nov. 22, 1963; one was serving on a minesweeper from Oct. 16, 1962, to April 16, 1964, according to <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> navy headquarters, and another was in a <LOCATION> Marseilles </LOCATION> jail cell that day, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, the newspaper account quoted the navy veteran as saying that the third man singled out was also in jail on the day of the assassination. The program was based on a four-year inquiry by American writer and researcher <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivele </PERSON> and the program's British director, <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. In this country, a syndicated television report is reviving the theory that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination was an act of revenge by <LOCATION> Lousiana </LOCATION> mob boss <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON>, who was deported in 1961 by then-U.S. Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The program, presented by reporter <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwitny </PERSON>, was broadcast in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Nov. 1 and will air elsewhere this month. The report said evidence indicated that <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> had connections to Marcello: <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> through his uncle, who purportedly worked for the <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> organization, and <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> through drug trafficking, which would have been controlled by <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON>. In a two-hour television special Nov. 2, columnist <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> argued another theory involving the Mafia, that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was a victim of underworld figures first hired by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to kill <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s special says <ORGANIZATION> Santo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trafficante </ORGANIZATION>, mob boss in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> before <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> took power in 1959, double-crossed the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and informed <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> then made a deal with <PERSON> Trafficante </PERSON> to kill <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> theorized. <PERSON> Trafficante </PERSON> allegedly enlisted the suppport of two other bosses, <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Giancana </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> was set up as the fall guy. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s special also linked Ruby to the Mafia plot.

 Back when the echoes of gunfire were still ringing in <LOCATION> Dealey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION>, the media struggled to define the mood of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and how the city's right-wing tolerance might have figured in the assassination. They apparently failed. D Magazine, a slick <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> monthly, unveiled its November 1988 issue with this cover: `` 25 Years Later: Did <PERSON> Dallas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>?'' Inside, there is a story entitled `` Was <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> a City of Hate?'' The debate goes on. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> bureau chief who directed the news agency's assassination coverage, wrote the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s first startling words: `` BULLETIN `` <LOCATION> DALLAS </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was shot today just as his motorcade left downtown <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> jumped up and grabbed Mr. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. She cried, ` Oh, no!' The motorcade sped on.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, recently retired and living in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, remained in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for six years after the shootings. Never once, he said, did he drive past the book depository without getting a `` prickly feeling'' on the back of his neck. `` I still feel it,'' he said after a visit to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> this year. `` The event has got some kind of hold on Americans ... and many foreigners as well. It's hard to explain.'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Womble </PERSON> can not explain it either. But she vividly remembers the look on her fifth-grade teacher's face when he dismissed his pupils in <LOCATION> Chicopee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, that November afternoon. `` Just by his expression, we knew something really big had happened,'' she says now. Ms. <PERSON> Womble </PERSON>, 35, now director of marketing at upscale <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> shopping complex in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said the whole issue is muddled because the case has never been solved. `` But to me, the way to work out our emotions of guilt and regret is to discuss them openly and repeatedly,'' she said. `` They just do n't vanish.''

 Americans rank <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> as the nation's greatest president, remembering him with a striking sense of loss a quarter-century after his assassination, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll has found But <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s exalted place in history rests more on his potential and his personal qualities than on his accomplishments in office. In the national survey he was rated far higher on charisma than on other attributes. Slightly more than one-fifth of the 1,125 adults surveyed picked <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> as the greatest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president, more than named any other. Only <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> came close in popularity. Among all respondents, a plurality rated <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> as a good president, not a great one. Still, a majority said they believed that had he lived and served a second term, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be a better place today. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, at 43 the youngest president elected, served nearly three years before he was shot and killed in a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> motorcade Nov. 22, 1963. Twenty-five years later, his name is invoked and his words are quoted by politicians seeking to assume his mantle of popularity. In more recent years, the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> image crumbled a bit with reports of extramarital affairs and of meetings with a Mafia boss. In the survey, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s judgment was rated lower than other qualities. Most striking, however, was the depth of feeling associated with the slain president. More than six in 10 respondents said they still felt a personal loss from <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>'s assassination, including many who were children or were not yet born in 1963. Among his contemporaries, seven in 10 feel a loss. In another gauge, the poll asked if respondents remembered where they were when they heard <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had been killed. Of those 30 and older now _ meaning they were at least 5 years old then _ more than 90 percent said yes. To order the pantheon of presidents, the survey asked: `` Who do you think was the greatest American president?'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was named by 21 percent; <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, 17 percent each; <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, 7 percent each. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has led similar lists in other polls over the years. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was most popular with 30 - to 44-year-olds, who were children or teen-agers when he served; nearly a third of them called him the greatest president In other ratings as well, that group viewed <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> especially favorably. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who moved to enforce civil rights laws in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, also was rated particularly highly by blacks. Eight in 10 felt a personal loss from his death, and 60 percent of blacks called him a great president, compared to 31 percent of whites. Overall, a third of respondents said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was a great president and 40 percent said a good one. He did better with Democrats and the less-educated, and as the first Roman Catholic president, he was rated highly by <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> also was more popular with liberals, but his standing to a great degree transcended ideology. He achieved his high ratings even though 40 percent identified him as a liberal, while only 15 percent identified themselves as liberals. To gauge the components of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s image, the poll took measures _ excellent, good, fair or poor _ of his accomplishments as president, his potential for accomplishments had he not been assassinated, and his leadership, judgment and charisma. Although he was rated highly in all categories, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> drew far and away the best ratings for his charisma _ 60 percent excellent. Next were his leadership and his potential, both rated excellent by 39 percent. But <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s excellent ratings fell off on his accomplishments and his judgment: In both, about two in 10 said excellent. Half said good, but in his only sizable negative scores, more than a fifth rated him just fair in both categories. There was a partisan aspect to many of the ratings. Fifty-two percent overall said the nation would be a better place had <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> lived and served a second term; that included 68 percent of the Democrats polled, compared to 34 percent of the Republicans. Doubts emerged on the specific issue of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. About a third said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> would have prevented the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from becoming deeply involved in the fighting there, but 44 percent said not. The rest did n't know. The survey found considerable familiarity with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>; more than half the respondents 30 and over said they knew a great deal about him. But such awareness waned among younger adults: Of those 18-29, only 25 percent shared that sense of familiarity with the former president. The poll, conducted Sept. 6-14, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 This <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Sept. 6-14 with 1,125 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Each phone number was selected randomly by computer, and the interviews was conducted with the adult who'd had the most recent birthday. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically would be within plus or minus three points of the poll's results, 19 times out of 20. The margin of error is higher for subgroups _ 5 points, for example, for Democrats. Other sources of potential error in polls include the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and responses in this poll; because of rounding, some may not total exactly 100: 1.

 In the rugged <LOCATION> Rogue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> of southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, the few people who had contact with <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehrer </PERSON> knew him as a man of few words. But when President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was assassinated, <PERSON> Lehrer </PERSON> took a pen and with a trembling hand but strong heart wrote a rare letter, to the first lady. `` I am just an old man living by myself way up in the mountains,'' he wrote. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was the best president we ever had and you are the most wonderful woman in the world. Anyone -LRB- tries -RRB- to tell me different has me to whip. Twin fawns come in my yard to eat feed I put out for them. One's name is <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> the other <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Lehrer </PERSON>'s letter is now in a special file at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>, created by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> from condolences sent to <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Most of the 300,000 pages of letters, selected from about 3 million pages, are still being catalogued. But the couple hundred already on file reveal, in simple, touching and rarely mawkish prose, how deeply personal the Kennedy presidency and passing was for average Americans. There are letters from heads of state and celebrities, but most are from the likes of a self-proclaimed `` nobody'' housewife from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; from a retarded boy in <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who labored for an hour to print his 45 words; from a woman from <LOCATION> Ripley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, who said that because of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> many Southerners no longer accept an old saying that `` a child born of a black mama and a black papa, his days will always be unhappy.'' The most frequent reflections are on JFK's vigor and humor, his efforts on behalf of the mentally handicapped and minorities, and his handling of the Cuban missile crisis. Some letters note special personal connections: <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Cagle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, for instance, whose life sentence <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> commuted three days before the assassination, and a crippled woman from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> whom <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> once gave a ride when he spotted her struggling to keep up with marchers in a parade in his honor. Several of the dozen letter writers contacted 25 years later had only vague recollections of what they had written Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. But memories of the assassination and the president were strong and little changed. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dills </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, had written at the age of 12 to Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>: `` When I heard your husband's speech that fatal morning I was glowing with pride because of the nice things he said about Texans. But now I am ashamed that I am a Texan. I wish I was not one.'' <PERSON> Dills </PERSON> is now a pediatric nurse who's back in love with her home state but unremitting in her devotion to a president and a period she believes `` was the last time people really felt proud.'' She recalled getting the news of the assassination while in physical education class. She cried. `` And then I remember a girl saying ` Good,' and -LRB- my -RRB- turning around and busting her one.'' <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, wrote as a high school senior that she was `` a bigot'' until <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> inspired her with his civil rights stands and other programs. And the riveting media attention given the assassination helped steer her to a career in communications. Now, as a producer and writer for a commercial film company in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, she says `` this current <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> scene is a very cruel comparison to what that was. ... We're all waiting for something like him to come back ... some part of us that feels if the right person would step out we'd have Camelot again.'' <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chetwynd </PERSON> of Melrose, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, `` This country simply turned around and got lousy when the both of them went,'' referring to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>. Her condolences to the first lady included an account of her mother, a polio victim, once being given a ride by <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` It was the highlight of her life. She clipped and cut out everything in the papers about him. It was like he was her own boy.'' The letters to Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> often include notes like `` you'll probably never see this. But she read thousands of them, and notations on some indicate that `` JBK'' found this one or that one especially touching. In fact, it was Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> who promised almost 25 years ago that such a file, expected to be completed and available to researchers next year, would be created. She inspired many of the letters. Actor <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, for example, wrote the day after Christmas 1963 that her courage had helped him and his wife when they lost a son nine days earlier. The letters also shared with her glimpses of the backyard tributes that went on around <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Mrs. G.W. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, wrote how her 14-year-old son returned to a tree house he had long since outgrown. He raised a flag from a halyard there. `` And every morning in the cold dawn before school he raised it, lowered it to half staff, and in the chill afternoon quietly took it down.'' <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Biever </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nappanee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, wrote that `` our neighbor children named our favorite shortcut path <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION>. We christened it and everything.'' A quarter of a century later, and now <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ludington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, she had little memory of the event, but she believes <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> `` was an influence in many of the major things of my life, such as being active and aware politically.'' At <ORGANIZATION> Peninsula </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Gig </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, teacher <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Crook </PERSON> wrote, `` The news came just before I was due to teach <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON>'s ` Ode to a Skylark.' -LRB- You were at the hospital. -RRB- Numb, cold, choked, I put it to the class: ` What do you do? Go home?' There was silence, and no face registered anything at all. Then a boy, very quietly, without waiting for recognition, said, ` No, we're Americans Let's do the work we have to do.''' An Indian chief from <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, offered his sympathy and then said he had asked the great spirit of his people to provide `` plenty of soft spruce boughs for his rest at night.'' He also said that from now on, `` the gentle breeze will be his touch, the rippling of running water his smile, and the song of birds his voice.'' A few letters were sent to people in the administration. Reclusive author <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON> sent a telegram to presidential press secretary <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON>, no relation: `` My wife and I simply ache for an effectual way to send Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and the children our love and to say that we would be inexpressibly grateful for a way to be of some comfort or use to them. Surely everyone in the world must be heartbroken tonight.'' Some of the letters were just dropped off at the gravesite. One signed by `` Just Another American'' concluded, `` Good-bye my chief, my leader, my captain. Good-bye, my president. Good-bye.''

Snow tires on sale were $ 10.22, wheel balancing and mounting free. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Palooka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and The <ORGANIZATION> Pirates </ORGANIZATION> were in the funnies and so was Pogo. Condoms were sold in gas station restroom vending machines or from under the counter in drug stores. Boys still blushed when they asked for them. Tempus fugit. Time flies. It stood still that day in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> when <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was killed. But the world that he knew _ and that knew him _ is a different world today. Then, it cost $ 950 to send a kid to a state college, $ 1,907 to a private school _ room, board and tuition. Now those figures are $ 4,445 and $ 11,330. <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s day is <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. Southern <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' 113 member states have grown to 159, the world's population from 3.2 billion to more than 5 billion, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s from 189 million to 244 million. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, then an outcast, a technological pygmy, now bids to launch American satellites. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which rattled the nuclear saber and blustered `` we will bury you'' in <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>'s time, is working with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to reduce the number of horrible weapons. At the time of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s Cuban missile crisis, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had 5,000 nuclear weapons, the Soviets only 300. Now each country has over 25,000. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> revived Depression-era food stamps as a pilot program; now 19 million people use them. The number of farms in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has fallen by more than 1 million, to fewer than 2.2 million. Baseball's major leagues crossed the border to embrace <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> got into the majors and so have <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, halfway between <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, home of <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION>. The nation's game, however, is no longer played professionally in the nation's capital. If you were shopping for early Christmas presents in 1963 you could choose from wood tennis rackets, home movie projectors, portable typewriters, most of which can still be gotten but who needs them in the days of graphite rackets, camcorders and laptop computers? You could n't buy a telephone then; you can now. When people talked about using `` calculators,'' they meant slide rules or adding machines. You could take the SS <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, buy a <ORGANIZATION> VW </ORGANIZATION> bug, which everyone thought would be around forever. Cars from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>? Do n't be silly. In 1963, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicklaus </PERSON> became the second golfer ever to make $ 100,000 _ <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, of course, was the first. But that was before television invented Sunday afternoons. Last year <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Strange </PERSON> set the record for a single season, winning $ 925,941. <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> priests were dousing themselves with gasoline and setting themselves afire in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had sent in 16,000 advisers, the advance contingent for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s longest and most controversial war that saw 543,400 troops there at the high point. More than 58,000 young Americans lost their lives. People have become famous who were n't born yet or were pre-schoolers when <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was killed. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, the actor; <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, the presidential daughter; <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Canseco </PERSON>, the World Series ballplayer; <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, the heavyweight champion; <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, the runner; <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Louganis </PERSON>, the diver. Among the teen-agers of that day, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Jobs </PERSON>, the computer whiz; <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, the senator; <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the vice presidential nominee. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s federal budget proposal for 1964 envisioned spending $ 98.8 billion, a record, with $ 11.9 billion in red ink. The deficit built into in <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1989 proposal _ $ 129.5 billion _ is more than the entire <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> budget. The debt ceiling was $ 315 billion. It is now _ hold your breath _ $ 2.8 trillion. That's 2,800 billion dollars. Or: $ 2,800,000,000,000. <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> reported a net 1962 loss of $ 14,895,365. What's changed there In 1987, the airline lost $ 181.7 million. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> had earnings of $ 84 million; now, as <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, its earnings are $ 4.84 billion. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Haworth </PERSON> has left the advice column field to <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abby </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> <PERSON> Rambler </PERSON> has gone the way of the Studebaker, the DeSoto and the dodo bird, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> population has moved inexorably west and south, so that between 1960 and 1980 its center moved from 6 -LCB- miles northwest of <LOCATION> Centralia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, to one-quarter mile west of DeSoto in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. Lunch counters were still closed to blacks when <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was in the White House. To vote in most of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, one had to pay a poll tax. Drinking fountains were labeled `` white'' and `` colored.'' In 1988, 6,829 elected officials across the nation are black, including 301 mayors and 429 judges of state courts. In 43 states, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s birthday is a holiday. Only two of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s time, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, still sit on the bench. And eight men who were serving in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> still are there, including <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s youngest brother, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> Around the world, a handful of national leaders who were in power in <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>'s time remain. <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il-Sung </PERSON> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is gone, but his son is in the House of Representatives. JFK's son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who saluted bravely as his father's coffin passed, is a strapping, handsome 28-year-old. In 1963, 77 percent of American homes had television sets; 98 percent do today. And three out of four homes had telephones; now 93 out of 100 homes have them. More than half of all homes have video cassette recorders, which were virtually unknown then. Radios have multiplied: 156 million in 1963 and 530 million now. There is no change in older folks' complaints about the younger generation's taste in music <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had committed the nation to going to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> in the decade of the'60s, and it did, but when he died only six Americans had gone into space. Since then, 12 Americans have walked on the moon and, in all, 208 astronauts have been aboard 57 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space flights. The Soviets have sent 138 cosmonauts on 65 flights. They have female astronauts, and so have we. In 1963, there was no transplanting of hearts, but there was cocky confidence that virtually any infection could be controlled with antibiotics and chemicals. That was before toxic shock syndrome, <ORGANIZATION> Legionnaire </ORGANIZATION>'s disease and now, the dread AIDS. Tempus fugit. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s beautiful young wife is a grandmother. The world has changed. The torch, as he said, has passed.

 In fairy tales, the beautiful princess marries the handsome prince and they live happily ever after. But <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouvier </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>' fairy tale short-circuited on a warm day in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> when her pink suit was splattered with her prince's blood. In the ensuing 25 years, she has had to write her own happy ending. The plot twists she has chosen have not been popular with the adoring multitudes who would have preferred that she remain the national widow. Her 1968 marriage to Greek shipping tycoon <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> engendered outrage, and her penchant for privacy has bred some resentment. But once a year, she kneels alone at Arlington National Cemetery. And once again she becomes the stoic, black-veiled widow who stood at that spot in November 1963 to bury her husband, President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` One must not let oneself be overwhelmed by sadness,'' she once said.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 It is important to remember what <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and to the world. She was the glamorous, whispery-voiced brunette whose appearances caused as much commotion as her husband's _ so much so that he laughingly introduced himself as <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>'s escort. She was the fashion plate whose designer dresses, pillbox hats and white gloves spurred the fashion industry as much as her hatless husband wounded the fedora trade. `` We are on the threshold of a new American elegance thanks to Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s beauty, naturalness, understatement, exposure and symbolism,'' said <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassini </PERSON>, her official designer. She was the young hostess of a televised tour of the White House, the graduate of Miss <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s School and <ORGANIZATION> Vassar </ORGANIZATION> who said her prime responsibility was to `` take care of the president so he can best serve the people.'' She was 34 years old when <PERSON> JFK </PERSON> died, a striking contrast to her matronly predecessors, <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. Most of all, she was mistress of Camelot.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 She forfeited that title when she married <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, the aging Greek who seemed the antithesis of the elegant <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Many said she was a golddigger; she never explained the marriage publicly, never responded to such headlines as `` Jackie: How Could You?'' `` She, by surviving and being with him -LRB- JFK -RRB- when he died so dramatically, became a legend in her own lifetime,'' said a friend, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON>. `` And she can not live up to it because no human being could.'' The marriage foundered quickly, and <PERSON> Ari </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> lived separate lives. When he died in 1975, he left her $ 120,000 in his will; she won a $ 26 million settlement from the <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> family. At the same time, stories about JFK's escapades while he was president began to spread _ stories about alleged liaisons with <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> and the mistress of mobster <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Giancana </PERSON>. And others suggested that JFK's most lasting legacy was the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Camelot was n't what it used to be.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 With her millions, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> could have done absolutely nothing, enjoying her 14-room apartment on upper Fifth Avenue, her estate in <LOCATION> Bernardsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and the oceanfront compound on <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard while raising her two children, <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. Instead, she entered the job force in 1978 as an editor for <ORGANIZATION> Doubleday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. She works there 3 -LCB- days a week _ producing ideas and acquiring books from authors and agents, then guiding the writing of manuscripts Her primary publishing interests are art and entertainment, never politics. Her bestsellers have included <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s autobiography, `` Moonwalk,'' and ballerina <PERSON> Gelsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>'s `` Dancing on My Grave `` I think people who work themselves have respect for the work of others,'' she has said. Her salary, reportedly $ 40,000-50 ,000 a year, is a pittance of her net worth _ estimated at around $ 50 million, plus $ 200,000 a year from a trust fund bequeathed by <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> She has made some public appearances in recent years. She has supported efforts to save city landmarks like Grand Central Terminal, attending news conferences but saying little and slipping out through freight entrances. On her infrequent appearances at social galas, she often dons the designs of <PERSON> Carolina </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>. Her date is usually longtime friend <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON>, 58, a Belgian-born diamond dealer and international businessman. On autumn weekends, Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> sometimes rides with the <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, near her <LOCATION> Bernardsville </LOCATION> estate. She often is among the spectators at the annual steeplechase in nearby <LOCATION> Peapack </LOCATION>; she does not mingle with the locals. She has been seen sailing and waterskiing off <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard with <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON>, but often eludes the public eye camouflaged in a scarf and sunglasses. Her island house is at the end of a 2,000-foot driveway. The signs out front say `` No Trespassing.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>' battles with paparazzi are legendary. She repeatedly went to court to thwart the attentions of photographer <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Galella </PERSON>, first obtaining a court order barring <PERSON> Galella </PERSON> from coming within 30 feet of her or her children, then going to court to enforce that order. She declines all interviews, according to her spokeswoman, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuckerman </PERSON>. She would not speak on the 20th anniversary of the assassination; she will not speak on the quarter-century anniversary. But occasionally, New Yorkers catch glimpses. One newspaper recently showed <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>, a still youthful-looking grandmother, crossing a street while engrossed in a book, oblivious to the photographer. Even celebrity-immune New Yorkers stare when they spot her jogging in Central Park or shopping on Madison Avenue. `` You have two compartments. Your private and your public life,'' she once explained. `` I think I'm more of a private person. I do n't really like to call attention to anything.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Twenty-five years after the assassination, after <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>'s fall from grace with a Greek, after revelations about the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> era and after her determined efforts to maintain her privacy, a poll asked Americans to list their most admired first ladies. First was <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, the most active of all president's wives Second was <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, whose anti-drug campaign was the stuff of current headlines. And third was <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouvier </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>.

 When <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> took the podium at the Democratic National Convention in July, the national memory drifted back nearly 25 years, to the mind's image of a 3-year-old boy saluting his father's horse-drawn caisson. But this was no `` John-John'' on the stage in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. This was a darkly handsome, well-spoken law student who would soon be declared <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s sexiest man by a national magazine; this was a 28-year-old millionaire who had traveled the world and worked with the poor. More than a quarter-century has passed since <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and his sister, <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON>, now 30, charmed the nation with their Oval Office shenanigans. They endured the assassinations of their father in 1963 and their Uncle <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> in 1968. They adjusted when their mother married Greek shipping magnate <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> in 1968. Still, by all reports <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> thrived _ they did well in private schools, became proficient in sports, made lasting friendships and avoided the drugs that so twisted the lives of some of their cousins. Like their mother, both <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> children guard their privacy and decline all interview requests, said family spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuckerman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> earned a fine arts degree at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, then served as manager and coordinating producer of the office of film and television at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. She abandoned a career in photojournalism because other people aimed cameras at her every time she tried to take pictures. She married author-artist <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlossberg </PERSON> in July 1986. After a $ 1,250-a-week internship in 1987 as a summer associate at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm, she graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law school in May. She gave birth to a daughter, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlossberg </PERSON>, on June 25. Her brother has kept a more public profile. Now an athletic 6-foot-1, with matinee-idol good looks, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> recently was named by <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> as `` the sexiest man alive.'' Like his father, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has been described as extremely shy, although he did make a few campaign speeches when his cousin, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, ran for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> acted in two productions at <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, where he graduated in 1982. In the summer of 1985, he starred in a revival of a play called `` Winners,'' staged and directed by his fellow <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> graduates at the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. His co-star was <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Haag </PERSON>, an actress and his steady girlfriend of the past two years. They have known each other since they were both 15. There have been no theatrical experiences since. `` Acting is just a hobby,'' he once told a reporter. While an undergraduate, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> spent a summer traveling in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON>, his mother's friend, has mining and manufacturing interests. Another summer he worked as a <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> volunteer in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. Later, he spent six months working with the poor in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. In 1984, he began his first job, in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Office of Business Development. He also spent one summer as a $ 1,100-a-week intern at a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> law firm. The young <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who lives in a modest apartment in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, is a millionaire, thanks to a trust fund left by his father and the settlement his mother made with the <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> estate. Although he has no personal recollection of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> days _ he was only 3 when his father was killed _ he majored in American history in college, has studied his father's administration and is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Despite speculation about a possible political future, he has steadfastly denied having any definite career plans beyond <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where he is completing his final year.

<TEXT>
 With varying success, new video remembrances of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> reflect the magic and the fears of his 1,000 days in the White House. They're most effective when they show the young president speaking for himself _ in the witty repartee at news conferences, for instance _ and when they let real-time recordings register the grief at his death _ a reporter's voice breaking as he dictates from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, a waiter sobbing into a starched napkin at the luncheon where <LOCATION> JFK </LOCATION> was headed that day. One-hour biographies can hardly tell a life story like <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s. In the end, these retrospectives seem to move too fast, missing milestones. In presenting his personal life, they show the outdoorsman sailing or playing touch football, the father cuddling his kids, the dashing husband of a dazzling wife, the portrait that made the Camelot myth. The tabloids' man of clay is nowhere to be found. Still, it's nice to hear a president straightforwardly admit a big mistake, as <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> does a year or so after the Bay of Pigs. It's nice to feel the energy of an administration that holds a summit with the Soviet leader within six months of taking office. It's nice to see, again and again, that oh-so-easy smile. Here are glimpses of the new videos:

<HEAD>``JFK in His Own Words,'' HBO Video, $19.99</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The most personal of the remembrances, this one used 200 hours of film and, at least as importantly, 300 hours of voice recordings, so JFK is heard narrating his life. At one point, as he's seen reviewing troops and meeting with advisers, the familiar voice confides: `` The responsibilities placed on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are greater than I imagined them to be; and there are greater limitations upon our ability to bring about a favorable result than I imagined. ... It's much easier to make the speeches than it is to finally make the judgments.'' There are lighter moments in the film, which will air on <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> cable in November. During a televised call-in show when he's running for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, a caller suggests his wife would make a better senator. The smile. Then, `` I agree with that. But in any case, I have the benefit of her advice. So, maybe I'll improve.''

 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolper </PERSON> was executive producer of this documentary-style effort, first released the year after the assassination. Under a foreboding musical score, it follows the movements of JFK and of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>, effectively splicing news film with re-enactments by people who played supporting parts: a cab driver who picked up <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>, the shoe-shop owner who spotted the fugitive and tipped police. Waiting for the motorcade, the camera looks through a scope and fixes the crosshairs on passing traffic. The script is full of detail: the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> had checked the table decorations at the luncheon <LOCATION> JFK </LOCATION> was going to and would select his steak at random from 2,500.

JFK built up troop numbers in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> but took the first steps toward co-existence with the Soviets.

 Behind locked doors at the National Archives sit hundreds of dusty boxes, the product of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>' two-year investigation of the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> slayings. A decade has passed since the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assassinations </ORGANIZATION> ended its work by concluding that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and King were apparently the victims of conspiracies, but the committee documents, which scholars say would be important research tools, appear no closer to being opened to the public. `` What we're talking about is the records of our political history _ two of the most important events of the 20th century,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, a former committee aide who has led a small group of private Kennedy researchers in the fight to open the records. `` This is about the public's right to know.'' Most of the work conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which concluded that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> acted alone in the <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> slaying, has been opened to the public, a move that has helped researchers evaluate _ and in many cases strongly criticize _ that investigation. But the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee, the only government investigation to conclude that conspiracies were involved in either murder, ran out of money and was dissolved before voting to release its documents. Without such a vote, the materials fell under the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s so-called `` 50-year rule,'' keeping congressional documents under lock and key for a half-century The late Rep. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., a member of the select committee, had taken up the scholars' cause in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, fighting for a resolution to release most of the documents But he died in 1987. Rep. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, the committee chairman, originally led opposition to that resolution, but had a change of heart after <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>'s death, from AIDS, and said he would work for the information's release. That buoyed researchers, but the 1988 legislative session came and went without any action on the committee documents. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said he expected <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> to act next year on a measure that would immediately open some of the records, but he declined to provide specifics. The committee sent shockwaves around the world in December 1978 when it concluded that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s killing in 1963 was probably the result of a conspiracy _ pointing to accoustic evidence that experts said clearly showed the presence of a second gunman. The committee also concluded that a conspiracy likely was behind the King slaying in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> five years later. But in 1982, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> concluded that there was no evidence of a second <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> gunman and that the independent experts used by the committee incorrectly analyzed a tape recording made from a motorcycle policeman's open microphone. The experts' testimony had been the key to the committee's conclusion; before it, the panel had planned to conclude that there was no conspiracy Despite the academy study and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s final conclusion this year that there was no conspiracy in either slaying, <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> stands by his committee's report. `` It's a difference between scientists,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said.

 After 25 years, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> finally has matched courage with cash and will open the sixth floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depository </ORGANIZATION> to the world. Over the decades, the old warehouse has survived arsonists and calls for demolition. For a time, all buyers shunned it. All this ill will because of a new young order clerk named <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>, who, perched at a corner window on boxes of `` Rolling Readers,'' apparently fired two, maybe three, rifle shots at a motorcade passing below. Now workers are just a month away from topping off an outside elevator that will carry up to half-a-million visitors a year to the infamous sixth floor, where they can view an exhibit on President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and look out that corner window down to <LOCATION> Dealey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION>. It's a $ 3.5 million project 12 years in the making _ one that <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, for a long time, never wanted for fear of drawing more attention to a tragedy that heaped shame on the city. `` What we are doing is facing up to our history,'' said <PERSON> Lindalyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, who has made the exhibit a decade-long personal crusade. `` The old saying is, ` Time heals all wounds,''' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the chief of the county commissioners who made completion of the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> exhibit a priority in his 1987 inauguration speech. `` It's not unusual that sites of tragedy in history only recover over some period of time, like <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>, or the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>, or Yorktown,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` It's taken <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> 25 years to reach this consensus.'' Every day of the year, virtually around the clock, a steady trickle of tourists and tour buses makes the pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Dealey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION> and the grassy knoll. They find monuments but then learn they honor the city's founders. They see a 10-sentence plaque on the side of the book depository. The nine sentences noting the spot where <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> was settled are followed by this: `` On Nov. 22, 1963, the building gained national notoriety when <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> allegedly shot and killed President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> from a sixth floor window as the presidential motorcade passed the site.'' And then they invariably count six floors up. Next Feb. 20, on President's Day, `` The Sixth Floor Exhibit'' will open to the public. More than $ 1 million has been raised privately, with $ 300,000 to go. The fundraising effort took years, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said, and did n't really pick up until <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made it a county priority. `` It's easy to misunderstand what we're doing,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` There is a feeling among many of us who were living in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> at the time that we'd just as soon not be reminded.'' To permit construction to begin, the county advanced $ 2.2 million, which will be repaid through the $ 4 admission charge. The exhibit will be a maze of historical panels tied together with videos and movies produced by acclaimed filmmaker <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurow </PERSON> -LRB- `` Terms of Endearment,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Waltz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Across </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` Breakfast at <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION>'s'' -RRB-. `` It's far more than an assassination museum,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` It's about the life of President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, and his death. It's about the'60s and what <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> was like It puts everything in the context of American cultural history.'' The non-profit exhibit will have few actual artifacts _ no rifle, for example, only an original of the black-bordered anti-Kennedy ad, headlined `` Welcome to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>,'' that appeared in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that day, along with a reporter's notes and an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> teletype machine. There will be 400 photographs, many taken by the 22 people who were photographing the motorcade when the shots were fired. The corner window will be sealed by glass panels, although the actual green-painted window frame was removed by a previous owner. The spots where <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>'s rifle, three spent cartridges and palm prints were found will be recreated, based on police photos. The building, like <LOCATION> Dealey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION>, is remarkably unchanged from Nov. 22, 1963. The school book brokerage kept its lease in the building for eight years after the assassination. A <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, promoter bought it but failed to raise enough money to convert it into a Kennedy Museum. Ownership reverted to the previous owner, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> oil and real estate mogul <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, who then could not sell the building. Calls for its demolition were turned back because the city refused to issue a demolition permit. In 1977, voters approved a bond package that included $ 400,000 to purchase the warehouse and convert it _ except for the sixth floor _ into county office space. It is now the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Administration Building. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s second-floor office looks out on the spot where <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was shot `` No one can visit this building regularly and fail to be struck by the number of curious visitors,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` And everyone who works here is aware they're located in a place of unusual public interest.'' Over time, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> realized the world probably would never stop coming to <LOCATION> Dealey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION>. `` Over time, people finally felt they were able to put the experience behind them and they felt like the world was no longer viewing them as a community somehow responsible for the assassination,'' he said. `` Over time, the community has seen that the interest of the world is permanent and enduring.''

<TEXT>
 It is a novel with an ending dictated a quarter-century ago: A president is assassinated, his purported killer gunned down while in police custody. It also is a union of fact and fiction, a work of more than 100 real and invented characters that teeters on yesterday's headlines with its tale of the assassination of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the labyrinthine network of spies and mercenaries of civil servants, the brutal underworld of the mob and the lives and times of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>. In `` Libra,'' author <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLillo </PERSON> sets up the theory that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination was part of a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> scheme to rejuvenate, the corruption the anti-Castro movement in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> following the Bay of Pigs debacle. He futher hypothesizes that <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> killed <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> as part of a conspiracy with the Mafia to pay off a nightclub debt. He uses literary roads once traveled by such technicians of the `` nonfiction novel'' as the late <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> <PERSON> Capote </PERSON> in `` In Cold Blood'' and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mailer </PERSON> in `` Armies of the Night.'' <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> and others are not presented to us as mere cardboard shadows of news reports; <PERSON> DeLillo </PERSON> sks have been written about <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and his family, according to the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The assassination feeds a public hungry for any nugget that can explain what to many is still a hideous riddle. `` <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s death was tragic, but we remember what he did as president. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did n't do as much as <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>; he did n't have time,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> chronicler, friend and historian <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchester </PERSON> has said. `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>'s death was a tragedy and his life was a triumph. I think we should remember more than the tragedy. We should remember the triumph.'' The Kennedy slaying seems to haunt <PERSON> DeLillo </PERSON>'s earlier works, such as `` Running Dog'' and `` Players.'' His `` Americana'' ends in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Dealey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION>. However, `` Libra,'' which was <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>'s astrological sign, is no mere assassination theory book: Its tapestry is richer, with threads of human frailities, fears and desires woven into it. It is an intricate design of twists and turns and surprises.

 `` <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> turned up the handle, drew the bolt back. `` The President reacted, arms coming up, elbows high and wide. `` There were pigeons, suddenly everywhere, cracking down from the eaves and beating west. `` The report sounded over the plaza, flat and clear. `` The President's fists were clenched near his throat, arms bowed out. `` <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> drove the bolt forward, jerking the handle down. `` The <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was moving slower now. It was almost dead still. It was sitting naked in the street 80 yards from the underpass. `` Ready on the firing line.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 In a 1983 Rolling Stone article, <PERSON> DeLillo </PERSON> called the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> assassination `` a story about our uncertain grip on the world.'' It was a tale, he said, `` exploded into life by a homeless man who himself could not grip things tightly and hold them fast, whose soul-scarred loneliness and rage led him to invent an American moment that echoes down the decades.'' After writing the article for Rolling Stone, he spent three years researching and writing `` Libra.'' He shoveled his way through the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>'s 26 volumes of the <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Report, which concluded that <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> was the sole assassin. He also visited places in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> had lived. <PERSON> DeLillo </PERSON> has an afterword in `` Libra,'' a disclaimer of sorts: `` This is a work of imagination. While drawing from the historical record, I've made no attempt to furnish factual answers to any question raised by the assassination.''

 It came as no surprise to anyone in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that a novelist, poet and essayist, <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON>, would seek to become president of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. For <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON>, frequently mentioned as a future winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, is following a centuries-old tradition of an area where cultural figures, both classical and pop, have also played important political roles. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s Vice President <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, himself a writer and educator as well as politician, says that in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> individuals who have distinguished themselves in literature and art can carry their prestige into politics because they live in `` half finished'' societies that value men of multiple talents. `` In societies that have not evolved greatly, there is little specialization,'' <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, who is 88 and has written more than 100 books, said in an interview. `` The politician can be a writer, a priest, a military man, many things.'' <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON>, who once described himself as a `` specialist in fanatasies, in dreams,'' stands in sharp contrast to the professional politicians and technocrats in many other parts of the world. `` This is definitely not my calling,'' the 52-year-old writer said recently. `` If my country were not what it is, politics would probably be a very secondary concern in my life.'' Instead, the author of such books as `` The <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` Conversation in a Cathedral'' finds himself leading a center-right political movement that seeks to prevent the election in 1990 of <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrantes </PERSON>, a declared Communist now favored to win the presidency. `` I am fundamentally a writer, but at the same time I am a person concerned about the reality of his country and, above all, its future,'' said <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is wracked by its worst economic crisis of the century, with the annual inflation rate surpassing 1,200 percent. It also is bloodied by a savage leftist insurgency that has claimed more than 12,000 lives. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON> has been traveling into <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s remote backlands, climbing down mine shafts high in the Andes and visiting isolated Indian villages in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> forests to spread his message of the dangers that await <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> if the next presidential election is won by Communists. `` They would impoverish us even more than we are now and little by little, just as has occurred with other Marxist regimes, they would totally trample our political freedoms,'' he declared at a recent rally.

We are all vain,'' said <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, a founder of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s populist <ORGANIZATION> Aprista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s ouster led to a 1965 popular rebellion that ended after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops invaded the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.

He received 18 percent of the vote in 1986, but polls indicate that if the elections were held today, he would win against conservative President <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON>, a lawyer and also a writer. In <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, where the national language is <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> has written collections of poetry and short stories, some of which have been translated into English, Spanish, French and Russian. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> has called his election to the prestigious Brazilian Academy of Letters `` the greatest moment of pure happiness in my life.'' The list of distinguished Latin American writers and artists who have sought public office or influenced public policy through their political activism is long. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s most famed literary figure, the poet <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Neruda </PERSON>, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1971, was the <ORGANIZATION> Chilean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s candidate for president in 1970.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s foremost living writers, <PERSON> Octavio </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>, are among the sharpest critics of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s system of government, under which the same party been in power for six decades Paz charges the long-dominant <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which emerged from the 1910-20 revolution, has become corrupt. <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON> maintains the revolution itself was betrayed and corrupted even before it was over. Both writers were born in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and are recipients of the prestigious <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cervantes </PERSON> prize, the foremost literary award for Spanish writers. Both lived abroad for many years and served as Mexican diplomats, and both resigned for the same reason _ the bloody suppression of student riots in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1968. Although they no longer have any direct influence on government, their works and statements provoke thought and sometimes acrimonious debate among their countrymen. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON>, once an admirer of Marxism, now calls himself a `` European-style social democrat'' and says he has little use for Marxist ideology. <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON> has been called a `` liberal'' but so far has not committed himself to any ideology; he has been criticized by <PERSON> Paz </PERSON>'s fans on grounds that he has spent so much time abroad that he does n't know <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> anymore Even so, his influence was demonstrated after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election when his long analysis of the American outcome was published on the front page of one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s leading newspapers, Excelsior. <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON> credited <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aide, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, with running a brilliant, cynical and pragmatic campaign and said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s appointment as Secretary of State was a good sign for U.S.-Mexico relations because of what he called <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s pragmatic turn of mind <PERSON> Paz </PERSON>'s most influential work, the 1950 book-length essay `` The Labyrinth of Solitude,'' attacks the notion that the Mexican has developed a philosophy of his own. Instead, he says the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> has isolated himself from the world and should seek to break that pathological solitude. `` The whole history of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> ... can be regarded as a search for our own selves, which have been deformed by alien institutions, and a form that will express them,'' Paz says. In <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>' best known novel, `` The Death of <PERSON> Artemio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>,'' the reader listens in on the thoughts of the dying hero who reflects on the 12 most important days of his life and the events that brought on the corruption of the revolution's ideals. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> was born March 31, 1914, and lived in exile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for a time as a teen-ager because of his father's revolutionary activities While still a law student, he became a protege of the Chilean Nobel Prize-winning poet <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Neruda </PERSON>, who helped him publish his first book of poems, inspired him with Marxist ideals and sent him to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> at the height of that country's 1936-39 civil war. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> joined <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s leftist Republican forces, insisted on being sent to the front but was not considered `` reliable'' enough to be given a rifle. Within a few years he became disillusioned with Marxism and had a falling out with <PERSON> Neruda </PERSON>, then the Chilean ambassador. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> joined the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> foreign service but quit in 1968 when he was ambassador to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to protest the suppression of the student riots. He turned against the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in power for the past 59 years, which he has often called `` corrupt.'' He also raised hackles by equating <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> with <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s rightist dictator, Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, claiming that both are equally repressive. Four years ago he caused a furor by calling <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista revolution _ which <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> supports _ inconsequential. The son of a career diplomat, <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON> was born on Nov. 11, 1928, has lived most of his life abroad and is fluent in English. He is currently a professor of literature at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>, too, joined the diplomatic service, but resigned in 1977 while he was ambassador to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> because <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordaz </PERSON> was named ambassador to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordaz </PERSON> had been president in 1968, and <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON> said he did not want to be in the same service with the man who ordered the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> massacre that left at least 36 dead. <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>' novels include `` Hydra Head,'' `` Where the Air is Clear,'' and `` Old Gringo,'' the fictionalized story of American writer and journalist <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierce </PERSON>, who disappeared in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> during the revolution. Literary critics and historian <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Krauze </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paz </PERSON>'s friend and colleague, have accused <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON> of losing touch with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. In an article he wrote for The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> last June bitingly entitled `` The Guerrilla Dandy,'' <PERSON> Krauze </PERSON> asked of <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>, `` Is he a willing exile from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, or a reluctant exile from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>?'' `` His work simplifies the country; his view is frivolous, unrealistic and, all too often, false,'' <PERSON> Krauze </PERSON> added. `` I visit <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> regularly,'' said <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON> in reply. `` I go to places where no one goes. I talk with the common people more than with the intellectuals.''

<HEAD>Caught in the Middle: The Sandwich Generation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Caught in a vise between the financial needs of children and the care of elderly parents, a generation of Americans is confronted with planning problems that almost defy solution. They are the `` sandwich generation,'' age 45 to 55 years, with college-age children and parents whose incomes are limited. Unlike the very poor, the minorities, the elderly and disadvantaged, this group has little political clout. Its existence barely recognized, it is nevertheless destined to grow because of biological and sociological factors. Among those factors: Parents are living longer, but their income-producing years generally are not being extended. And young marrieds are waiting until the last tick of the biological clock before having children. As a consequence, the sandwich generation's parents become aged and more dependent just as the offspring are preparing for or entering college. Rising tuitions add to the pressure. To deal with the phenomenon, financial planners are seeking creative investment techniques for the sandwich generation, but in almost every instance those techniques require many years to become effective. Moreover, the old and once-trusted method of shifting assets to a controlled trust and automatically getting them back after the demise of the parents does not work any more, thanks to the 1986 Tax Reform Act. In addition, the tax laws make inefficient the simple, direct technique of providing support from the checkbook, because such funding involves after-tax dollars, effectively reducing the benefit to 72 cents on the dollar. The tax law does leave two exceptions, but many members of the sandwich generation may find them inapplicable to them. The exceptions are: _ If you provide more than one-half of a parent's support, and the parent earns less than $ 1,900 a year, you may claim the $ 1,000 dependency exemption on your tax return _ You may claim your parents' medical expenses along with your own as long as you provide one-half of your parents' support And in this case, the $ 1,000 gross income test need not be met. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, an accounting partner in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Deloitte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haskins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sells, believes a member of the sandwich generation should find a way to transfer assets to parents so that the parents instead are taxed. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, who made a special study of the situation, notes that if you transferred titled property to your parents, particularly property with an income, you can effectively move income to their lower tax bracket. One approach along this line would be to set up a trust, put assets in the trust and instruct the trustee to use all income for the parents. This income then becomes taxed to the parents. While you lose total control of the funds, the trust could be so arranged that the assets are distributed as provided in the parents' wills, which means the money could very well revert to you Ms. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> suggests that a second plan would be to create the trust to pay income to the parents for life, with the assets to go to the sandwich generation's children upon the parents' death. This plan might combine support of aging parents at a minimum after-tax cost and provide gifts to children for education. Still, there is no assurance that the money would be available in time to help pay tuition. Another strategy is to have aging parents sell their home and use the funds for support. They would then live in a residence, perhaps a condominium, purchased by their children, who could tap their own home for an equity loan. If all works as intended, these might be among the results: _ The aging parents could shelter up to $ 125,000 of the gain from the sale of their home _ They would have money to live on _ They could pay their children rent _ The sandwich generation members might have tax deductions from their equity loan _ The sandwich generation members might be able to deduct rental property losses _ They also would have an investment that, if it were properly selected, might earn an excellent return None of the solutions is without risk, especially in view of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' inclination to change tax laws. But for those in a very difficult financial squeeze, they at least offer hope that the pain will be reduced.

 Interest rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities rose in the government's latest auction to the highest level in more than three years. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 7.2 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.82 percent on Monday, up from 7.54 percent last week.

The sale brings the total of American corn sold to the Soviets for delivery in the 1988-89 marketing year to 4,715,600 tons, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The statement did not provide further details, but last week's price of $ 134.50 a metric ton for grain delivered at <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> would make the sale worth about $ 40.3 million A metric ton is equivalent to 2,200 pounds. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been buying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain in substantial quantities despite the expiration on Sept. 30 of a five-year grain agreement between the two countries. Negotiations aimed at reaching a new agreement have been going on periodically for a year, although there have been no formal talks since Oct. 14, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rejected a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> proposal of a one-year agreement.

 Sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Savings Bonds increased in October for the second time in seven months, rising 5.6 percent to $ 548 million, the government reports. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that sales in October were up $ 29 million from September and up $ 132 million from October 1987, a 12.5 percent increase. Sales had fallen 10.8 percent in September and risen 3.4 percent in August. Treasury officials are looking for increasing sales of savings bonds because interest rates, starting Nov. 1 and effective through April 30, will be 7.35 percent, up from 6.9 percent the preceding six months. Since November 1982, savings bonds held five years or longer earn market based rates. The new rate is the highest since April 30, 1985. As of Oct. 31, the total value of savings bonds held by Americans was $ 108.5 billion, up 9 percent from a year earlier.

 A new computerized hotel reservations system being developed by media tycoon <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> and nine hotel chains could allow travelers to book rooms like they book airline tickets. The new system, called UltraSwitch, will provide a central electronic source of hotel room information for the participating hotels and for travel agents, officials of the venture told a news conference Monday. Currently, only a small fraction of hotel rooms are booked electronically, using the computer systems provided by major airlines to travel agents. Most hotel bookings are made through toll-free `` 800'' numbers or directly with hotels, methods which are more expensive for the hotels to process. Under UltraSwitch, the number of electronic hotel bookings made by travel agents will increase, the officials said. The system also will provide a central pool of information on rooms available at the participating hotels. By using new computer software, UltraSwitch will link the five existing airline reservations systems in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with those used by participating hotels. If a hotel is full, for example, it will be able to tell travel agents what rooms are available at other participating hotels in the same city. This is the practice followed by the airlines, which often will book a passenger on another carrier's flight if one of their own flights is full. UltraSwitch, which is expected to serve hotels in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad, is scheduled to be operating before the end of next year. `` The consumer will now have the best opportunity to get what he wants,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrail </PERSON>, senior vice president of marketing for Days Inns of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McGrail </PERSON> also is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Switch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, or THISCO, formed by the nine participating hotel chains and <ORGANIZATION> Murdoch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The participating chains are Best Western, Days Inns, Hyatt Hotels, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quinta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inns </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, Quality Inns, <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inns </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sheraton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Trusthouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION>. They each will have one share in THISCO. <ORGANIZATION> Murdoch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION>, which is putting up $ 8 million to $ 9 million to finance the project, will own a special class of stock in THISCO. <PERSON> McGrail </PERSON> said the group also hoped to attract as shareholders other hotel chains, and possibly airlines and other companies. The nine participating hotel chains represent about half of the major hotel chains in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We'll see a marriage here eventually between'' airline and hotel reservations systems and travel agents, said <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, who flew in from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for the news conference. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> said he got involved because some of the magazines he publishes are `` entirely dependent'' on advertising by hotels and airlines. The publications include Hotel and Travel Index, Travel Weekly, Official Hotel and Resort Guide, Meetings and <ORGANIZATION> Conventions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>, Official Meetings and Facilities Guide, and <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>. The software for UltraSwitch will be developed mainly by <ORGANIZATION> Anasazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, which has developed programs for the hotel and financial services industries.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> insurance officials reacted with surprise to <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to become the third major insurer in two yeras to stop writing new auto insurance policies in the state. `` We had no advance knowledge,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, deputy <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> insurance commissioner, said Monday. `` I guess our overall assessment is we think the company was premature in assessing the effect of the recently passed auto reform bill on the market.'' <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> officials say frustration and the state's regulatory climate prompted the company's decision, which comes amid a wave of anger by insurers nationwide over changing regulatory climates. <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> has lost $ 115 million in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> over the past five years, largely as a result of the `` unique regulatory environment'' for auto insurance, said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> division. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> made his comments during a news conference to announce <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION>'s decision not to renew its license when it expires June 30. `` We have no intention to return,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. The announcement came about a week after a number of insurers doing business in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> promised to leave that market _ the nation's biggest _ after voters approved a measure providing deep cuts in auto and other insurance rates. <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> will continue selling new policies and follow through on all its <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> policies until they expire, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. Last week, a bill was signed into law that will reduce 1989 insurance premiums in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> by 16 percent, or $ 400 million, by cracking down on fraud and abuse in the system, reducing required coverages and limiting the number of auto cases that end up in court. The legislation came after industry court challenges and rate decisions increased rates by nearly one third since 1986 to among the highest in the country. <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> saw some encouraging improvements for consumers in the bill. But <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said it did little or nothing to restore free markets to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> state law requires all companies wishing to sell any form of insurance in the state to participate in an open `` high-risk'' auto insurance pool. State law also forbids open competition for automobile insurance. Instead, the state insurance commissioner annually calculates a single statewide rate for each category of compulsory and optional insurance. Only <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has a similar system. <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Northbrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, has been doing business in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> since 1951. The company has 6.6 percent of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> auto insurance market and 5.2 percent of the state's homeowners insurance market <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> accounts for some $ 199 million of <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION>'s premiums annually, or about 2 percent of the company's business in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> has 573 full - and part-time employees at several locations in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> will `` make every effort to try to relocate qualified employees'' and predicted there would be few or no layoffs. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, voters last week approved Proposition 103, which mandates that property and casualty insurers roll their rates back to a level 20 percent below those in effect on Nov. 8, 1987. In a addition, drivers with good records would get an additional 20 percent off. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has delayed the start of the law while it considers its constitutionality. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> was confident the insurers would prevail in court. He also said <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> had no intention to pull out of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which he described as quite different from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in that it allows `` open competition.'' More than 100 companies sell auto insurance in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, but 90 percent of the coverage is written by the top 25 insurers. <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> ranked fourth in statewide market share. <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION>'s departure was preceded in the past two years by <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fireman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> and two smaller companies. All cited millions of dollars in losses in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> auto market for their decisions. To continue writing other forms of insurance in the state, <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> recently won state regulatory and legislative approval to set up a spinoff company to assume its auto insurance business. Fireman's Fund, meanwhile, agreed to pay a $ 45 million settlement to the state as compensation to the high-risk drivers' pool so it could abandon the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> market. Since reaching that settlement last year, the company has proposed buying a subsidiary firm with <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> licenses so Fireman's Fund could re-enter the state and sell other forms of insurance.

 Japanese companies are poised to erode the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' lead in the biotechnology race, partly by introducing biotech lipstick, wine, detergent and other products that help build grassroots support for the field, according to a panel of industry experts. `` The Japanese are more unique and more innovative in the use of biotech,'' said <PERSON> Akihiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoshikawa </PERSON>, a biotechnology research director at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. He also predicted <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would be the world biotechnology leader by the year 2000. <PERSON> Yoshikawa </PERSON> made his remarks at a news conference Monday marking the opening of <LOCATION> Biotech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, a three-day industry conference and exhibition. Participants called on American business, government and research leaders to forge a long-term strategy _ including government assistance _ to help the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintain its competitive place in the international biotechnology market. Industry watchers fear history will repeat itself and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will lose its lead in biotechnology as it lost the lead in electronics and computer chip manufacturing. `` We have a tremendous lead, we discovered it and it's sort of been our baby,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>. `` We still have time to do something if we can get our act together,'' said <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, who sponsored legislation this year to consolidate the government's role in biotechnology `` We can do a hell of a lot better job than we've done in some other areas. In fact, we've got to. Other countries are not sitting still.'' <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>' legislation failed, but its key elements have been implemented, he said. <PERSON> Yoshikawa </PERSON> joked that `` you do n't want to try Japanese biotech wine,'' but nevertheless praised Japanese companies for introducing household products created through biotechnology. `` People are not afraid of trying something new,'' he said. `` That may be a key factor for Japanese success in biotechnology.'' The wine is made with a tissue culture of the slow-growing ginseng root that is produced in a test tube, and purple-colored biotech lipstick is made with a tissue culture pigment rather than a costly plant-based coloring agent, he said. `` Biotech companies can not survive ... without some systematic government protections,'' <PERSON> Yoshikawa </PERSON> said, mentioning funding, product protections and other support mechanisms. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the leading threat to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s edge, according to panelists who said Japanese product approval regulations and patent laws can slow the introduction of American products in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Rathmann </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> AmGen </ORGANIZATION>, a biotech firm based in <LOCATION> Thousand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said government support could include speeding up the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> patent process and possibly subsidizing research.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> faced a major image problem from a minor part of its insurance business, but the company's handling of controversy over its drought insurance should keep its name relatively unclouded, analysts say. `` They really exhibited the type of concern about the quality of their business and their reputation,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> took a major step toward putting the controversy behind it last week when it announced a $ 48 million settlement to a class-action suit representing 8,000 farmers in 10 midwestern states. Farmers had sued when applications for insurance over this summer's drought were denied. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> still must approve the settlement. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>, based in <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, was prepared to offer $ 40 million in insurance for below average rainfall. But brokers sold more than $ 300 million in coverage, enraging the farmers who were denied coverage and prompting at least seven state insurance departments to launch proceedings against the company. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> took steps to repair the damage, including granting $ 11 million in goodwill payments, setting up a crisis center to answer questions and taking out newspaper advertisements, all in advance of last week's settlement. `` I think they as a company want to get this behind them'' and `` out of the press,'' said <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` They are a company with a sizable ego to match what is over time a pretty darn good company,'' <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> said. `` They have nurtured their reputation.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> `` bent over backwards to appease all parties involved,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Weather insurance constitutes less than 1 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>'s business Its main lines are commercial property and casualty insurance, and it also specializes in products such as corporate officer liability insurance and upper-income homeowners' insurance, said <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON>. Financially, costs associated with the insurance and controversy could cost investors about 76 cents a share for 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> has estimated. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, expects 1988 earnings to be $ 8 a share, excluding one-time tax benefits. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 345 million, or $ 8.29 a share in 1987. It is the nation's 16th largest property and casualty insurer, with assets of $ 9.4 billion as of Sept. 30. Analysts said the drought insurance program was unusual partly because <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> had an outside managing general agent, <ORGANIZATION> Good </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, design and handle the policy. That was a rarity for <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>, and unlikely to happen again, said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. The company has said Good Weather exceeded its authority in offering more than $ 40 million in insurance. `` I think they'll be more careful with how they -LRB- deal -RRB- with managing general agents,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said. Eventually, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said, `` Wall Street will forget about -LRB- the controversy -RRB- and concentrate on 1989 numbers.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> is not contemplating offering a similar type of drought insurance next year, said company spokeswoman <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Devlin </PERSON>. She said it was not appropriate to discuss plans beyond that.

 The incoming chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> says tax increases will be needed next year to make legally required cuts in the federal deficit, despite President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s anti-tax stance. `` Anybody who's dealt with budget issues knows the size of the challenge is too large to exempt any areas,'' Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., said in an interview `` Once you say this area wo n't be considered, you paint yourself into a corner.'' <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said new revenues will have to be part of any package for the required reduction of red ink by tens of billions of dollars, regardless of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s oft-repeated campaign pledge `` no new taxes.'' Under the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law, the deficit for the 1990 fiscal year _ which begins Oct. 1 _ is not to exceed $ 100 billion. Last week, just two days after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was elected, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> raised its 1990 deficit estimate to $ 132 billion. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said he believes the shortfall will be even higher _ closer to $ 140 billion or $ 150 billion. If the deficit target is exceeded, the law requires automatic spending cuts to pare the red ink to $ 100 billion. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s well-known `` read my lips'' promise to oppose tax increases `` create a potential for confrontation'' between Democrats and Republicans. `` Republicans will feel a commitment was made that ca n't be breached in any way, and <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON> will say why should we vote for a tax increase if he has made that commitment,'' <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, who takes over the budget panel when lawmakers return in January, said he believes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s willingness to compromise will be apparent when he submits his first budget to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, perhaps in February or March. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will present his final budget to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 9, but lame duck presidents' final budgets can be rewritten by their successors. `` If <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> submits his budget proposal and if it reflects the same <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> priorities that he's submitted time and time again, that have been declared dead on arrival, and if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replays those same priorities, that will be a signal that we're in for more confrontation on the budget issue,'' <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said he hopes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will begin seeking congressional input early on so his spending plan reflects agreements with <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on taxes. `` If not, I suspect we'll be fighting tooth and nail to see what can be done,'' he said. On the campaign trail, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed a `` flexible freeze'' plan for balancing the budget. Under the proposal, overall government spending would be allowed to keep up with inflation, with cuts in some programs and increases for others. He never provided any specifics, however. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said that with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insisting he will not slash large chunks of the budget _ such as defense and Social Security _ there simply will not be enough vulnerable programs left to yield sizable savings from spending cuts. `` I've looked at that thing in a dozen different ways and do n't see how it works,'' <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said of the flexible freeze plan <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said he believes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not yet made it politically impossible for himself to agree to tax increases. He said that just as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agreed to several tax increases despite his anti-tax rhetoric, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could shift his position. `` The president will have to say to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people that we're facing a major crisis in dealing with the deficit, and the only way to meet the challenge is to sit down and work out a package with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa., is stepping down after four years as budget committee chairman Under House rules, a lawmaker can only head the budget panel for four years.

The ruling `` weakens their case, and it becomes incumbent upon <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> managers to come up with their own offer,'' she said.

The West Point-based diversified manufacturer of consumer soft goods including Arrow shirts and <ORGANIZATION> Martex </ORGANIZATION> towels sought to protect itself against a possible takeover by Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 2.87 million shares, or 9.8 percent, of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> stock. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, a maker of clothing, including Fruit of the Loom underwear, and precision metal products, announced its attempt to buy <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> May 23. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s offer is based on 16.73 million shares being tendered, and other conditions, and expires at midnight EST, Nov. 21. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> stock closed Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> at $ 42 per share, down 87 -LCB- cents. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s board created the pill in October 1987 to protect itself against a possible hostile takeover. The pill allowed stockholders not involved in a takeover attempt to purchase additional shares, which would sharply increase the cost of a buyout. In response to suits by both corporations against each other and other defendants over the plan, <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> voided the rights agreement. `` The court finds no authority in either the state law or <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>'s Articles of Incorporation which authorize the rights plan,'' <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> wrote. He said the plan discriminated among shareholders because some were given rights not allowed others in a takeover attempt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, chairman of the company seeking to take over <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>, said, `` We are pleased by the court's ruling and believe that it will facilitate the successful completion of our offer.'' `` In light of the court's decision, we believe that the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> board should recommend the acceptance of our offer, which is a full and fair one.'' <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> had countersued <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> and asked for preliminary injunctions against the takeover on two grounds: that the company violated a `` standstill agreement'' executed when <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> acquired textile maker <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in March and that <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s proposed financing package violated federal margin Another defendant in <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s suit was <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based financial services corporation which was involved in the dismantling of <PERSON> J.P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. The standstill agreement approved March 13 specified that none of the parties involved would assist or encourage any attempt to acquire <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, which <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> now owns. The suit claimed <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> was providing assistance to <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> in the takeover attempt in violation of the agreement. <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> ruled that neither <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> nor <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> were parties to the standstill agreement and, among other things, `` there has been no showing that either <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, or derivatively, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, used any confidential information obtained by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'' in connection with the buyout of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> takeover attempt. <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> conceded `` the showing made by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> indicates that <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s financing is substantially suspect and may be a violation of the margin requirements,'' but ruled `` <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> has adequately disclosed the potential effect of the alleged margin violations'' and denied the request for an injunction.

<HEAD>Quasar Must Pay $3.8 Million in Discrimination Case: Attorneys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal jury has awarded $ 3.8 million to three former <ORGANIZATION> Quasar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> employees, all over 50, who were fired and whose duties were transferred to younger men, their attorneys say. A federal jury Monday awarded $ 1.9 million _ between $ 508,000 and $ 713,000 to each man _ but the total amount was being doubled to $ 3.8 million because the jury found the discrimination was willful, the attorneys said. Quasar, a sales subsidiary of Japanese-owned <ORGANIZATION> Matsushita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Paramus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, dismissed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> and <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> during a 1986 company restructuring that affected approximately 200 workers in <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. Attorney <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bashwiner </PERSON>, who represented Quasar, declined to comment on the verdict. `` There were several tip-offs that discrimination might be a part of the picture,'' said plaintiff attorney <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>. `` The company continued to hire new people. The vast majority of them were very young, under 40. `` They told our clients that their jobs were being eliminated, but they reassigned those functions to younger people,'' he said. <PERSON> Fortino </PERSON>, 58, had been assistant general manager of the advertising and sales promotion department at Quasar's <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> facility since March 1979. He was awarded $ 508,857, or $ 1.01 million when doubled. <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, 53, was a nine-year employee and manager of sales administration at the site. He receives $ 728,223, or $ 1.45 million when doubled. <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>, 54, had worked for Quasar and its former owner, <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, since 1957. When he was forced to leave, he was national manager of physical distribution. He was awarded $ 713,908 or $ 1.42 million. The jury rejected a claim made by a fourth former worker, <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustachio </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>.

 Stocks opened slightly higher this morning but trading was light, reflecting investor reluctance to participate ahead of the government's potentially market-moving monthly trade report.

Among broader market indicators, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index of all listed issues rose 0.29 to 151.33.

Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 15 million shares after the first 30 minutes. Wall Street strategists said the market remains preoccupied with the weak dollar and fear of higher interest rates, which hurt stocks in the aftermath of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential election victory a week ago. If the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report on the September merchandise trade deficit Wednesday is substantially above the expectations of a $ 10.5 billion shortfall, many investment professionals expect the market to weaken because it will likely mean the dollar will fall again. `` The real focus is on the trade numbers tomorrow,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> DaPuzzo </PERSON>, manager of retail equities at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We wo n't see anything more clearly until after those numbers come out.''

<HEAD>Grand Met Extends $60-Per-Share Offer for Pillsbury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grand Metropolitan PLC today extended for the third time its $ 5.23 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, saying that 79.1 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> stock now has been tendered to the British conglomerate. The $ 60-per-share takeover offer, which was to expire Monday night, was extended until Nov. 18. Grand Met said that as of the Monday night deadline, nearly 67.6 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> common stock, representing approximately 79.1 percent of the outstanding shares, had been tendered and not withdrawn. When it extended its second deadline of Nov. 8, Grand Met reported that about 74.3 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> outstanding shares had been tendered. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Haeg </PERSON> said today the Minneapolis-based food and restaurant company would have no comment on the latest extension. On Oct. 4, Grand Met undertook one of the biggest hostile takeover attempts on a company with its offer for <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> later announced a restructuring that included spinning off its <ORGANIZATION> Burger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary as an independent company. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> and Grand Met also have been skirmishing in court over the validity of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s `` poison pill'' takeover defense, which would make a hostile acquisition prohibitively expensive. Grand Met said Friday a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> judge had requested briefs by Monday from both sides on new motions in the British firm's suit to quash the pill. Meanwhile, the British company's chief of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations, <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, said he was taking seriously rumors that a group of unidentified investors were seeking buyers for all or parts of the London-based distilling, gambling and franchise conglomerate. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said one of the potential participants might be <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>. Part of the reason Grand Metropolitan might be considered an attractive takeover target is the difference between its stock price of about $ 8 a share and its estimated breakup value of between $ 12.50 and $ 18 a share. That degree of discrepancy can invite takeover bids by investors who hope to profit by selling pieces of a target company.

<HEAD>Lukman Calls For Higher Oil Production Ceiling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> called for a higher oil production ceiling for the 13-nation cartel Tuesday, and warned that a price war would erupt if the group's members did not respect their output quotas, a published report said Tuesday. Oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are gathering in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> for their semi-annual meeting on Nov. 21, which has taken on added importance because of a plunge in oil price as a result of over production. <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, quoted in an interview with the daily <ORGANIZATION> Al-Watan </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, did not specify what the new production ceiling should be. But he excluded a rise to as many as 22 million barrels a day. Current <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> output is estimated at just below that figure, because of overproduction by some cartel members. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s current production ceiling is 16.6 million barrels a day. This includes a quota of 1.5 million barrels for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which rejected this figure when it was set in Dec. 1986 and is currently producing almost double that amount. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and its sister states in the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> have proposed that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> be given a quota equal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 2.3 million barrels per day, to raise the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ceiling to at least 17.4 million barrels per day. The other GCC states are <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the world's largest oil producer, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> stressed in the interview that adherence by member states to the production quotas was the best way to raise the price of oil above the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> benchmark of $ 18 per barrel. The current world oil glut has forced the price down to around $ 13 per barrel. `` As the present <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreement expires at the end of December, we have to reach a new accord in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, but this time we aspire to see the agreement signed by all 13 members,'' <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> said. He warned the agreement would collapse if it was violated by anyone. He explained that `` in the past some members managed to go on violating the agreement because other members stuck to their quotas. `` But if the coming agreement is violated by any member, all members will have to increase their production. Those violators are well aware of this fact,'' he said.

<HEAD>Beazer Buying Out Deal Partners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 British industrialist <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> announced a refinancing plan that eliminates one of the most contentious issues in his hostile $ 1.8 billion takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s company, <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, plans to acquire the interests of its partners, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, in <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. BNS is the shell company formed to launch the takeover last The partners are to be bought out by the end of February, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s group investment director, said Monday. In a separate development Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> announced from Bath, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, that it has conditionally agreed to sell <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Wolman </PERSON> division, a leading supplier of timber treatment products and services, to <ORGANIZATION> Hickson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> for $ 67.5 million in cash. The deal depends on approval by the <PERSON> Hickson </PERSON> shareholders and regulatory clearance. It is part of the ongoing program for disposal of the Koppers chemicals operations. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION>'s ownership of the takeover company <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> was criticized by <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> and the Pittsburgh-based company's allies as a dangerous precedent in which an investment bank was in effect helping take over a company. BNS would then be disbanded, and <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> would become fully responsible for debt incurred in the <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> takeover. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> owns 46.1 percent of BNS, and a National Westminster subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NatWest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, owns 4.9 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> owns 49 percent. The transfers are part of a refinancing in which a consortium led by <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> will lend <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> $ 2.3 billion. About $ 1.3 billion of that will refinance debt from the takeover and $ 570 million will substitute for money <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> planned to raise by selling high-yield junk bonds, the British company said in a letter to shareholders. By not issuing the bonds, <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> expects to save $ 25 million in interest expense. The remaining $ 400 million will be temporary financing to be repaid by future sales from <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' chemical operations.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Mostly Lower In Early Trading</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures were mostly lower in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting disappointment about the size of corn sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and a weakening technical picture. The corn market registered little excitement about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s purchase of 300,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced the sale late Monday after the corn market already had closed higher on rumors the Soviets had bought as much as 2 million metric tons of corn, analysts said. Wheat prices were narrowly mixed this morning while soybeans were under pressure due to weakening chart signals, which prompted one independent trader to unload a large amount of futures contracts. `` The beans are acting pretty well as far I'm concened, especially with someone pounding on them like that,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, a grain market specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In early trading, wheat was 1 \ cents lower to 2 cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.19 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 1 -RCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.70 \ a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 \ cents lower with December at $ 2.12 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans were unchanged to 3 -LCB- cents lower with November at $ 7.55 -LCB- Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Retail sales, bolstered by big gains at department stores and auto dealerships, jumped 0.9 percent in October, the biggest increase in seven months, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said sales rose $ 1.2 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 135.6 billion. In September, they fell by 0.3 percent after rising by a similar 0.3 percent in August. The October increase was the steepest since March, when sales shot up 1.6 percent. Most economists had been expecting a milder rise of about 0.3 percent last month. Retail sales are closely watched by analysts as a barometer of overall consumer demand. Consumer spending, including services, which are not included in the retail sales report, accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. Analysts have been divided in recent months over whether economic growth is slowing. Sluggish retail sales in September, along with weak job growth, led many to conclude that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s effort to curb growth to non-inflationary levels through increases in interest rates was working. However, the early indications are that the economy rebounded in October. In addition to the substantial gain in retail sales, the unemployment rate dropped, matching a 14-year low. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> called the reports on retail sales and industrial production _ which showed a rise of 0.4 percent in October _ `` very positive and very encouraging for continued steady growth in the economy.'' `` We see no evidence of rekindling inflation, inflation remains low and under control and the economy appears to be on a very sound and steady basis,'' he said. Auto sales in October jumped 1.7 percent to $ 29.2 billion, after falling 2.2 percent a month earlier. It was only the second increase since March. Excluding the automotive category, which is the most volatile, sales rose 0.7 percent last month after a 0.2 percent increase in September. Sales at department and other general merchandise stores shot up 2.4 percent to $ 15.6 billion last month, following a 0.8 percent gain in September. August sales had been depressed by hotter-than-normal weather. Sales of durable goods, `` big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years rose 0.9 percent last month, as did non-durable goods sales. Hardware, garden and building supply stores reported no change in October after a 0.8 percent rise a month earlier. Furniture stores posted a modest 0.2 percent gain after falling 0.3 percent in September. Food and grocery stores reported a 1.1 percent gain, gasoline stations a 1.2 percent jump, specialty clothing stores a 1.3 percent increase, and drug stores a 0.6 percent rise. The only category reporting a decline was restaurants and bars, down 0.2 percent after a 1.3 percent increase in September. For the first 10 months of the year, sales were up 6.1 percent over the same period of 1987, barely keeping ahead of the inflation rate.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> reportedly is probing allegations that a group of former <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> classmates who work on Wall Street have traded illegally on inside information about corporate takeovers. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, quoting what it called documents and unidentified sources familiar with the case, said Tuesday that the subject of <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> scrutiny was a group of about a dozen <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> graduates, some of them former fraternity brothers, a number of whom are professional stock speculators. The newspaper said the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office began the investigation last year after it was tipped by a confidential informant that the group was obtaining non-public information about takeovers from a number of investment banks. including <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. No charges have been filed <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Iason </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s regional administrator in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, declined to comment on the Post story. The enforcement agency ordinarily does not comment on pending investigations. The Post's account suggested that at least part of the investigation overlapped with some of the other highly publicized probes that have stemmed from the <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> insider trading case two years ago. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, once the best-known speculator on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, turned state's evidence after paying the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> a record $ 100 million in penalties for insider trading. He also pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of conspiracy to lie to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and is serving a three-year prison term. The biggest target of <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s cooperation so far has been <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, which is battling major civil-fraud charges by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and may face criminal indictments soon. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has denied any wrongdoing. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said one of the <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> alumni allegedly under investigation is <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> trader indicted a few months ago in a criminal securities and tax fraud case involving a small <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> investment firm. The newspaper account did not identify all the other <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> alumni allegedly subjected to <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> scrutiny, but said four declined to comment and one denied any wrongdoing.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> shareholders will get cash payments of $ 7 per share under a restructuring that will see the sale of the company's <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> and Rodeway hotel businesses and its restaurant operations. In a statement mailed Monday to its shareholders, <PERSON> Ramada </PERSON> provided details of a plan it announced in October to thwart a proposed buy-out by the company's biggest stockholder, the <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. After completing the restructuring, <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> will be left with its casino operations in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which already provide a major share of its operating revenue. `` The purpose of the plan is to enable you to realize a near-term return on your investment and provide you with a continuing stake in <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION>'s profitable gaming business,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Snell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ramada </PERSON> board chairman, in a letter accompanying the statement to stockholders. Ramada stock closed down 37 -LCB- cents a share to $ 8.87 -LCB- in composite <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading on Monday. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> HCC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an affiliate of the <ORGANIZATION> Pritzkers </ORGANIZATION>' Hyatt hotel chain, offered $ 10 a share for Ramada in early September. Ramada rejected the $ 368 million offer as unfair to shareholders. `` It is our firm conviction that a sale of control of the company at this time is not in the best interests of the company, its shareholders and other affected constituents,'' <PERSON> Snell </PERSON> said. Ramada operates <ORGANIZATION> TropWorld </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> and Entertainment Resort in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Tropicana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Resort </LOCATION> and Casino in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Laughlin </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>'s Fabulous'50s in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION> `` We have been successful in our efforts to establish the company as an innovative and efficient operator in the gaming industry,'' <PERSON> Snell </PERSON> told shareholders. `` Our strategy has been to provide something more than gambling. The product we strive to offer to customers is a complete entertainment experience in a gaming environment.'' Al <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, a gaming analyst based in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said the casinos had attracted <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>'s attention. `` Mr. <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> would n't have chased <PERSON> Ramada </PERSON> a few years ago, when it was a neophyte in the casino industry,'' <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> said. `` He's chasing it today because it's matured into a pretty nice-looking product. The information statement mailed to shareholders Monday projects operating income from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> properties at $ 48.5 million in 1989 and $ 74.5 million by 1991. Operating income from the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> properties was projected at $ 29.6 million next year and $ 42.2 million in 1991. Net income was projected by the company at $ 9.4 million in 1989, $ 21.5 million in 1990 and $ 36.8 million in 1991. Ramada reported overall net earnings of $ 4.4 million during the first nine months of 1988, including a net loss of $ 2.6 million for the hotel and restaurant operations. The four gaming facilities posted a profit of $ 7.6 million through September, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> owns <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Callender </PERSON>'s restaurants and owns, operates, franchises or has under contract more than 800 hotels under the <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> and Rodeway brand names. But <PERSON> Snell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ramada </PERSON> remained optimistic about the long-term prospects for the hotel and restaurant groups. `` We feel confident that they will be attractive to prospective purchasers,'' he said. `` Both have well-recognized and established brand names and room in their markets for long-term growth.''

 Having plowed the financial harvest of 1987 into this year's crop, cotton farmers of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> High </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> are expecting to reap bountiful results again this fall. With the harvest in full swing, crop observers are forecasting a total yield of about 2.7 million bales from 3 million acres for the 25-county area that stretches from <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION> in the Panhandle of the state, south to <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. That's slightly below last year's bumper crop of 2.7 million bales from 2.7 million acres, which marked the second-highest per-acre yield on record behind 1965 when slightly more than one bale an acre was harvested. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> leads all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> states in cotton production, and the <LOCATION> High </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> area alone produces more than any state except <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The 1987 crop eased financial burdens on many farmers, allowing them to pay off loans and buy new equipment. Unlike years past, during this growing season they had some money to spend on better fertilizer, more irrigation and pest control. `` People were in a better position to invest a little more in this crop,'' said cotton agronomist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Supak </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've gone through some pretty tough ones. People are still working largely on borrowed money, but it was a little easier to finance this crop because of the better production last year.'' The weather also played a big part in what should be back-to-back crop successes. Warm and dry conditions in October improved yield prospects by about 10 percent over earlier forecasts, say crop observers. As a result, the cotton bolls, or seed pods, matured before a freeze could kill the plants. Area growers could have been tending an even better crop had more rainfall soaked fields during the summer. `` This could have been an exceptional crop, perhaps a record crop, had we caught a rain in August,'' <PERSON> Supak </PERSON> said. `` The dryland cotton went through a pretty severe drought stress. That will put a cap on production.'' Crops in most areas were spared from severe hail damage, which all but devastated the 1986 crop, but drought conditions will cut into the harvest in some areas of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON>, an extension agent in one <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION>, estimated that farmers in his area would bring in only about 8,000 bales over 55,000 acres, compared with 22,000 bales last year. Scant rainfall and boll weevil infestation in the area, where dryland farming predominates, doomed crops early on. `` We did n't have any rain through July, August or September,'' said <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON>. `` The drier it got, the worse the bugs got us, and before we knew it we did n't have any cotton.'' Still, state agriculture officials project that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' cotton crop will be the fourth-largest in 10 years, down about 7 percent from 1987. While cotton experts say the quality of this year's <LOCATION> High </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> cotton has been good so far, market prices have edged lower. `` It appears that the demand for cotton is somewhat weaker now than it was at this time last year, especially the export demand,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ethridge </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s agricultural economics department. `` I also see that there is some weakness in the domestic demand for cotton, and that is certainly affecting the market price.'' <PERSON> Ethridge </PERSON> attributed the weakness in demand to a sluggish economy. But the <LOCATION> High </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> economy should pick up as a result of consecutive bountiful harvests, said L.J. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brownfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` Since agriculture is the base of the economy in <LOCATION> Brownfield </LOCATION> ... it just has a tremendous impact on our local economy and the financial institutions,'' he said. The influx of deposits from last year's crop boosted <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> to a record $ 94 million in assets. `` We expect that when we get this crop in, we'll reach the $ 100 million mark,'' he said. Despite the hopeful outlook, weather-related misfortunes could still befall the cotton before it's out of the field later this month, said <PERSON> Supak </PERSON>. `` What would tend to hurt us would be weather systems that would come in here with ice and snow and moisture,'' he said. `` Cotton is very vulnerable at this stage to weathering and will lose its color if exposed to moisture.''

 Because a Japanese sees red if handed a gift wrapped in white, a pair of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> entrepreneurs are getting a nice reception for their business helping executives select and send presents to associates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad. Seven months ago, <PERSON> Lydia </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klatsky </PERSON> and partner <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> invested $ 40,000 to launch Corporate American Gifts. <PERSON> Klatsky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> bring crafts to executives' offices for selection, advise clients, wrap and ship gifts to domestic or foreign locations. The crafts are one-of-a-kind pieces culled from American artists, whom the two meet during scouting excursions around the country. They attend major craft shows and drop in on artists. `` We feel it's really important that Americans give American gifts abroad,'' <PERSON> Klatsky </PERSON> said. The gifts, which range in price from just under $ 5 to a $ 12,000 library oak table designed by <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Nutt </PERSON>, suit a variety of tastes among both givers and receivers. For conservatives there are hand-made leather binders, exquisite glass paperweights and hand-carved wooden clocks. Tiny executive toy boxes filled with bronze `` toys,'' burl wood boxes with secret compartments and lacquered puzzle cubes with several faces appeal to the more adventuresome. `` Very often the person doing the buying does n't have the time or the inclination to go shopping,'' <PERSON> Klatsky </PERSON> said. But more important for the convenience for some gift-givers is the knowledge <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> and <PERSON> Klatsky </PERSON> have of the customs of other cultures. `` They'll come to your office with appropriate samples after a brief phone conversation in which we identify the nationality of the recipients and other factors which influence the type and value of the gift one wants to provide,'' said <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grahame </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Dexter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Locks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` You have to be careful when purchasing gifts for anyone, particularly for the Japanese,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said, noting that even the color of certain gift wrapping paper can offend particular cultures. For example, white is a color of mourning in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and would be inappropriate as gift wrap, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said, while black or purple wrapping paper would be considered offensive in some Latin American cultures. <PERSON> Klatsky </PERSON>, a registered nurse, and <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, who worked in advertising with her husband, now have among their clients <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cigna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Gerber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. They declined to release sales figures, but said they expected to make a profit in their first year. To develop the savvy necessary to advise buyers, <PERSON> Klatsky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> researched what gifts are appropriate for specific countries, but such information is scarce. <PERSON> Klatsky </PERSON> said she once turned to the White House for advice. Her quest eventually led to the person in charge of presidential gift giving, who acknowledged the dearth of information on the subject and asked <PERSON> Klatsky </PERSON> to forward a Corporate American Gifts catalog when it's finished next spring. `` There are certain countries where one gift is acceptable and another is not,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. `` You do n't give the Japanese anything with a fox or a badger on it. The inference is that foxes are cunning ... and the badger is a scavenger.'' People of various cultures also react differently to expensive gifts. `` Saudi Arabians give very lavishly and you are expected to reciprocate. But you might run into trouble with that in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' where an expensive gift could be perceived as too intimate, <PERSON> Klatsky </PERSON> said. Similarly, in some Latin American countries handkerchiefs are associated with tears and sorrow, the women said. While the concept of fine American crafts appeals to many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies, if left to their own devices executives' good intentions sometimes backfire, the partners note. In one instance recalled by <PERSON> Klatsky </PERSON>, `` a major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> corporation gave clocks to a Japanese company, thinking they were American made, only to discover they were made in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.''

 If the makers of Ruffies are accurate in their view of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, making gains in the garbage bag business is a matter of appealing to the nation's conscience. <ORGANIZATION> Poly-Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, is launching a line of degradable plastic trash bags with hopes that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> households will pay a little extra for Ruffies knowing they have the potential to turn to dust. `` We've gotten just a tremendous response,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Doernbach </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <PERSON> Poly-Tech </PERSON>, a company founded in 1958 by flamboyant philanthropist <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, who sold out in 1969. `` It's going to be interesting to see if people will go out and buy those products.'' It's not the first time degradable garbage bags have been marketed, but <PERSON> Doernbach </PERSON> says <PERSON> Ruffies </PERSON> is the first nationally advertised brand to make the move. `` On their part it's smart marketing,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolfes </PERSON>, a securities analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` I think people like to do the environmentally right thing.'' By adding photo-sensitive material to the plastic compound, the bags break down when they are exposed to ultraviolet light from the sun. Once the chain reaction begins, the bags eventually are reduced to a fine powder, the company says. The bags will completely degrade in about three months in direct sunlight, the company says. But there's a catch. <PERSON> Doernbach </PERSON> said bags must be exposed to the sun a minimum of about seven days for the breakdown process to begin _ give or take a few days depending on seasons and the bag's distance from the equator Given the dark nature of landfills, `` most bags wo n't degrade with the way they are normally used,'' <PERSON> Rolfes </PERSON> said. Still, degradable bags are helpful in the fight against litter and even the darkest landfill ca n't stop the degrading process of a bag once it starts, <PERSON> Doernbach </PERSON> said. The technology will add about a dime to the retail cost of a package of 30 tall kitchen container-sized bags, which vary in price from $ 1.99 to $ 2.69 depending on where they are sold. `` Hopefully, there's some profit there, but it's not a wildly profitable thing,'' <PERSON> Doernbach </PERSON> said. Ruffies, with about 400 employees in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Battleboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, controls about 8 percent of the total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer trash bag market while its two other national competitors _ Glad and Hefty _ each has about a 30 percent share, <PERSON> Doernbach </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Poly-Tech </ORGANIZATION> posted $ 71.8 million in revenues in 1987 but earned just $ 472,000. <PERSON> Rolfes </PERSON> said the degradable bags could give Poly-Tech a small sales edge in some locations, but not enough to make a `` night-and-day difference'' because the product could easily be duplicated by competitors if it skyrockets. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, product manager for Glad trash bags in <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said he's neither surprised nor worried about the change in <LOCATION> Ruffies </LOCATION>. `` This is not a hot button with consumers,'' <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- Poly-Tech -RRB- is responding to special interests.'' <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes Hefty bags, said it's a waste of time and resources to make garbage bags degradable. `` The degrading process takes far, far too long to create extra space in landfills,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. `` The money is much better spent on real solutions to the problems.'' Although plastics only account for an estimated 7.2 percent of the country's solid waste as measured by weight, many experts believe plastics pose a much greater problem than the figures reveal because they are so light. About 9.6 million tons of plastic were discarded in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1984 and the volume is expected to increase 9.8 percent to 15.5 tons by 1990. Recycling, garbage incineration and reducing the stream of solid waste are environmental causes more worthy of corporate concern, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. `` It's a matter of taking care of the volume that we generate and reducing that volume,'' he said. Still, Hefty will be keeping an eye on Ruffies sales to see what consumers want. `` <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s position has been, if the market demands that the bags be made biodegradable we'll do it,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jangula </PERSON> feared this year's drought would force them off their farm, until one of the nation's largest travel agencies moved 20 computer terminals into a vacant local Her part-time bookkeeping jobs did not earn enough, and the alternative was driving 60 miles to <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> each day for a full-time job. `` It was becoming reality that we had to do something,'' before the Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION> Rosenbluth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> opened an office in <PERSON> Linton </PERSON> and hired 40 local farmers and farmwives as data processors, Mrs. <PERSON> Jangula </PERSON> said. The $ 5-an-hour, part-time jobs have helped many families hurt by the drought put food on their tables this fall. `` It's not going to save the farm, but it really helps out,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Jangula </PERSON>, who was hired as coordinator of the office. The agency, for its part, discovered that being a good samaritan can sometimes be good business. By employing farm families to punch customer profile data into computers, the agency thought it could help the farmers survive their misfortune while saving the company money on overtime it was paying elsewhere, said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, the agency's marketing manager. <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbluth </PERSON>, the travel agency's president, `` just decided it was our social responsibility to help,'' she said. The only requirement for employment was that workers be from farm families. `` Because that was where the greatest effect of the drought was going to be felt instantaneously,'' <PERSON> Rosenbluth </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Without any prompting from government, <PERSON> Rosenbluth </PERSON> took it upon himself to find out what his successful travel business could do to improve the lot of the drought-stricken farmers. `` He saw the plight of the people in that area. He realized they were good business people, but that nature had just dealt them a bad hand,'' <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> said. `` He looked at work that needed to be done and said why ca n't those people do it. The <PERSON> Rosenbluth </PERSON> agency is one of the nation's top three corporate and vacation travel agencies and expects more than $ 700 million in sales in 1988, <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> said. It is the official travel agency of some 1,300 major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations, including the <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, E.E. du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television network, and employs 2,000 people at 160 offices in 33 states and abroad, she said. To find out where his company's assistance might be most needed, <PERSON> Rosenbluth </PERSON> contacted the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. After being directed to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, the travel agency hooked up with state and local officials who led <PERSON> Rosenbluth </PERSON> to <PERSON> Linton </PERSON>, population 1,450, and <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>, each with about 1,000 residents. The drought dealt an estimated $ 2.1 billion blow to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s economy, or 10 percent of the state's gross business volume, according to economists at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The state's agricultural sector lost $ 700 million. `` They decided on <PERSON> Linton </PERSON> because they had the type of building best suited for what they wanted to do,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> LeClerc </PERSON>, rural development coordinator for the state's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The 40 workers in <LOCATION> Linton </LOCATION> come from seven towns in a 30-mile area, said Mrs. <PERSON> Jangula </PERSON>, the only full-time employee at the office. The travel agency originally intended to hire 20 full-time workers, but when 90 people applied for the jobs, it decided to hire 40 part-time employees instead, <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> said. `` We decided it would be better to impact 40 families,'' she said. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisser </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Linton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the extra income is helping many of those families survive. `` It's just in some cases the difference of buying groceries or not,'' he said. `` This has really given us a boost in attitude more than anything.'' The agency flew computers and trainers to <PERSON> Linton </PERSON> to open a temporary office Aug. 8 for a three-month trial, <PERSON> Weisser </PERSON> said. The development corportion chipped in $ 1,000 for two months' rent and coaxed local residents to wage a letter-writing campaign to show their interest in keeping the office open, he said. The office did such a good job during the trial period, <PERSON> Rosenbluth </PERSON> quickly decided to make it a permanent addition to the company fold. The travel agency is now the town's fourth biggest employer, surpassed only by the county, school and hospital, according to <PERSON> Weisser </PERSON>. Although the <PERSON> Linton </PERSON> office was the first one his agency has opened that was not requested by a client, it may not be the last, <PERSON> Rosenbluth </PERSON> said. `` What we do is very electronic,'' he said. `` It could be in <LOCATION> Linton </LOCATION>; it could be in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. ... The key is to be where we have some very fine associates.''

<TEXT>
 Behind his ramshackle wooden counter <PERSON> Luiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> Costa sells anything from toilet paper and cigarettes to cooking oil and rice, literally for the price of gold. His prices are calculated in grams of the yellow metal _ one-tenth of a gram -LRB- worth about $ 2 -RRB- for a dozen eggs or a half a gram for 2 pounds of coffee. Costa's customers are part of an estimated 1 million prospectors who have invaded <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s vast <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> rain forest to tap its rich gold deposits. Fortunes are made. But the gold rush also is creating widespread violence, smuggling, tax evasion, health problems, environmental pollution and even the disturbance of primitive Indians. The gold dust, which Costa carefully weighs on his scale, comes from the bed of the <LOCATION> Madeira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> that flows past <LOCATION> Teotonio </LOCATION>, a small prospectors camp 25 miles from <LOCATION> Porto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Velho </LOCATION>, capital of the western jungle state of <LOCATION> Rondonia </LOCATION>, about 2,000 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. `` This is my way of digging for gold,'' said <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION>, a 58-year-old, pot-bellied, toothless man who claimed he was too old to put up with the rough-and-tumble life led by most gold diggers. According to <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Altino </PERSON> <PERSON> Machado </PERSON>, a director of the <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prospectors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, there are close to 3,000 gold-digging sites spread out over the 2 million square miles of the so-called Legal <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>, comprised of the states of <LOCATION> Amapa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Para </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Roraima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maranhao </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Goias </LOCATION>, Acre, <LOCATION> Rondonia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mato </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosso </PERSON> and Amazonas. Since the late 1970s, `` close to 600,000 newcomers have swelled the ranks of the 400,000 professional prospectors who have been working in the region for years. And if you include spinoff services such as food, equipment, transportation and prostitution, the number of people living off the gold rush jumps to 7 million,'' <PERSON> Machado </PERSON> said. Most prospectors were poor peasants fleeing <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s drought-ridden Northeast But over the past few years `` businessmen, doctors and lawyers have also become gold diggers. They make more in six months than in five years behind their desks,'' <PERSON> Machado </PERSON> said. He said a prospector extracts on the average at least 50 grams of gold -LRB- worth about $ 1,000 -RRB- a month. Most work for well-established entrepreneurs who take 70 percent of the production in exchange for equipment, transportation, medicine and food. `` Very few get rich,'' <PERSON> Machado </PERSON> said. But fortunes are made in the jungle. About 5,000 prospectors have earned at least $ 1 million, and some 200 are worth more than $ 5 million, he said. Most of the gold from the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> never finds its way into the national economy. Buyers who purchase the gold directly from the prospectors hoard it or acquire dollars as a hedge against inflation, or smuggle it out of the country to evade income and mineral extraction taxes. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Maron </PERSON>, an official of the Mines and <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mineral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` lack of funds and manpower make it almost impossible to police the vast expanse of land on which the gold digging sites are located.'' In an interview, <PERSON> Maron </PERSON> said that of the estimated 100 tons of gold produced in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> in 1987 `` only 35 tons were registered with the government.'' For 1988, he estimated a `` real production of 110 tons versus a registered production of no more than 55 tons.'' Ministry figures show that between 1977 and 1986 almost $ 23 billion of gold was `` detoured from the economy.'' In terms of real production, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> ranks sixth among the world's largest gold producers coming after <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> <PERSON> Maron </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has known reserves of 1,000 tons of gold. He said geological studies have not been made to pinpoint gold reserves in the Amazons `` but all told I would estimate <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has a potential of producing about 30,000 tons of gold.'' `` A lot of gold is found inside Indian territory. This has led to several conflicts, especially with the <ORGANIZATION> Yanomami </ORGANIZATION> tribe in the northern state of <LOCATION> Roraima </LOCATION>, near the frontier with <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Maron </PERSON> said. Police and army troops occasionally evict prospectors from <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> territory, `` but they keep coming back,'' he said. <PERSON> Machado </PERSON> admitted prospectors work near <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> territory, `` but never invade it. It is the Indians who enter prospectors' camps and dig for gold and they are always welcomed.'' <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> gold comes from huge open-pit mines or is blasted from the earth with high pressure water hoses, pumped from riverbeds or simply panned by solitary prospectors. The most serious environmental hazard posed is the use of mercury, a metallic chemical element used to join gold dust particles. The mercury is burned off the gold, emitting a highly toxic gas that enters the atmosphere and can be inhaled by the prospector. The toxins can cause nervous disorders and genetic deformations in offspring. <PERSON> Maron </PERSON> said 180 tons of mercury enter the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>'s ecosystem every year `` affecting the region's flora and fauna and poisoning the rivers.'' Along a 370-mile stretch of the <LOCATION> Madeira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, some 5,000 dredges daily suck up huge amounts of gravel, which yield more than 4 tons of gold a year. Near the Teotonio prospectors camp, <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliveira </PERSON> employs 16 men on his two dredges, which operate 24 hours a day. Seventy-three feet below, hoses acting like giant vacuum cleaners pump up about 6 tons of gravel per hour. On hundreds of small barges, competing with dredges for space, divers plunge into the dark, muddy waters, hand-carrying smaller versions of the suction hoses. <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lins </PERSON>, 23, dives twice a day. Air, pumped through a tube by an engine on the barge, allows him to remain underwater for two hours at a time. <PERSON> Lins </PERSON>' profession is a dangerous one. He runs the risk of bursting his lungs by getting his air tube tangled with those of other divers or with the dredges' hoses. Divers are also known to cut their rivals' air supplies. `` Scores die this way each year,'' <PERSON> Lins </PERSON> said as he prepared to dive. But it's not only divers who die for gold. Each day at least four people are shot dead in <LOCATION> Teotonio </LOCATION> `` mainly because they did n't obey our unwritten code of ethics,'' said <PERSON> Oliveira </PERSON>. `` Here it's live and let live and work and let work. Anyone who does n't follow this rule dies.'' <PERSON> Machado </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oliveira </PERSON> and other prospectors interviewed denied reports that drug traffickers from neighboring <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> cross frontiers to exchange cocaine for gold. `` But we have information of traffickers buying gold with dollars as part of their money-laundering process,'' <PERSON> Machado </PERSON> said. More than 1,000 gold fever-stricken prospectors enter the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> each year hoping to strike it rich, and according to <PERSON> Machado </PERSON>, `` Very few will leave the jungle, because once you come down with the fever you never want to recover.''

<HEAD>Bipartisan Commission Chairman Says Gasoline Tax Hike Possible</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> told oil industry executives Tuesday that an increase in the gasoline tax could become a reality under the new administration. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, a prominent <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat, said a new tax on gasoline had been discussed as one possible way to help reduce the federal government's huge budget deficit. `` A great many experts feel ... that if indeed additional revenue is needed ... that a gas tax or a broad-based energy tax is something the government should look at very strongly,'' <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> told some 1,500 participants at the closing session of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting. However, <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> declined to say whether he had or would recommend a new gasoline tax to the commission, a bipartisan body formed to make recommendations on reducing the budget deficit. During the three-day meeting, industry leaders have spoken out against new taxes, arguing that the oil industry is the most heavily taxed in the nation. <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> has called the retail gasoline tax the `` single most regressive form of taxation,'' one that would tax the low income most heavily and have a harmful regional impact <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>, who also is chairman of the trade group, said Tuesday that while President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had promised not tol resources, it is more environmentally acceptable than other fossil fuels _ and particularly so in addressing such concerns as ozone, acid rain and the greenhouse effect,'' <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> said.

^By The Associated Press</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines have put off for another week the elimination of a popular category of discount air fares, the so-called `` junk fare'' used by major business travelers. The cuts, which represented an industrywide restructuring of discount fare programs, had been scheduled to take place today. But officials of several carriers said today they had decided to extend the deadline to Nov. 22. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which initiated last Friday the move to eliminate the fares, has extended them for the same period, according to travel agents. Continental spokesmen were unavailable for comment today. `` Other carriers made that move and we simply matched it,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, a spokesman for Dallas-based American. <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said he could not provide an explanation for the postponement. However, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today one reason for the change was that some carriers, including <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, had not yet put the new fares into effect. `` I think all the airlines are watching each other,'' said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornacker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, said the airline had joined in the delay because of confusion among passengers and travel agents over elimination of the discount fare. `` I think passengers became confused and travel agents and we wanted to give time for them to sort these issues out,'' <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said. The fare changes involve the discontinuation of most three - to seven-day advance-purchase fares Besides having the relatively short advance-purchase requirements the so-called junk fares often did not require a traveler to stay at the destination on a Saturday night. They also were between 10 percent to 35 percent below full coach fare.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will need just about as much imported steel next year as this year even if an economic recession reduces overall steel consumption, a leading steel importer said. The requirement for foreign steel will be a central issue in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, as debate heightens over the extent to which President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should renew steel import quotas due to expire next Sept. 30. Domestic producers can not sustain production much above 80 percent of rated capacity, and exports are expected to grow, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamesch </PERSON>, president of the importer <ORGANIZATION> TradeARBED </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and past president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imported </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>. For this year, domestic shipments are expected to reach 83 million tons, imports 21 million tons and exports 2 million tons, leaving total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption of 102 million tons, he said Monday night in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> during an address to members of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distributors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION>. `` Let's assume steel consumption drops five million tons to 97 million tons next year. If, as widely forecast, exports rise by two million tons, we would still need 20 million tons of imported steel in this market. And for specific products and regions, dependence on imported steel is much greater,'' <PERSON> Lamesch </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lamesch </PERSON> said domestic producers can be expected, among other things, to begin filing unfair trade cases as early as spring, as they lobby for an extension of the trade restraint agreements. `` Domestic producers prefer a situation in which the sum of their own capacity plus imports does not surpass a level that will threaten future price stability,'' the importer said. `` In practice that translates into an effort, first to keep closed domestic capacity from being reopened and, second, to extend and expand restraint agreements.''

 Small businesses are feeling better about the economic outlook these days, with an increasing number thinking about adding more jobs, building new plants and maintaining relatively high inventory levels. But do n't expect to see too much in the way of salary increases over the next few months, according to the latest quarterly survey by a leading trade group. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> _ whose 500,000 member firms employ about half the country's non-farm work force _ reports that its small-business optimism index rose to 102.9 in October from 100.5 in July. The seasonally adjusted index, which assumes conditions that existed in 1978 equal 100, reached a high of 108.7 in January 1984 and a low of 81.1 in April 1980. Earlier this year it had been slippping. `` Firms had become decidedly less optimistic about future economic growth during the year,'' explained <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s business school and originator of the survey. `` But the declines of early 1988 were reversed in October ... returning to levels that prevailed in 1986 and early 1987.'' The data compiled in the survey of 2,084 small responding businesses includes predictions on expected business conditions, the climate for expansion, earnings, job openings and hiring plans and plans for capital outlays. <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> said the overall sentiment of responding firms could be summed up this way: `` There is still no sign that there is substantial weakness in the economy or that a recession is likely to start anytime before mid-1989. `` Strong earnings are supporting strong plans to hire and spend on inventories and capital projects.'' Among details of the report: _ Eighteen percent of the firms plan to increase total employment in the next three months, while 11 percent plan reductions The percentage of firms with job openings set a record for the current expansion, rising to 25 percent and surpassing the previous high of 23 percent last January. `` The employment rate should continue to fall under such pressure,'' the report said. _ Twenty-nine percent reported raising prices in the third quarter, unchanged from the previous period, while 8 percent reduced prices, down two percentage points from July Plans to lift prices fell one percentage point from July levels, to 25 percent of all firms. `` Although not large, there is a clear upward drift in the percent of firms planning to raise prices. -LRB- But -RRB- ... non-food inflation should fall off somewhat in the fourth quarter,'' the report said. _ Planned capital outlays rose to an all-time seasonally adjusted high of 35 percent Fifty-five percent reported outlays in the last six months, although the spending rate is still nine percentage points below the high level set in 1979. _ Plans to add to inventories were unchanged from July levels, but remained strong in comparison to the past four years Seventeen percent planned to add to inventories, while 17 percent planned to reduce. `` Accumulations have been heavy among retail and wholesale firms, perhaps in anticipation of the Christmas selling season,'' the report said. _ The percentage of firms borrowing on a regular basis rose to 38 percent from a record-low 35 percent of all firms `` Apparently profits and cash flow are sufficient to meet he capital needs of most small firms.'' _ Twenty-six percent reported increases in employee wages in the third quarter of 1988, up one percentage point from the previous period Plans to increase wages rose three percentage points to 21 percent of firms. `` With job openings at expansion-high levels, there is still little evidence that compensation is responsiding in any substantive way to labor market tightness,'' the report said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> reported that its profit declined 2 percent in its second quarter as its 1987 acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caledonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> continued to reduce earnings. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest airline said Tuesday that its net profit in the three months ended Sept. 30 fell to 91 million pounds, or around $ 165 million, from 93 million pounds, or $ 168 million, a year earlier. Per-share earnings slipped to 12.6 pence, or 23 cents, from 12.9 pence, or 23 cents at prevailing exchange rates. The decline occurred despite a 12 percent rise in second-quarter revenue, to 1.19 billion pounds, or $ 2.2 billion, from 1.06 billion pounds, or $ 1.9 billion. The latest quarterly results for the airline were in line with most analysts' forecasts. In the first six months of its fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>' profit fell 5 percent to 144 million pounds, or $ 261 million, from 151 million pounds, or $ 273 million Per-share earnings declined to 20 pence, or 36 cents, from 20.9 pence, or 38 cents. Half-year revenue rose 13 percent to 2.21 billion pounds, or $ 4 billion, from 1.96 billion pounds, or $ 3.5 billion. Results for the former British Caledonian operations, acquired by <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> last year for 253 million pounds, or $ 458 million, were included in the figures for the current fiscal year but not in those of the previous year. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> Chairman Lord <PERSON> King </PERSON> said second-quarter results from most market segments were satisfactory but that there was a disappointing performance from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and British operations. `` The winter months are our most vulnerable period,'' he said. `` However, present -LRB- passenger -RRB- traffic levels remain high for this time of year and our forward bookings are ahead of last year.''

 Share prices drifted higher Tuesday in uninspired dealings on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 8 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,802.3. Volume was 341.8 million shares, compared with the 479.9 million shares traded Monday. Some selected shares were energized by takeover talk, dealers said, but added that they saw few substantive moves in prices. `` Institutions are still out of the game and without them, we ca n't expect to cover much territory,'' one trader said. Dealers said they were encouraged by the fact that the index managed to close above the psychologically important 1,800 level.

 Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as a late round of speculative selling sent soybean and corn prices down sharply. Prices were weak throughout the session amid bearish chart signals and disappointment over the relatively slow pace of grain exports.

<TEXT>
 A majority of the nation's small-business owners believe the federal budget deficit is the No. 1 issue facing President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and they favor spending cuts to reduce the shortfall, a poll said Tuesday. The 21,000 entreprenuers responding to <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s third annual Small Business Survey also expressed general optimism about the economic outlook despite the lingering budgetary problems Two-thirds of those polled said the deficit was the most pressing issue of the day. Forty-five percent listed tax rates, 26 percent domestic programs, 25 percent foreign policy and 15 percent defense spending. The respondents were asked to pick the two most important political issues facing the incoming administration. Spending cuts were picked by 55 percent of those surveyed as the best solution to the deficit problem, while 44 percent favored both spending cuts and increased taxes. `` Emerging and owner-managed businesses appear to see taxes as both a concern and a reality,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Halloran </PERSON>, an <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> partner. `` To reduce our deficit, most small businesses prefer a reduction in spending by cutting defense spending, welfare and foreign aid.'' As far as the economy was concerned, 60 percent of the respondents predicted they would record at least a 5 percent gain in sales in the upcoming year, with 35 percent foresaw an increase of more than 10 percent. Three-fourths estimated profits would stay the same or increase over last year. `` In past studies, the executives' predictions have been right on target because they are aware of their competitive environment and the pressures facing small business, and are committed to setting and reaching optimistic goals,'' <PERSON> O'Halloran </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, is one of the world's largest accounting and tax consultants.

 Stock prices creaked to a mixed finish today in a particularly slow session, reflecting widespread reluctance to participate ahead of the government's potentially market-jolting monthly trade report. `` The only thing I've noticed is nothing's happened,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicoski </PERSON>, a technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hopwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Minneapolis-based investment firm. `` Everybody's just waiting to see what those numbers are going to do.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is due to report the September merchandise trade balance Wednesday morning and most expectations are for a $ 10.5 billion shortfall. If the deficit exceeds that amount, some fear it could trigger a selloff in the dollar, stock and bond markets. The trade statistics vary widely from month to month but remain one of the most sensitive market movers. That's largely because the huge trade deficits the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been racking up over the past several years are seen by many economists as a reflection of eroding economic might. Wall Street strategists said other figures released today that showed higher retail sales and industrial production in October caused little reaction in the market.

 <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its third-quarter earnings declined 6.7 percent, while <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its income rose 35 percent during the period and <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 5.6 percent earnings gain for its first quarter <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> said its third-quarter earnings declined to $ 160 million from $ 171 million in the same period a year earlier. <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>'s per-share earnings increased to $ 1.17 from $ 1.14 as it had 13 percent fewer shares outstanding in the latest quarter <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> attributed some of the earnings decline to accounting changes. The company said its revenue totaled $ 3.61 billion, down from $ 3.76 billion a year earlier. The retail industry has been struggling through a slump that began in February 1987. Some companies, like <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>, are still showing profit declines. Other companies have showed earnings gains, but securities analysts caution that the results, when compared with last year's depressed numbers, may look stronger than they really are. <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said it earned $ 45.6 million, or 54 cents per share, in the quarter ended Oct. 29, up from $ 33.6 million, or 34 cents per share, in the comparable period a year ago. Third-quarter revenue increased to $ 2.87 billion from $ 2.54 billion for the same period in 1987. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Macke </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, said sales at its <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON>'s department stores strengthened during the quarter because of improved inventory content. <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON>'s has been a trouble spot for <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> in the past. The company also owns <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION>'s and <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s department stores and Target discount stores. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said it had earnings of $ 11.3 million, or 52 cents a share, during its first quarter, compared with $ 10.7 million, or 49 cents per share in the same period a year ago. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said it had a $ 4 million operating loss in the latest quarter. The company, parent of the Broadway, <PERSON> Emporium </PERSON> <PERSON> Capwell </PERSON>, Thalheimers and <PERSON> Weinstock </PERSON>'s department stores, said sales were $ 636.7 million in the quarter, up from $ 610.6 million in the same period a year earlier. For the first nine months of the year, <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> said it earned $ 372 million, or $ 2.74 per share, compared with $ 328 million, or $ 2.18 a share, in the comparable 1987 period.

<HEAD>Industry Facing Serious Energy Problems, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Falling energy prices and rising profits at many oil companies are concealing more serious industrywide problems that a national energy policy must address, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` The truth is that the state of the nation's energy health today is perceived as ` good' only because enough inexpensive foreign oil is available,'' the industry's main trade group said in a report. `` Our condition could turn to ` poor' or ` critical' if that supply were disrupted ...'' The report, `` Energy Security White Paper: <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Decisions and Global Trends,'' was issued during the group's annual meeting. The survival of domestic exploration and production is in question as lower crude prices discourage investment in new oil development, the report said. Dependence on foreign oil, primarily from the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, has increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vulnerability to the dangers of a supply disruption and price volatility, it said. Despite recent huge quarterly profits by major oil companies, the gains came in `` downstream'' sectors such as refining and chemical manufacturing, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBona </PERSON>, president of the trade group. But the favorable earnings were offset at least partly by losses in `` upstream'' _ production and exploration operations _ stemming from low crude prices. The paper calls for a national energy policy to ensure an adequate and secure supply of oil at reasonable prices while reducing vulnerability to a future oil crisis. The report does not specifically call for tax incentives to help offset the crude prices, but contends correct `` government decisions'' could increase domestic oil supply by 2 million barrels a day by the end of the 1990s. Only 921 oil rigs are working in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, compared with about 1,000 a year ago and 4,000 in 1981, the group noted. Those rigs are producing approximately 8 million barrels of oil a day and output is falling 3 percent a year while demand is rising about 2 percent annually, the report said. Consequently, foreign imports have soared to 43 percent from 31 percent just three years ago and some economists predict that in five years the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may be importing half of its oil. The report said dependence on foreign supplies, primarily from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vulnerability to a supply disruption. With demand increasing rapidly, the current glut of oil on world markets could dry up in the 1990s, the report said. `` Then any number of unpredictable developments around the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> could directly, swiftly and critically affect oil supply,'' the paper said. In addition, another steep plunge in oil prices, like that which occurred in 1986, threatens the survival of smaller oil companies, damages the economies of oil states dependent on the industry for revenue and `` hurts the country's long-term energy security,'' the report said.

 A magistrate issued arrest warrants Tuesday for former <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and two other company officials to answer murder charges in the 1984 gas disaster that killed 3,100 people. The prosecutor sought the warrants after <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and other executives of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company failed to respond to summonses issued in December. `` They are deliberately trying to disobey the court of law,'' government prosecutor <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON> said. A spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said Indian courts had no jurisdiction over <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> or the company. `` <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is not an Indian corporation,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Slack </PERSON>, the company's assistant director of corporate communications. `` It has no presence in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and under Indian law can have no presence in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>.'' The charges are in addition to a still-unresolved $ 3 billion damage suit filed against <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> and its Indian subsidiary by the Indian government. The Indian government argues the leak was a result of negligence. `` We believe that the energy expended in the pursuit of ill-founded criminal charges in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to be more productively invested in getting aid to the victims or in revealing evidence that would confirm that the tragedy was caused by sabotage,'' Slack said. The <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> pesticide plant, where toxic gas leaked out of a tank and wafted over nearby shantytowns, was operated by <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, in which <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> holds a 50.9 percent stake. The remaining stock is owned by Indian interests. In addition to 3,185 deaths counted by the government, more than 20,000 people were injured when they inhaled the lethal methyl isocyanate. The Indian government filed its damage suit in early 1986. Last year, the government filed the separate murder charges against <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, its <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong-based </LOCATION> subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and eight officers of the Indian subsidiary. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> retired in late 1986 after reaching the company's mandatory retirement age, of 65. The only arrest warrants issued Tuesday were for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON>, attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Neither <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> was named in the murder charges. <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON>, the prosecutor, said he sought warrants for <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> because they were the people who took receipt of the summonses issued to their firms. <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON> also said the Indian government might start extradition proceedings if the trio ignored the arrest warrants. In granting the request for arrest warrants, chief judicial magistrate R.C. <PERSON> Mishra </PERSON> said the three men could be released on $ 1,000 bail apiece if they appeared in court. <PERSON> Mishra </PERSON> is not hearing any actual trial cases, but his job empowers him to preside over some procedural matters, such as failure to answer summonses and whether to commit a case to trial by a higher court.

 Some people in the computer industry mistakenly blame computer `` viruses'' for anything that goes wrong, an independent computer security consultant says. `` Out of over 1,400 complaints to the <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> this year, in only 2 percent of the cases was an electronic virus the cause of the problem,'' <PERSON> Chrles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. `` People are jumping to the conclusion that whenever a system slows down, it's a virus that's responsible.'' Wood and other panelists at a 15th annual computer security conference cautioned that computer-dependent companies should focus more on the day-to-day breakdowns caused by human error than on the kind of virus introduced recently into a government-supported computer network. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a 23-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate student, allegedly unleashed the virus in the nationwide 6,200-computer government-supported network called Arpanet. He is the subject of an inquiry by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys in two states. That incident `` could be a cheap lesson,'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> LeeMah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Datacom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. `` We were lucky because it was not a real malicious attempt ... If <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> had ordered the programs to be erased, the loss could have gone into billions, lots of zeroes.'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said: `` The virus is the hot topic right now, but actually the real important subject is disaster recovery planning. But that's not as glamorous as the viruses.

 The Farmers Home Administration began mailing thousands of notices Tuesday to farmers who are past due on loans, and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> vowed to scrutinize the post-election timing of the move. Agency spokesman <PERSON> Marlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> said about 83,500 letters would be mailed through Nov. 25. The agency had said earlier that 90,000 letters would be sent in an effort to collect $ 8.8 billion in past-due loans, but <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> said some had since been paid up. The collection effort comes under rules implementing new credit legislation. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, accused the FmHA of holding the letters back until after the Nov. 8 presidential election for `` political reasons,'' although the agency had the letters in hand `` well before the election.'' `` That is no way to administer a program that is so important to our nation's farmers, and it is no way to treat the 6,500 or so Texans who are getting the letters,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who was the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee for vice president. `` The Farm Credit Act of 1987, legislation on which I worked long and hard, may give us the means to restructure some of the overdue loans so that we do not push farmers into foreclosure unnecessarily,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` That is where I will focus my attention in the days ahead. I urge the Farmers Home Administration to do the same.'' FmHA is considered the farm lender of last resort because it makes loans only to those who can not qualify at banks or other commercial sources. Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democrat </LOCATION> and member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he was `` certain that the actions of the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> will be scrutinized by both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> agriculture committees with an eye toward whether <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> has carried out both the letter and the intent of the 1987 Agriculture Credit Act.'' The letters inform borrowers who are more than 180 days late of their options. The notices explain that <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> borrowers must notify the agency within 45 days if they intend to apply to make arrangements for settling their debts. Details regarding the options, including debt restructuring and writeoffs, will be provided. Congress in the Farm Credit Act ordered <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> to revise its lending practices, with the debt write-down considered one of the most important parts of the law. It allows FmHA to reduce a farmer's delinquent debt to the recovery value of the collateral, which is usually land or farm equipment, depending upon cash flow and other factors

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar edged downward Tuesday in uncertain trading in advance of Wednesday's report on the nation's merchandise trade deficit for the month of September Gold prices rose. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold bullion was bid at $ 423.00 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $ 422.85 late Monday. Forecasts of the trade deficit ranged widely from $ 9 billion to $ 11 billion. Traders said any number above the range would be likely to drive the dollar lower, while a figure below the range probably would spark a rally. `` Eight or 12 -LRB- billion dollars -RRB- is clearly going to move the markets,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyski </PERSON>, a portfolio manager of <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Trade deficits and the markets' reaction to them are notoriously difficult to predict. Currency dealers said sentiment toward the dollar is predominantly bearish, and any rally caused by a good trade number might be quickly swamped by a wave of selling. The trade deficit in August was $ 12.2 billion. Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was slightly helped Tuesday by the government's report of a rise of 0.9 percent in retail sales in October, the biggest increase in seven months. Strong economic growth attracts investors to dollar-denominated securities. The market shrugged off a 0.4 percent advance in industrial production in October, which fell within expectations, traders said. In contrast to other recent sessions, there were no reports of intervention by central banks to support the dollar against other currencies. The dollar had rallied on Monday on the strength of central-bank purchases and reassuring statements from officials of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 123.25 Japanese yen from 123.00 yen Monday. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar traded higher at 123.40 yen. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to 123.23 yen from 123.75 yen Monday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound fell to $ 1.8060 from $ 1.8090 late Monday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound rose to $ 1.8083 from $ 1.8074. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Monday, included: 1.7433 West German marks, down from 1.7465; 1.4626 Swiss francs, down from 1.4665; 1.2337 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2313; 5.9535 French francs, down from 5.9635; and 1,297.00 Italian lire, down from 1,300.25. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Monday, included: 1.7465 West German marks, up from 1.7452; 1.4630 Swiss francs, down from 1.4645; 5.9660 French francs, up from 5.9615; 1.9685 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9735; 1,300.50 Italian lire, down from 1,303.50, and 1.2344 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2297. Gold prices moved higher, but traders said there was n't enough interest in the metal to sustain a big rise. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at $ 424.07 a troy ounce, up from $ 422.51 an ounce late Monday. Gold closed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at $ 423.75 a troy ounce, up from $ 420.95 late Monday. The late Zurich price was $ 423.00 an ounce, up from $ 420.00. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery rose to $ 424.40 a troy ounce from $ 423.90 at Monday's close. Silver bullion rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to $ 6.41 a troy ounce, up from $ 6.39 late Monday. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell to $ 6.368 a troy ounce from $ 6.418 an ounce Monday.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> computer company controlled by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON> launched an unsolicited takeover offer on Tuesday for the much larger <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> that values Prime at $ 970 million. <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which already owns 4.1 percent of Prime's 48.5 million outstanding shares, is offering shareholders $ 20 a share for the remainder of the stock The bid comes about 11 months after Natick-based Prime launched a hostile bid for <ORGANIZATION> Computervision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> manufacturer of computer-aided design, or CAD, systems which it eventually acquired for $ 435 million. Prime's stock remained below the offering price, rising $ 1.87 -LCB- a share to $ 17.75 a share in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. MAI Basic fell $ 1 a share to $ 11.37 -LCB- a share. `` This is unusual, one computer company trying to acquire another computer company,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Daratech </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> research firm. `` We do not see this as a technological fit or a customer fit. It has to do with benefit to stockholders.'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> also suggested that in making the offer, MAI Basic may inspire other offers for Prime. MAI Basic, based in <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, may be looking to be acquired by the company itself, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dexheimer </PERSON>, an investment banker with <ORGANIZATION> Broadview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, also said MAI Basic's bid appeared to be purely for financial gain. `` It's a straight, smart financial move,'' said <PERSON> Dexheimer </PERSON>. `` The question now is, does he -LRB- LeBow -RRB- really want to go ahead with it?'' <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON> owns 43 percent of <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION>'s stock with an associate, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weksel </PERSON>. <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON> also controls <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and recently asked the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for clearance to buy more than 50 percent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Both Prime and MAI Basic Four are manufacturers of midrange business computers. Prime is now a leading supplier of integrated computer-aided design and computer-aided engineering systems, having recently agreed to acquire <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Calma </ORGANIZATION> unit, a CAD systems maker. That acquisition makes Prime second only to <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in the CAD market. The offer is contingent upon MAI Basic getting at least 67 percent of Prime's outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis. MAI Basic has said that it has filed a lawsuit against Prime and its board in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seeking to block Prime's shareholder rights plan, a defense against unwelcome takeovers The company has also sued Prime in a federal court in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> seeking relief with regard to certain <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> state takeover laws. MAI Basic said it had lined up financing from <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> are the dealer-managers for the offer For the nine months ended Oct. 3, Prime earned $ 33.4 million, or 69 cents a share, on revenue of $ 1.16 billion. For the nine months ended June 30, MAI Basic had net income of $ 18.7 million, or $ 1.25 a share, on revenue of $ 302.9 million. <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON> informed <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer, of the bid in a telephone call Monday night, according to <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavaghan </PERSON>, a spokesman for Prime.

 Stocks advanced marginally Tuesday and volume fell to the lowest level in seven weeks, reflecting investor reluctance to participate ahead of the government's potentially market-jolting monthly trade report. Brokers said buying was largely limited to the components of the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average, which finished with a 12.09 gain to 2,077.17, snapping a four-session losing streak. Most broader market barometers nudged higher. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was due to report the September merchandise trade balance Wednesday morning and most expectations were for a $ 10.5 billion shortfall. If the deficit number substantially exceeds that amount, some fear it could trigger a selloff in the dollar, stock and bond markets. `` Everybody's just waiting to see what those numbers are going to do,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicoski </PERSON>, a technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hopwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Minneapolis-based investment firm. Although the huge trade deficits racked up by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can vary widely from month to month, they remain one of the most powerful market movers and have become a symbol of American economic weakness. Despite widespread reluctance by investors to participate in the stock market ahead of the trade-number release, some Wall Street strategists said the conditions have been laid for some gains over the next several days. `` I think barring something totally unforeseen in terms of a negative trade number, we're setting ourselves up for a fairly significant rally,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>, executive vice president and director of equity research at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` There's been a lot of liquidation over the last week or so by traders and a good deal of skepticism in the market,'' he said. `` That's a potent combination for stocks to go up.'' Others were more cautious, based on technical analyses that showed a lack of demand for stocks. `` We're oversold enough to give us a pop, but based on breadth, I really do n't think we'll get much to the upside,'' <PERSON> Nicoski </PERSON> said. Advancing issues barely outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 715 up, 709 down and 534 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> floor totaled 115.17 million shares, down from 142.90 million in the previous session. It was the lowest level of trading since a 113.72 million-share day Sept. 28. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 137.24 million shares.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Plunge Despite Continuing Strike in Peru</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Copper futures prices plummeted Tuesday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as edgy speculators ignored bullish supply-and-demand factors and sold heavily on fears that the market had topped. On other markets, precious metals were mixed; grains and soybeans were lower; livestock and meat futures were mostly higher; energy futures retreated; and stock-index futures advanced. The miners' strike in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, the world's sixth-largest copper producer, entered its fifth week with no hint of a settlement but most futures traders sold the market anyway. Copper settled 2.7 cents to 6.1 cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 1.299 a pound and the spot November contract at $ 1.369 a pound, about 17 cents below the record high of $ 1.538 reached Nov. 2. `` The market is caught in the throes of bearish sentiment,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Anagnos </PERSON>, metals market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` It's sort of like a snowball going down a hill,'' <PERSON> Anagnos </PERSON> said. `` It tends to gain momentum to the downside.'' The sell-off was sparked by weakening technical signals, the chart patterns followed by many speculators, he said. As more people sold, prices kept falling to levels that triggered further selling. But <PERSON> Anagnos </PERSON> noted that last year's extraordinary copper rally, which saw prices hit $ 1.46 a pound on New Year's Eve, included a 20-cent correction, so the price slide of the past two weeks was not unprecedented. `` This does n't indicate the market is incapable of resuming its upside move,'' he said. `` The fundamental situation to me still portends upward prices.'' In addition to the Peruvian strike, bullish fundamentals include tight supplies and strong demand for copper, which is heavily used for construction and by almost every industry. Gold futures rose slightly but silver prices fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Gold settled 40 cents to 60 cents higher with December at $ 425.60 a troy ounce; silver was 5 cents to 5.2 cents lower with December at $ 6.393 a troy ounce. Soybean futures prices settled at a 3 -LCB- - month low on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on a late round of speculative selling Corn also finished sharply lower while wheat futures were mixed. Prices were weak all session amid bearish chart signals and disappointment over the relatively slow pace of grain exports. Even the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement late Monday of a 300,000-metric-ton corn sale to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> did not rally the corn market, which was expecting a Soviet corn purchase of up to 2 million metric tons. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON>, manager of CBOT floor operations for <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said most of the selling was done by speculators while the outnumbered buyers were largely commercial traders. `` There's just not enough cash business right now to support these price levels,'' <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON> said. `` And if you ca n't go up, you've got to go down. Wheat settled 7 cents lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 4.13 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 5 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.66 a bushel; oats were 3 -RCB- cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with December at $ 2.10 a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 15 -LCB- cents lower with November at $ 7.43 -LCB- a bushel. Cattle futures settled sharply higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, buoyed by improving cash markets and strong buying by commercial players, analysts said. Pork futures enjoyed some spillover support from the adjacent cattle pits but gains were limited by expectations of lower cash prices on Wednesday and concerns about the rapid buildup of pork bellies in cold storage. Live cattle settled .70 cent to 1.25 cents higher with December at 73.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45 cent to 1.30 cents higher with November at 82.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .27 cent lower to .38 cent higher with December at 41.05 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .40 cent higher with February at 44.87 cents a pound. Oil futures prices drifted lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in dull, directionless trading, reversing the gains of the previous session. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 32 cents to 37 cents lower with December at $ 13.90 a barrel; heating oil was .23 cent to .69 cent lower with December at 44.40 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .55 cent to 1.20 cents lower with December at 46.96 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures posted modest gains on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for December delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 settled .65 point higher at 269.50.

 A divided federal appeals court on Tuesday refused to oust <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> from presiding over the civil insider trading case against investment giant <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In a 2-to-1 decision, the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> declined to intervene and remove <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> over an alleged conflict of interest. The Wall Street firm did not immediately say whether it will appeal further. But the decision was welcomed by officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which brought the massive civil-fraud case against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> more than two months ago. `` Naturally we're pleased,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goelzer </PERSON>, general counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We did n't feel that Judge <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> was required to recuse -LRB- disqualify -RRB- himself and the court agreed with us.'' <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has claimed that it is playing a key role in financing the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Palais </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Houston-based retailing company in which <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>'s wife <LOCATION> Moselle </LOCATION> is a major stockholder. Although she has no direct relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> stands to gain about $ 35 million in the transaction. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and other defendants, including <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s high-yield bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, have contended that their connection to the judge's wife creates an appearance of partiality by <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> toward them. They have requested another judge that would make the case free of any possible taint. In sometimes heated court sessions, <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, an 82-year-old jurist with a pro-government reputation, balked at stepping aside, calling the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> move an `` illusionary diversion.'' Other lawyers familiar with the case have called the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> move a tactical strategy to get another judge because of fear by defense attorneys that <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> would rule harshly against the firm. `` We conclude that an objective observer knowing and understanding all the facts and circumstances could not reasonably question Judge <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>'s impartiality,'' wrote Circuit Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardamone </PERSON>, with Judge <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> concurring. But Judge <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lumbard </PERSON> disagreed in a sharply worded dissenting opinion, saying: `` It is clear to me that a reasonable person knowing these ultimate conceded facts would reasonably question Judge <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>'s ability to supervise such litigation impartially. `` Such a reasonable person's next question would be ` Why has n't the judge stepped aside? Moreover, Judge <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>'s expressed resentment to the suggestion of recusal and his castigation of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and its counsel has confirmed these doubts. He can not act impartially in these cases,'' <PERSON> Lumbard </PERSON> wrote. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> said `` we naturally are disappointed with today's decision in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. We have not yet had an opportunity to review it, and we will be doing so in the next few days.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filed a 184-page civil fraud complaint against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and three other employees Sept. 7, accusing them of trading on inside information, cheating clients, manipulating stock, keeping phony books and other violations. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> also claimed <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> used the organization of convicted takeover speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> as a front for its alleged illegal activities. The defendants have denied any wrongdoing.

 Car and light truck sales by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers rose 14.9 percent in early November compared with results a year ago that were depressed by the absence of buyer incentives. The seven manufacturers assembling cars and light trucks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said Tuesday they sold 295,497 vehicles during the Nov. 1-10 period this year, compared with 228,665 vehicles during the same time last year. That amounted to a 14.9 percent increase in the daily sales rate. There were nine selling days during the period this year and eight last year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers have sold 10,190,150 vehicles in 1988, a 7.6 percent increase over the 9,437,194 sold during the Jan. 1-Nov. 10 period last year There have been 266 selling days so far this year, one more than at the same time last year. `` That's very olid,'' analyst <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said of the sales figures. `` Our outlook calls for continued moderate steady growth without any ripples.'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON>, an auto analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said, `` The'89 model year is starting off very, very well.'' Part of the reason for the increase in year-to-year sales was a lack of incentives in early November last year. The super-low financing and big cash-back offers of last summer ended with the 1987 model year on Sept. 30, 1987. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported they sold 172,325 cars during the Nov. 1-10 period this year compared with 130,062 during the same period last year, a 17.8 percent daily sales increase. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> recorded the largest period-to-period increase, selling 57,275 cars in early November this year, compared with 40,877 during the same period last year, a 24.5 percent rise in the daily sales rate. Since New Year's Day, the nation's No. 2 automaker has sold 1,923,078 cars, a 9.4 percent increase from the 1,750,770 it had sold during the same period last year. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, the industry's sales volume leader, sold 88,238 cars during the first 10 days of this month, a 16.4 percent rise in daily sales over the 67,364 cars it sold during the same time last year. For the calendar year, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has sold 0.7 percent more cars in 1988 than 1987, rising to 3,167,132 cars this year from 3,133,795 last year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's No. 3 carmaker, said it sold 26,812 cars in the Nov. 1-10 period this year, compared with 21,821 cars sold during the same time last year _ a 9.2 percent increase in daily sales. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> also said it has sold 930,457 cars so far in 1988, a 11.7 percent increase over the 829,958 cars it had sold between Jan. 1-Nov. 10 of last year

<HEAD>Virulent Citrus Canker Suspected in Central Florida</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A virulent form of citrus canker may have been detected again in a commercial grove in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, state Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> announced Tuesday. The area in <LOCATION> Manatee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> already is under restriction because of previous discoveries of citrus canker A strain in 1986, the announcement read. The discovery was only the second time the canker has been found in a commercial <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grove in recent years. State and federal plant pathologists `` are conducting extensive tests on suspicious samples taken from navel orange, red and pink grapefruit and <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON> orange trees,'' said a release by <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>'s office In the meantime, officials are surveying the area around the suspect groves to take action if the tests prove positive, <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said. There was no response to a telephone call to the agriculture department seeking elaboration on the announcement, which was made late Tuesday afternoon. After canker was detected in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1984, federal authorities declared a temporary embargo on citrus shipments, and the state burned an estimated 20 million citrus trees. The state has since been ordered to pay the owners of many of the trees who argued that agriculture authorities acted too hastily in destroying many groves not affected by canker A meeting of the joint state-federal <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has been called for Friday in <LOCATION> Palmetto </LOCATION> to recommend regulatory measures, <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said. The canker tentatively has been identified as the A strain, the release said. `` Considered one of the more virulent strains of the disease, it can spread rapidly, producing premature fruit drop as well as stem, fruit and leaf lesions,'' <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said. The A strain was discovered in the summer of 1986 on residential trees on <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> and in one commercial grove in Manatee. Since those discoveries, movement of citrus in <LOCATION> Manatee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> counties has been strictly regulated. A total of 3,600 infected trees have been discovered to date in those areas, <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said.

 The rate of occupational injuries and disease is on the rise again, with more than 6 million cases last year, including 351,000 more injuries and 53,000 more illnesses than in 1986, the government said Tuesday. A 5 percent jump in the incidence of job-related illnesses and injuries, from 79 per every 1,000 workers in 1986 to 83 per 1,000 workers last year was the first increase since 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> blamed the increase on a `` lack of enforcement'' of federal safety standards and regulations by the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. However, directors of <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> said at least part of the increase can be attributed to better record-keeping brought about in part by stiff fines against companies that under-report job accidents to the government. Meanwhile, job-related fatalities in surveyed private businesses with 11 or more employees dropped from 3,610 in 1986 to 3,400 last year, a decrease that <ORGANIZATION> BLS </ORGANIZATION> officials called `` statistically insignificant.'' A total of 5,843,100 on-the-job injuries were reported last year, compared with 5,492,000 in 1986. Nearly half of the injuries were serious enough to cost a full day or more of work, and the number of workdays lost totaled 48.8 million, compared with 45.4 million workdays lost to injuries in 1986. About 190,000 workers _ nearly 39 percent more than in 1986 _ suffered job-related illnesses in 1987, most of them noise-related hearing losses, skin diseases and repetitive motion ailments such as carpal tunnel syndrome, prevalent in the meatpacking industry. The bureau said chronic and long-term latent cases that are often difficult to recognize or relate to the workplace are included in the illness statistics `` but are clearly understated.'' Labor Statistics Commissioner <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON> said the increase in the job injury and illness rates may be due to better record-keeping resulting from new government guidelines and intensive efforts to improve the statistics. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> BLS </ORGANIZATION> last year trained some 14,000 representatives from companies employing a total of 20 million people on keeping accurate injury and illness records. The training plus a crackdown by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> on recordkeeping violations followed several years of complaints that companies were under-reporting illnesses and accidents as a way of avoiding <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> inspections. Among others, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> last year questioned the validity of the government's job health and safety data because of `` severe under-reporting'' by employers. An academy panel said the actual number of job-related fatalities could be as much as triple those reported by the bureau. During the first five years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> targeted its inspectors on plants with higher-than-average injury and illness rates. Critics said that merely gave employers an incentive to under-report them. However, in the past two years, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> has levied hundreds of fines, some of them in the millions of dollars, against manufacturers for not reporting job-related injuries or illnesses. `` Over the short run, improved reporting will mean higher injury and illness rates,'' said Assistant Labor Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>. `` But over the long run it should improve workplace conditions.'' <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Factor </PERSON>, an industrial hygienist for the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged that part of the increase is likely due to better records. But she said job-related illnesses and injuries are still severely under-reported, particularly in high-hazard industries like logging and agriculture where <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> has not targeted its enforcement resources. `` Workmen's compensation data from several states, which is not dependent on employers' record-keeping, also show substantial increases in injuries,'' Ms. Factor said. `` In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, for example, the workmen's comp data show a 15 percent increase last year in construction injuries.'' The BLS data show a decline in construction injuries and illnesses, from 152 per every 1,000 workers in 1986 to 147 per 1,000 last year. In every other industry, the incidence rate was either the same or higher last year. Of the 3,400 reported on-the-job fatalities last year, two-thirds occurred in the construction, manufacturing, transportation or public utility industries. As in previous years, the single biggest cause was traffic accidents, accounting for about one-third of the deaths, the government said. The highest incidence of injuries continued to be the lumber and wood products industry, at 186 per 1,000 workers, the same rate as 1986. Second was the metal industry with an injury rate of 163 per 1,000 workers, up from 133 per 1,000 a year earlier.

<HEAD>Merv Griffin Becomes New Owner of Resorts International</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Entertainer <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> became the new owner of <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, taking control from developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> after months of haggling with financiers and gaming regulators. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> paid $ 96 million for <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s controlling block of Class B shares, or $ 135 a share. He paid another $ 201 million for the less powerful Class A shares, or $ 36 a share. The transaction will be completed Wednesday when <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> pays <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> $ 63 million to terminate his management contract with Resorts. `` Sixty-three million for six months' work _ that's not bad,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> on Wednesday also will sell Resorts' unfinished Taj Mahal casino project to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for about $ 273 million. `` That's $ 300 million less than Resorts already has put into it, so as you can see, I'm very happy,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said after Tuesday's closing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that `` it's been a long, exhausting process.'' `` In April, we felt it was a completed deal, but there were so many assets involved,'' he said. `` It's not just buying a hotel, it's buying an island, a surveillance company, real estate, aircraft _ it has so many pieces that it was almost impossible to put it together. `` It all came together today, though, in a stack of paper about 100 feet high.'' Asked what advice he has for <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said, `` He has to work hard. It's going to be a very tough deal. He's got the problem of the Taj's debt and he's taking over a facility that's 60 years old.'' `` He will have to invest millions in it,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said. `` He also is taking over the place in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> that has a brand-new casino opening next to it. More millions will have to be spent to bring it up to date.'' `` It looks like he could lose $ 50 million a year in this transaction,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said. Under terms of the deal, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> will make $ 25 million in improvements to Resorts' <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> casino and another $ 25 million to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> operation. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said he believed both parties `` came out even'' in the deal. He acknowledged that the Resorts' facilities are old, `` but they are also charming.'' `` I purchased the most famous house in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' he said. Having the massive Taj Mahal open next door `` only benefits us _ it will bring a lot of people.'' <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said his first plan of action will be to start capital improvements on the properties `` so that when the Taj opens and people taste this end of the <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> will be content with my spillover.'' <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, a former big band singer and talk show host, has developed a number of television game shows, including `` Wheel of Fortune'' and `` Jeopardy.'' He financed the Resorts deal through a $ 325 million bond offering and will contribute $ 50 million in equity into Resorts. One of the conditions that <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> wanted met before securing the deal _ a $ 200 million tax break _ was granted by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said he raised $ 675 million to complete the 1,250-room Taj Mahal. Construction will begin again immediately, and the doors should open in about 15 months, he said. Also Tuesday, Resorts International released its third-quarter results, showing a $ 339.8 million net loss, the bulk of which comes from the sale of the Taj Mahal and the cost of breaking the management contract. That is compared to a net loss of almost $ 7 million in the same quarter in 1987. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $ 123.9 million, compared to $ 118 million for the same quarter last year. The net loss for the first three quarters of 1988 was $ 357.4 million, compared to net earnings of $ 5.9 million for the first three quarters of 1987. Nine-month revenue rose to $ 353.5 million, up from $ 348 million a year earlier. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> has hired <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>, president of <PERSON> Harrah </PERSON>'s Marina Hotel and Casino, to run Resorts International's <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> gaming hall. The numerous parcels of property that Resorts owns in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> will be sold `` little by little,'' <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said. `` It should n't be coveted _ it should be out there, made available to people. There's a nice 15-acre zoned parcel on the other side of Showboat that would make a very nice spot for someone.''

 Grand Metropolitan PLC on Tuesday extended its hostile $ 5.23 billion tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for the third time, and said <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> shareholders had tendered 79.1 percent of the company's outstanding shares under the offer. The $ 60 a share offer, which was to expire Monday night, was extended to Nov. 18. The offer, launched Oct. 4, is conditioned on the removal of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s `` poison pill'' defense. Judges in two states have left the pill intact despite lawsuits from Grand Met and dissident shareholders. The pill would make a takeover prohibitively expensive. Further court action is pending on the issue. Grand Met said 67,595,940 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> common stock had been tendered and not withdrawn by the Monday night deadline. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, which has rejected the bid as inadequate, had no comment on the extension of the offer. Chairman <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has told <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> shareholders they would be better off keeping their stock in light of the food and restaurant company's proposed spinoff of its Burger King business into a separate public company. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would receive a special dividend and stock Burger King stock under the planned restructuring. The company also is considering other moves to enhance shareholder value, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has said. Separately, Burger King Chairman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> met Tuesday in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> with key franchisees a day after <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, chief of Grand Met's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations, met with the 15-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the official representative of Burger King's 1,200 franchises A number of franchisees are upset over <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to spin off Burger King, on the grounds that corporate support for their businesses would decline from the surviving, debt-burdened company. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> told franchisees that Grand Met would spend a significant amount of money to renovate existing Burger King restaurants, build more, and improve the company's marketing. The strategy could lead to streamlining and management changes at Burger King headquarters in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` We think Burger King is a fantastic brand,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said in an interview after the franchisee meeting at The Bilmore Hotel in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>. `` You ca n't have more than 5,000 outlets with that brand name and not have a tremendously powerful brand names.'' `` I'm impressed. I'm very impressed with him,'' said <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, who owns 38 <ORGANIZATION> Burger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> restaurants in central and northern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` I think they'll do the things necessary to move the system forward.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said his company was `` paying very serious attention'' to rumors that somebody, possilby inspired by <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, might mount a takeover bid for Grand Met. He called the notion that <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> could take over Grand Met, in a so-called Pac Man defense against an unwanted suitor, `` farfetched.'' In such defense, a target attempts to thwart a hostile buyout by taking over its suitor.

<HEAD>ICC Overturns Arbitrator's Ruling In New England Rail Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday overturned a federal arbitrator's ruling that would have reinstated union pay rates and work rules that were slashed by <ORGANIZATION> Guilford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> last year in a sweeping cost-cutting reorganization. The <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION>, on a 3-1 vote, ordered that union and company negotiators return to the arbitrator's mediation table to try to work out new pay rates and work rules for the freight line, the largest privately-owned railroad in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Last year, <PERSON> Guilford </PERSON> reorganized its subsidaries, <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION>, putting them under <ORGANIZATION> Springfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terminal </ORGANIZATION>, a tiny rail line with much lower wage scales. <LOCATION> Guilford </LOCATION> officials argued that the move was necessary to cut costs and keep the company competitive. In June, arbitrator <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasher </PERSON> ruled that workers transferred to <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Terminal </LOCATION> must be the wages they received under their <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Central contracts and be subject to the work rules under those pacts. But <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gradison </PERSON>, ruling Tuesday on an appeal from the company, said the arbitrator's decision on pay rates and work rules failed to give <LOCATION> Guilford </LOCATION> officials `` management flexibility.'' She voted with the majority to send the issue back to the arbitrator and negotiators for mediation, although she noted that `` we have never seen anything to lead us to believe that -LRB- the two sides -RRB- can or will come up with an agreement.'' `` Our objective is we want to see this railroad operate. We want to see management be fair to labor. We want to see labor be fair to management,'' she said. `` It's tempting to impose a solution here today, but we believe you understand your business better than anybody else.'' Commissioner <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, voting with <PERSON> Gradison </PERSON> and Commissioner <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andre </PERSON>, said she feared that forcing <PERSON> Guilford </PERSON> to comply with the old union wage scales and work rules would cripple the company and its ability to compete. <ORGANIZATION> Guilford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Billerica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. company owned by <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON>, a reclusive heir to the <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON> banking family of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, reorganized last year, saying it could not compete under the union wage and rule restrictions. In a statement released following the commission meeting, the company said it would `` wok within the process prescribed by the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> in the hope that it will pave the way for the railroad to meet the competitive challenges of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> marketplace while at the same time meeting the requirements of the railroad's employees.'' Commissioner <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamboley </PERSON>, the lone dissenter, said it was inappropriate to `` dissect'' portions of the arbitrator's decision. `` You ca n't break out bits and pieces of it,'' he said, adding that the commission was venturing into an area beyond its expertise. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyden </PERSON>, international vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said he was disappointed with the commission's ruling on pay rates and work rules, but applauded the panel's votes upholding other sections of the arbitrator's decision The commission ruled 4-0 to affirm <PERSON> Kasher </PERSON>'s decision to provide <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Central workers not rehired by <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Terminal </LOCATION> with severance pay and benefits in accordance with the old contracts. And the commission agreed that workers hired by <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Terminal </LOCATION> must receive the difference between their new salaries and their old, higher wages for up to six years. But the workers would be subject to the new work rules that <LOCATION> Guilford </LOCATION> officials say would make the company more efficient. The commission also voted unanimously to require <PERSON> Guilford </PERSON> to honor the seniority employees built up at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION>.

 Just days after initiating an industry move to drop discounts aimed at business travelers, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> announced a restructured `` MaxSaver'' program Tuesday that is expected to boost most remaining cut-rate fares. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> said MaxSaver fares _ which are used by most vacation travelers _ would be based on the length of a flight under the new formula. Competition on individual routes, not mileage, had determined the fares in the past. It was not immediately clear whether other big carriers would follow <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s move, but the airline has been the pacesetter on fares in recent years. The airline planned to notify travel agents about the new fares Tuesday night and Wednesday, spokesman <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. He said the new MaxSaver fares would take effect next Wednesday. `` You will see some MaxSavers going up and some MaxSavers going down,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` We are returning air fares to a more rational level.'' He said fares for longer flights generally would be raised while those for shorter hauls would mostly be reduced. Some travel agents told about the changes said they appeared to have the effect of raising roughly two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s MaxSaver fares and cutting the remaining third or so `` They're going to raise it to the level that it should have been in the first place,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, the owner of JB's <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. MaxSaver tickets must be purchased seven to 14 days in advance and require an overnight stay. Air fare structures have become geographically `` out of whack'' as a result of airlines frequently matching each other's fare increases in recent months, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, an airline analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The changes come amid plans by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and other big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to eliminate another category of discount air fares _ the `` junk fares'' available four to seven days before a flight and used mainly by business travelers. In a move initiated by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and followed by several major carriers, the junk fares were slated to be eliminated on Tuesday. But the airlines decided to extend the deadline by a week because of confusion over the change. Only about 10 percent to 20 percent of all airline passengers use the last-minute junk fares, according to some analysts' estimates. The popular MaxSaver fares, by contrast, are used by most vacation travelers. More than 90 percent of air travelers use some form of discount fare, be it last-minute or advance purchase, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an industry trade group based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The discounts generally are n't available for flights during holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. Some examples of changes in <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s one-way MaxSaver fares are: _ Between <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>: current off-peak fare, $ 129; current peak fare, $ 159; new off-peak, $ 139; new peak, unchanged _ Between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>: current off-peak, $ 149; current peak, $ 169; new off-peak and peak, both unchanged _ Between <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>: current off-peak, $ 174, current peak, $ 204; new off-peak, $ 159; new peak, $ 179 _ Between <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>: current off-peak, $ 159; current peak, $ 184; new off-peak, $ 179; new peak, $ 199 _ Between <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>: current off-peak, $ 114; current peak, $ 144; new off-peak, $ 129; new peak, $ 149

<HEAD>Union Members Vote To Accept New Contract; Mickey Mouse Won't
Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of a union coalition representing 9,200 workers at <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to accept a new three-year contract, ending a strike threat against the giant tourist attraction. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Totzke </PERSON>, president of the six-union <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, reported union members voted 1,059-677 to approve the agreement, which provided for immediate pay raises of 35 cents to 50 cents. Asked about two previous rejections of similar offers and repeated calls by some union members for a strike, <PERSON> Totzke </PERSON> said: `` I think they finally took a realistic look at the offer. I can say it now it was a fair offer. We got all we could get.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> vice president for labor relations, said, `` I'm obviously very happy about it We felt that we had a good contract.'' Rejection by two-thirds of the voters would have authorized labor leaders to call a strike. Among the workers represented by the <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> are ride operators, sandwich makers, bus drivers, stockroom workers, hotel housekeepers and clerks, animal handlers, monorail pilots and the people who portray <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Duck </PERSON>, Goofy and other characters. The company has said it was prepared for normal operations in the event of a strike. Disney officials planned to fill park operating jobs from among the 13,000-plus non-union employees, and from among management, workers who chose not to observe a strike call and any people hired after a strike call. The balloting was the second within four days. An election last Friday was nullified by union bosses who discovered some workers voted more than once. Angry employees rejected two earlier contract proposals, contending they did not offer enough money for pay raises. The new contract provides pay raises of 50 cents an hour to workers now at top scale, who earn from $ 6.80 to $ 9.70 an hour, and raises of 35 cents an hour for workers below top scale, who now make $ 4.85 to $ 9.20 an hour. In April 1990, workers at top scale would get pay hikes of 45 cents an hour, while those below top scale would receive 30 cents an hour. Workers rejected an earlier package offering wage increases of 5 percent in the first year and 4 percent in each of the contract's final two years, plus other benefits Dissatisfaction by many union members dates back to 1985, when the unions agreed to a two-year wage freeze and took one-time bonuses instead. Two weeks later, the company announced record revenue and profit for its 1985 fiscal year, union members said. The Service Trades Council is composed of the <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Restaurant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Judge Strikes One Contract Provision Pilots Said Hindered Buyout</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has struck down a provision of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' contract with union machinists, ruling the language was intended to hinder the pilots union's attempt to buy the carrier, union and company officials said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> sued in April to block two provisions in <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s contract with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> on the grounds. The pilots union claimed the provisions were restrictive covenants aimed at blocking its more than $ 4 billion proposal to buy the airline, said <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON> on Saturday rejected one provision, which would have prohibited the pilots' union from participating in an employee ownership plan unless the machinists and other unions agreed to the terms, <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for corporate communications, said late Tuesday the airline would have no comment on the ruling. United spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> confirmed <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON>'s rejection of the provision, but said Tuesday he did not know the details of the lawsuit or of the judge's decision. <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON> said that under the stricken provision, any stock ownership option tendered to the pilots would have to be offered to the other unions and subjected to possible arbitration. `` We'd be in the position of trying to buy a company and not knowing what the price was going to be until after arbitration,'' <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON> said. Local 1487 of the Machinists, which negotiated the contract with <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement confirming <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON>'s rejection of the provision, but made no further comment. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON>, president of the local, was in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on Tuesday and would not be available for comment until next week, said a union officer who declined to be identified. <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON> let stand the second provision challenged in the <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit. That provision would give the Machinists a choice of reneging on their existing contract or extending it for three years in the event of any takeover. In April 1987, the machinists refused to join <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> in its buyout attempt, citing what union officials called philosophical and technical problems with the pilots' proposal. Despite that refusal, <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said last December they considered the possibility of a sympathy strike against <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> if the machinists and the airline failed to agree on a contract. The machinists' pact, containing the two provisions challenged by <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>, was reached Nov. 15, 1987, hours before expiration of a 30-day `` cooling-off'' period. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>, which has made three offers to acquire the airline, has enlisted the aid of a syndicate of banks and the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The pilots' first proposal for a $ 4.5 billion employee takeover of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> was made in April 1987 and rejected by its parent <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that same month as inadequate. Two months later, in June 1987, <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> came back with a recapitalization plan, under which ownership of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> would have been transferred to employees and stockholders. The company also rejected that proposal.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar moved higher against the Japanese yen in Wednesday morning trading, while share prices rose to another record high on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar opened at 123.58 yen, up from Tuesday's close of 123.25 yen, and by late morning was changing hands at 123.50 yen.

The dealer said it was a good sign that different types of issues were variously leading the market. `` As long as this sort of cycle continues, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> will continue to grow for some time,'' he said.

<HEAD>Rate Intitative Reaction Hit Business Harder than Consumers, Study
Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most of the insurance companies that quit selling and renewing policies after last week's voter approval of a rate-cutting initiative have returned to the market, according to an industry survey released Tuesday. But far fewer companies are offering homeowners' and business liability policies, according to the survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION> and Brokers of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The survey, which gauged the market as of Monday, suggested that fears of mass insurer defections from the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> market after last week's passage of Proposition 103 _ a ballot initiative that would deeply cut insurance rates _ were exaggerated. Numerous companies suspended policy sales and renewals after the initiative passed last Tuesday. But many have returned to the market since the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, acting on an industry lawsuit, put the measure on hold pending a trial. As of Monday, the brokers' group found, companies making up 81 percent of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> market were selling new auto insurance policies. Renewals were being offered by companies representing 94 percent of the market. For reasons the group has yet to determine, the figures were far lower for homeowners and business policies. Insurers accounting for 75 percent of the market for homeowners' policies were selling new policies, while renewals were available from companies making up 83 percent of the market New commercial insurance policies were available from companies holding just 54 percent of that market, and renewals were available in 66 percent of the market. The figures are based on direct communication with 75 insurance carriers that hold more than 90 percent of the market, and were valid as of Monday, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Annotti </PERSON>, spokesman for the agents' group While the high court's stay has returned stability to the market, the long-term health of the industry _ and the availability of insurance to consumers _ depends on the outcome of the lawsuit, <PERSON> Annotti </PERSON> said. He repeated frequent industry warnings that most insurers would incur unacceptable losses if Proposition 103 were upheld. The measure, backed by consumer crusader <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, was approved by voters who rejected four other competing initiatives proposed by industry or trial lawyers' groups. Proposition 103's principal effect would be to roll rates for nearly all types of insurance back to November 1987 levels, and then impose an additional 20 percent cut.
