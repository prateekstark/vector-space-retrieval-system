<HEAD>Mississippi River Found To Be Polluted And Deadly</HEAD>

 Tons of pollution poured into the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> each year threaten to push up already-high death rates all along the river, said the authors of a report released Wednesday by the environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're seeing an obvious pattern,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, who wrote the report with <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Costner </PERSON>. `` The overall conclusion is that mortality rates in counties along the river are higher than in the rest of the nation and tend also to be higher than the rest of counties in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> states,'' <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said. The conclusions were drawn from a two-year review of data from state and federal environmental agencies, as well as from laboratory analyses conducted during a voyage down the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> ship Beluga in 1988. Pollution was found from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, to the mouth of the river. It was found in increasing amounts as the expedition continued downstream, the report said. The most severely elevated death rates occur downstream from areas of the greatest toxic discharges, including <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> and all riverside parishes in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, the report said. The report noted that some downstream communities, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, draw drinking water from the river. Average mortality rates in lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> counties and parishes, from <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, are 14 percent higher than the rest of the nation, researchers said. The river carries 213 million pounds of toxic chemicals per year as it passes <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, the report said. Beginning at the river's mouth, the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> contains a 2.4 million acre dead zone which can not support aquatic life The report blamed pollution for decreasing fish and wildlife populations all along the river. River pollution comes from chemical manufacture, the use and manufacture of pesticides, pulp and paper mills, sewage treatment plants and hazardous waste disposal facilities, <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said. `` It's not a pretty report and the picture that it paints is not a pretty picture,'' said <PERSON> Costner </PERSON>. `` What we're seeing is evidence that it's time to change.'' <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> warned that without immediate action to reduce pollution in the river, as well as along its banks and in the air, the entire river region can expect more cancer and other problems. The <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> also released a report Tuesday showing that between 1987 and 1988, its member industries had reduced by 9.1 percent, or 89 million pounds, the chemical wastes they are required to report to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Its members disposed of 924 million pounds of chemical wastes in 1988, the report said. <ORGANIZATION> LCA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleiner </PERSON> said the report does not include all wastes, only those required to be reported under federal Superfund regulations. He said the amount of wastes not reported under those regulations could not be determined. Chemical industry officials dispute the correlation between cancer rates and chemical releases, saying the statistics used by <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> have not been adjusted for other factors, such as poverty, race, urban locations and smoking and drinking.

 <LOCATION> MORGANTOWN </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> _ A magistrate on Wednesday dropped a weapons charge against <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON>, citing a lack of evidence <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> County </PERSON> <PERSON> Magistrate </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the 21-year-old beauty queen had a right to defend herself with a small-caliber handgun during her late night tussle with <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON>, 23. `` Now had she taken the gun out and held it on this woman or initiated the problem, that's different,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` But if someone has you by the hair, and you just momentarily bring it into view to scare them off, that's not brandishing.'' <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> had alleged that <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> pulled a gun on her during a Nov. 7 scuffle on a city street after a traffic accident. <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON>, in turn, filed a complaint accusing <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> of reckless driving, battery and destruction of property. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> found <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> guilty of all three counts and sentenced her to two terms of 120 days in the <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, respectively, on the battery and property charges and 90 days on the driving offense. The sentences are to run concurrently. <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> was freed on a $ 2,000 property bond that will allow her to remain free until Dec. 27. `` I wanted togive her time to enjoy her holiday,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` This whole thing was really just a cat fight.'' <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> said she wants to put the incident behind her. `` This was n't the first threat I've had from her and it's not the first threat I've had from other people,'' she said. `` I am afraid, but life happens you just have to deal with it.'' <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON>, whose reign ends in June, said she plans to continue carrying a handgun for protection.

<HEAD>U.S. Justice Department Approves Revised Charter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says it has no objection to the changes to the City Charter that were approved by voters last month. News of the approval came in a letter to <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> A.O </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, from Acting Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> of the department's civil rights division `` Our work is now done,'' <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> said. `` The foundation has been laid for a more representative, fairer and efficient city government.'' <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON>, a former city corporation counsel, noted that <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s letter `` calls particular attention to the fact that ` minority voters will likely have an increased opportunity to elect members of the enlarged and more powerful City Council.' `` Increasing minority representation in the city government was one of the <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s major goals,'' he said. Although <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> wrote that the department `` interposes no objection'' to the revised charter, he added that federal law allows the option of going to court in the future `` to enjoin the enforcement of these changes.'' The revised charter abolishes the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION> and transfers its fiscal and planning powers to the mayor, the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and other city officials. It also increases the size of the council from 35 to 51 members. The <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION> had been declared unconstitutional because it gave equal representation to each borough despite wide disparities in population. <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallone </PERSON>, who has long pushed for abolition of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION> and a more equitable balance of power between the city's executive and legislative branches, also praised the department's decision.

 The drought of 1988 hit hardest in the upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> _ perhaps nowhere harder than in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. More disaster relief aid went there than to any other state. The third story in a four-part series, `` Cashing In on the Drought,'' examines how the $ 3.9 billion disaster aid program helped farmers most in need.

 <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Grindberg </PERSON> survived the drought with a $ 45,000 dose of federal aid. But for this farmer and others, it was a give-and-take bailout: Take the money with one hand, give it away with the other. `` The guy who sold me $ 5,000 of fuel, he got paid,'' <PERSON> Grindberg </PERSON> said. `` The business that sold me fertilizer and spray and chemicals and tires, they got paid. What I'm saying is, the farmer got the money directly, but indirectly a lot of others benefited.'' The 1988 drought relief program poured more than $ 400 million into <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, the nation's most agriculturally dependent state. The money not only helped rescue thousands of farmers; many say it also kept the state afloat. `` It's what carried us through in 1988,'' said <LOCATION> Cass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> extension agent <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>. `` If it had n't been for drought aid, the economic situation all through <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> would have been disastrous. It was the major source of income for most farmers.'' `` I do n't think too many farmers took disaster aid and bought Cadillacs and went on vacation in my area,'' <PERSON> Grindberg </PERSON> added. A study of the $ 3.9 billion disaster relief program, conducted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> over seven months, found that outside the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> drought area, lax rules and requirements led to thousands of farmers collecting millions of dollars for nothing more serious than the normal trials of nature. But money did reach areas <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> most intended to aid, including <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, where it kept some farmers on their land and may have prevented some business closures. `` You might say it kept the state alive,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Selberg </PERSON>, another farmer in this <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION>. `` Everyone in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> in some way or another was helped.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, where the drought evoked memories of Dust Bowl days with tumbleweed dancing along the barren horizon, received the most disaster dollars. More than 49,000 producers shared $ 410.2 million _ about 10.5 percent of the total package. Almost all was for crop loss. The state, the No. 1 producer of hard-red spring wheat, lost two-thirds of its 1988 crop; millions of normally golden acres withered to pathetic rows of shriveled brown stumps. But drought aid cut farmers' losses from $ 1.1 billion to $ 706 million, a <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study found. Disaster payments reduced statewide losses to businesses, banks and households from $ 3.4 billion to $ 2.1 billion, the study said. Each farm dollar triples as it travels down Main Street into the economy. Another university survey of 466 farmers said that without drought aid, the average farmer's net cash income would have been just $ 6,300. Drought payments added $ 15,000. Disaster aid and crop insurance also were critical to other drought-ravaged states, including <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The five states together received nearly half the assistance allocated nationwide. Disaster aid and crop insurance pumped about $ 500 million into <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s economy, an <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study said. `` There was no question it was needed to stave off a major new wave of bankruptcies and financial problems among Corn Belt producers,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, a university economist. `` Even the drought assistance for most farmers fell well short of bringing what their income would be with normal yields, but it provided a safety net,'' he said. It was the same in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, which has struggled with an exodus of young, educated people, declining revenues, fading small towns and the loss of nearly a fifth of its farms this decade. `` From'81 through'86, the bottom pretty much fell out of everything,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>, who farms about five miles from <LOCATION> Grindberg </LOCATION>. Good crops the next two years started to reverse the trend, but drought stalled the recovery. `` It has a demoralizing effect when you have a disaster,'' said <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Aakre </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> State economist. `` Financial aid helps to alleviate that. The last thing <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> needed is more negatives to push us down.'' Despite relief and nearly $ 200 million in crop insurance, the state still needs `` a good year to get back on our feet,'' <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> said. `` We did n't get that in'89,'' he added, referring to continuing drought in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s west and south-central sections. In fact, while crops statewide are in better shape than 12 months ago, dollar losses will exceed 1988's estimated $ 530 million, <PERSON> Aakre </PERSON> said. Two reasons why: more acres of wheat were planted this year, and farmers do n't have grain reserves to sell at high prices as they did in 1988 to ease their burden. <PERSON> Cass </PERSON> <PERSON> County </PERSON> also had a better 1989 crop but expects higher losses in crop dollars. And while virtually all farmers here received government aid in 1988, far fewer will be eligible a second time. About $ 19.8 million in 1988 aid was divvied up among 1,847 farms in <LOCATION> Cass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the state's leader in crop acres. Wheat, corn, barley, soybeans, sugar beets and navy and pinto beans are grown here. Last year, production was 60 percent to 70 percent below normal. For <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, a 36-year-old father of three who farms 1,000 acres near the town of <LOCATION> Horace </LOCATION>, $ 39,000 in aid, even coupled with $ 55,000 in crop insurance, amounted to `` just enough to break even. We were able to cover all our bills. That's all I had really hoped for.'' If that seems like a lot, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, who grows wheat, soybeans and barley, notes it costs him $ 150,000 for rent, interest, seed, fertilizer, equipment and other necessities. `` You throw a lot of expenses way ahead of what your crop is going to be,'' he said. `` Our investment in farming is tremendous compared to the average businessman. At least they have a commodity to sell. We might not.'' <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>, who farms 6,000 acres, said that without his $ 100,000 maximum payment he might have been forced to sell equipment or lay off help. Along with crop insurance and the sale of grain reserves, he said, `` I was able to mark time in'88. ... Last year we had a break-even type of year. This year it was break-even. Next year, we're going to have to start coming around to a profit.'' <PERSON> Grindberg </PERSON>, who farms 900 acres of wheat, soybeans and barley, was in the red last year despite $ 70,000 in aid and insurance. His 1989 crop was better but still below normal; he expects to get only $ 3,000 in relief payments. <PERSON> Grindberg </PERSON>, a 40-year farming veteran who also delivers mail part-time, thinks the government last year `` pushed he panic button on this disaster thing and went too far. In'89, they went too far the other way I think.'' `` Disaster aid is political,'' he said. `` Depending on when you have the disaster depends on whether they sweeten the pot or not. If it's an election year ... they all get on the bandwagon.'' But <PERSON> Grindberg </PERSON> will persist. `` As long as the banker says go on,'' he said, `` next year's always the best year.

 Not all who collected aid from the 1988 drought program were Midwestern farmers faced with ruin. Cotton farmers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, lettuce growers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> company that raised potatoes, all collected federal dollars _ completely legally _ even though, by their own admission, they could have weathered last year's drought. Here are some stories of aid that spilled beyond the boundaries of the 1988 drought:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Last year was n't so bad for Conowingo, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, dairyman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>. Good rains in July rescued his feed corn from six weeks of no rain, and milk prices were up. But when he heard about the disaster program, he went over his records with county officials. Two hours of paperwork and he was told he qualified for $ 1,200. `` Six hundred dollars an hour,'' <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> said with a grin as he milked his 140 Guernseys in his long, open barn. `` That's not bad pay. About the same as a lawyer.'' <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> makes no apologies about taking the money. `` It was there and I took advantage of it,'' he said. But he does n't favor a repeat of the program. `` It would make people say, I can put crops in the ground and if it does n't grow, I'll collect,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Lathem </PERSON> and his family are what you might call diversified farmers. They run a real estate company; grow wheat, corn and milo; raise cattle; and own three oil wells that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> operates on their <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Panhandle land. To participate in federal price support programs for their main crops of wheat, corn and milo, they have to set aside some acres. In 1988, they planted potatoes on 125 of those acres _ and saw hail wipe out the crop. Other crops did well. But the <PERSON> Lathem </PERSON> family was far from being knocked out of farming by hail on potatoes planted on excess acres. Their farm, formally named the <ORGANIZATION> Lico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION>, received $ 134,087 under the drought program, legally exceeding the $ 100,000 single-farmer aid limit because the partnership is owned by four family members. The potatoes were insured and were expected to gross $ 223,600 for <PERSON> Lico </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Lico </PERSON>'s file at the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Insurance plus the disaster aid brought $ 214,153 _ without the expense of harvest, which <PERSON> Lathem </PERSON> said would have been two-thirds the cost of raising the potatoes. Still, he said he only broke even on the potato acreage. `` You bet it was necessary,'' <PERSON> Lathem </PERSON> said. `` We would n't have lost the farm over it, but we probably would have had to do some things differently. It would have been much tougher to go back and plant crops for the new year. I think it was a good program.''

 The 1987 growing year, plagued by heavy rain and high winds, was horrible for <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chaves </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, cotton grower, but no disaster payment program existed to help him then. White got luckier in 1988, because of the record-setting drought in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Although he had a better crop in 1988, he was able to collect disaster aid. `` I had a cold, cold, cold rain and then that wind that comes down like on a runway and just cuts the cotton,'' said White. About half his cotton was wiped out last year, although his irrigated fields still yielded a healthy 355 pounds per acre and he made about two-thirds of his normal gross, based on government payment rates. Insurance paid $ 8,959, and drought aid approved by the local <ORGANIZATION> ASCS </ORGANIZATION> office paid $ 18,285 _ even though the disaster law included neither cold weather nor high winds.

 Last year was not the luckiest for <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Race </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who grows apples and corn in <LOCATION> Blairstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>. A well that fed a special trickle irrigation system for some of his orchards dried up A pump that watered his corn failed at the height of the dry weather. Yet Race weathered the drought well; good production on other acres eased his losses. So he went to the county office with some trepidation to inquire about the 1988 drought relief program. He learned he was entitled to a payment, but he felt uncomfortable with government programs. `` It's kind of a personal pride thing. You think you're asking for welfare,'' he said. `` I was thinking some low interest loans of 4.5 percent, that would be great.'' Instead, he got cash, nearly $ 12,000. `` I sat and wondered, ` What am I going to do with $ 12,000?''' he said. `` I decided the best way to spend the money was to buy an irrigation pump.'' He spent $ 13,000 for a pump. Then came 1989 and its endless rains. `` It's been sitting out there, rusting ever since,'' Race, laughing, said of his new pump.

Winds he estimated at 80-90 mph damaged 147.5 acres of irrigated wheat in February 1988. By harvest time, nothing was worth cutting, so he just plowed it up, he said. He did n't have insurance. Months later, unexpected help arrived in the form of the drought relief bill _ a program that had n't even been considered when the winds took his wheat. He collected $ 11,499. `` If the wheat had been good, we would have made twice that much,'' <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said. `` I'd rather have a big wheat crop than take a check from the government anytime.''

<HEAD>Maryland County Sells Own Brand of Discount Liquor</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 When high school senior <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergeron </PERSON> learned that <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was selling its own brand of liquor, the local official of Students Against Drunk Driving was furious. `` How can a county, with its innumerable drug task forces and anti-drug campaigns, run liquor stores and, even worse, bottle its own brand of liquor?'' the 17-year-old wrote recently in a letter to the editor of a local newspaper. The question has grown old for county officials, who had hoped the furor over its <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION> brand would have died away by now, nearly two months after the discount brand of gin, vodka, rum, bourbon and Scotch went on sale in county-run liquor stores. Introduction of the house brand liquor brought out a flurry of news coverage and critical letters to the editors of newspapers. But county officials say they only received three critical letters and the issue has quieted. `` Let's put this in perspective, for God's sake. A private label does n't make anyone drink,'' said county liquor control director <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Baylin </PERSON>. `` All we're saying is if you choose to drink in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, please shop here.'' <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> buys directly from producers, wholesaling beer and wine to retailers but handling sales of liquor through its own stores. County officials maintain <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION> is no different from house labels of other large liquor retailers. The house liquor is made by a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> distillery, which bottles it in two sizes under the County Crest label. A 1.75-liter jug of <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION> ranges in price from $ 10.95 for vodka to $ 15.99 for Scotch _ $ 2 or $ 3 less than comparable brands, but more than the cheapest products. The affluent county outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, whose voters opted to control alcohol sales at the end of Prohibition, is the first local government in the nation to retail its own liquor, said <PERSON> Baylin </PERSON>, who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcoholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverages </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. According to the association, which represents governments that directly control the sale and distribution of liquor, 19 states purchase liquor and either sell to retailers or directly to the public, in addition to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, where only <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> does so. County Executive <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said the sale of <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION> was in keeping with the county's goal of controlling liquor sales, as well as a source of extra revenue. Some of the revenue raised by the liquor control office pays for substance abuse programs, he added. According to <PERSON> Baylin </PERSON>, the liquor control office has netted $ 62 million above expenses in the past five years. He said it is too soon to know how much money the sale of house brand liquor will raise, but the products appear to be `` doing exceptionally well, thanks to the press.'' <PERSON> Bergeron </PERSON> said she was angered by the introduction of <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION> at a time when <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials have been pressing SADD to abandon its policy of neither condoning nor condemning teen-age drinking in favor of a `` zero tolerance'' stance. `` Basically, they are saying SADD is sending mixed messages when they themselves are doing that,'' said <PERSON> Bergeron </PERSON>, who is treasurer of the county's SADD chapter. `` I'm not going to listen to someone who's a hypocrite.'' The county government says controlling alcohol sales is better than permitting liquor stores on every corner. Neighboring Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which does not have liquor control, has more than 140 liquor stores, compared with the 23 government outlets in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baylin </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Bright, head of the Montgomery chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, said there is nothing wrong with liquor control but thinks the county should not both regulate and participate in the liquor industry. `` We have enough brands to choose from without the county making its own,'' she said.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>: `` I am more humiliated and ashamed than anybody can ever imagine that I've been found guilty of a serious crime. ... I feel like I'm in the middle of a nightmare. `` A few years ago, I lost my only son. They dug up his grave and ripped me apart in the newspapers. I beg you, do n't let me lose <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, too.'' `` Our whole life has been work and each other. Please do n't. We have nothing else. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.''

<TEXT>
 Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>: `` The scheme was for your direct benefit. You bear the full responsibility for this scheme with all of its fraudulent permutations.'' `` Unlike many defendants who come before the court, you were not driven to this crime by financial greed, rather your conduct was the product of naked greed. Throughout its course, you persisted in the arrogant belief that you were above the law. Moreover, since the indictment and the trial, you have displayed no remorse or contrition at having committed the offenses in this case.''

<TEXT>
 The leftist guerrilla movement's decision to launch escalated attacks in the cities has brought relative calm to the countryside, for 10 years the civil war's principal theater. Both the guerrillas and the army have concentrated most of their fighters in or around <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and several provincial capitals since the rebels began their urban offensive Nov. 11. Areas controlled by the insurgents and government forces have not changed significantly, but the urban concentration appears to favor the rebels, whose organizational base always has been the forsaken hamlets and byways of this small Central American nation. Although fewer guerrillas are operating in the countryside, they appear to be able to move more openly and with less pressure from government forces. In <LOCATION> Usulutan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, in the heavily fought-over eastern third of the country, the government forces that were observed generally were restricted to two paved highways and strategic population centers. During one day's travel in one region alone, no government troops were seen at all. Guerrillas, however, walked openly along trails and oxcart-rutted tracks through fields of corn, sorghum, soybeans and sesame. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON>, a town of about 5,000 people, residents said rebels were coming and going almost daily, buying supplies, talking with townspeople and trying to recruit new fighters. `` They gather the young guys and ask them to accompany them to a meeting outside town,'' said the owner of a small business. `` After a couple hours they come back, except maybe one or two who decide to join.'' He, like others, said the rebels did not point their guns at the prospective recruits or otherwise coerce them. Even so, one of the few young men around said he hid every time the guerrillas came to town and almost no civilian males between 14 and 25 years old walked the streets. The rightist government of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> has accused the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of `` kidnapping'' hundreds of young men in recent weeks, allegedly to replace losses suffered in the offensive. A five-man rebel squad encountered just south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> included two boys barely taller than their M-16 assault rifles. One, who appeared to be about 13, flashed a smile and V-for-victory sign. He said he had been a guerrilla for three months. The army has not completely abandoned the countryside. At the isolated hamlet of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palmo </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> in the west-central part of the province, a 30-man search-and-destroy unit of an elite infantry battalion engaged and routed a guerrilla contingent. The soldiers of the Atonal battalion proceeded to burn or throw down a ravine large quantities of beans, salt, tortillas, fresh meat and clothing left behind by rebels. The guerrilla camp had also served as a factory for homemade catapults used as artillery, about a dozen of which were found and destroyed. In the southeastern part of the province near the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast, government forces were limited to a contingent of 6th army brigade troops in <LOCATION> Jucuaran </LOCATION> and a detachment of Marines on <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espino </LOCATION> beach. Peasant farmers of the region know where the rebels are camped. After an hour of coffee sipping and conversation, a young woman excused herself and left a tile-roofed adobe house near <LOCATION> Jucuaran </LOCATION>. She returned a few minutes later to say she would take reporters to the rebel base several miles away. `` The offensive is irreversible,'' said `` <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON>,'' the khaki-clad, AK-47-toting regional commander in an interview beneath a tree beside a cow pasture. `` The war has entered a definitive phase, and nothing except deeper crisis and more instability can be expected.'' Some of the most destructive fighting of the urban offensive has been in working-class neighborhoods. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> acknowledged that taking the war to the cities may have alienated many of the same poor people the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> claims to champion. `` People in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> never really felt the war like people in the countryside. Their routine of home-to-work-to-home, the desire for stability came to cloud their vision and limit their ambition to being able to put up a new curtain in the kitchen,'' he said. `` We know war does not bring well-being. It's not that we see war as the solution in itself. It is a means, and it is the only option they have left us,'' he said.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Huge crowds opposing a Communist government chanted, `` Demisi,'' meaning, resign. But some shifted the chant slightly to `` Devizy.'' That means foreign exchange. To Czechoslovaks, freedom to travel is an empty privilege without currency to spend abroad. Beyond their borders their banknotes in crowns are hardly worth anything. Once a year, Czechoslovaks are allowed to line up for days to buy a maximum of $ 23 at twice the official rate. Or they can buy any amount on the black market at nearly five times the rate. That is one crushing problem <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> faces in trying to retool a centrally planned socialist bloc economy into a prosperous system open to the world. There are a lot more. `` Basically, everything that was wrong before is still wrong,'' observed a Western economic analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity. `` And things are getting worse.'' <PERSON> Dusan </PERSON> <PERSON> Triska </PERSON>, a senior economist in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, agreed, adding a litany of crises that reformers will have to address. Western banks are lined up to lend money, and investors are milling in the wings. In <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, however, any economic solution hinges on social and political priorities. `` Above all,'' <PERSON> Triska </PERSON> said, `` we have to avoid mistakes made by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Before we open to the exterior, we have to open up inside. We ca n't use foreign resources until we can use our own.'' Until the war, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> had <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s sixth strongest economy, with heavy industry and some of the world's most advanced technology. During 40 years of Communism, plants were operated with little investment and shoddy maintenance. The once-strong infrastructure now needs billions of dollars worth of capital. The system operates at a loss, with no relation between costs and prices. Milk sells for half what it costs to produce. Bread is so cheap farmers use it for fodder. Since the 1968 Soviet-led invasion, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders have tried to offer 15 million Czechoslovaks the softest life in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in exchange for political submissiveness. There is a car for every 4.9 people. An average worker can buy one with 15 months' pay. Most Eastern Europeans wait years for delivery. Everyone has a job, and goldbricking is seldom grounds for dismissal. Workers are encouraged to spend weekends at vacation homes. Shops offer Italian kiwis and French cheeses. If veal is scarce, the lamb is excellent. Vacations are cheap for travelers who like <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. The system is rich ground for larceny, from petty to grand. Waiters sell caviar from the refrigerator. Doctors take tips for preferred service. Factory managers wheel and deal. Pressure was contained when lives were lived behind an Iron Curtain. Now that people want to travel and buy Western goods, the closed economy generates growing frustration. The hard part is that it must get worse before it gets better. Any new government will need a firm mandate. `` Someone will have to tell Czechoslovaks they have to work harder and earn less,'' <PERSON> Triska </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ca n't do that.'' Most likely, a Western diplomat noted, a coalition government will emerge. `` Coalitions are not famous for taking tough measures,'' he said. Economists agree that reform means massive layoffs and reduced control will send prices soaring. Subsidies have to be eliminated. And incompetent managers must be replaced. `` We will have to abolish many inefficient factories and gradually open to the international market,'' said economist <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Slouf </PERSON>, a deputy mayor of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. `` Any new elected government will be unpopular within months.'' Speaking privately, Czechoslovak specialists wonder if any political leaders will be able to break up the forbidding mass of state monopolies for industries and services. One reformer, who asked not to be named, put it: `` These mafias of managers are too organized, too well protected. They do n't want change. There are so many ways to resist.'' The economy was shaped within the Soviet bloc when central planners prepared to parallel _ and outdo _ the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. The systems, though outmoded and largely discredited, remain intact. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s largest employer is an uncompetitive steel industry. It makes its own version of three-quarters of the world's range of engineering items Unlike <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> borrowed little and kept up reserves. As other economies failed, it supplied their staples. With a touch of national pride, leaders subjected Socialist brothers to customs barriers. Czechoslovak economists agree they must avoid borrowing until loans can be put to use expanding earnings. Meantime, the economy needs `` devizy,'' hard currency. Tourism is a potential source. <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> is among <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most beautiful cities. The countryside, in forests and mountains, is often dramatic. Other service industries are virgin ground for joint ventures. `` A lot is possible,'' <PERSON> Slouf </PERSON> said. `` But you only have to look at the experience of our neighbors. It will not be simple.''

 Right-wing extremist <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> could face criminal prosecution for remarks linking a <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister's name to <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camps.

<TEXT>
 Less than a month after marching on Wenceslas Square demanding free elections, <PERSON> Lubor </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilchal </PERSON> is overseeing contributions and poster campaigns for the opposition. The pro-democracy movement, which swiftly overturned 41 years of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> domination, now is frantically organizing for the elections it had long demanded. Spilchal is an activist with Civic Forum, the main opposition coalition, which is trying to gear up for elections without knowing exactly how they will take shape or when they will occur. On Tuesday, it was unclear how a new president would be selected. Under the constitution <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> has until Dec. 23 to elect a president to succeed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> hard-liner <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, who resigned Sunday. But some legislators want a referendum, with the people making the choice. There is also the question of when free parliamentary elections will be held. They are expected some time next year. The uncertainty, as political developments roar like a tidal wave across <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, has left everybody scrambling. Anything seemed possible. Civic Forum has opened an office at an art gallery near <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s old quarter and young volunteers are having trouble coping with the demand for information and requests to join `` We do n't have any idea how many people have signed up, it's something like 20,000 a day,'' said <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Blazkova </PERSON>, handing a registration form to a suburban housewife `` We're so busy we have n't had time to count.'' The office is open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., `` but people are still coming long after we are closed,'' said <PERSON> Spilchal </PERSON>. `` We're having an invasion from the country, people coming from far away Nearly everyone makes a contribution.'' By midday Tuesday, <PERSON> Spilchal </PERSON> had received more than 10,000 crowns -LRB- $ 1,000 -RRB-, which was to be divided between a student strike fund, the Civic Forum and <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s campaign for president. Civic Forum spokesman <PERSON> Lubos </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobrovsky </PERSON> said that in one month the Civic Forum office has collected the equivalent of more than $ 38,000, and that should cover expenses for about a month. Some money has been spent for thousands of posters supporting <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, a playwright often jailed during Communist rule and now the main opposition candidate for president. The Svoboda print shop kept its presses rolling day and night Monday and Tuesday producing <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> posters. Crowds gathers as the posters were pasted up and some people tore them down to take home. A young girl from a town near <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> said she was `` taking a few to put up where I live. When they are gone I will come and get some more. It's hard to imagine free elections.''

 A woman convicted of passing bad checks pleaded for a lenient sentence by inviting the court to look at her sterling record as a scholar and a teacher. The judge did _ and found out she was also a liar. <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> was sentenced Monday to the maximum 15 years in prison on two bad check charges and one count of grand theft. The sentence was imposed after her last-ditch plea for leniency in which she noted that the state earlier had offered 18 months. The 32-year-old defendant claimed to have a bachelor's degree in English literature from Holy Cross, a master's degree from <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and six years' teaching at a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> high school. A presentence investigation portrayed what she had hoped _ a picture of a person who just made a mistake.

There's no excuse, no justification.'' `` I would seriously doubt almost anything you tell me now,'' the judge said.

 <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was sentenced Tuesday to four years in prison and fined $ 7.1 million by a federal judge who ignored her sobbing plea for mercy and blamed the hotel queen's tax evasion on `` naked greed.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> also sentenced Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 69, to three years of probation and 750 hours of community service at <ORGANIZATION> Hale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a home for infants born addicted to drugs. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> _ said to have boasted to a maid, `` We do n't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.'' _ was also ordered to repay nearly $ 1.7 million in back taxes and bear the government's costs in bringing her to justice `` Your conduct was a product of naked greed. ... You believed you were above the law and displayed no remorse or contrition,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> told Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>. He said she shirked a `` moral responsibility to uphold the law'' that came with her position, breaking the law `` consciously and repeatedly.'' `` No person,'' he said, `` no matter how wealthy and prominent, stands above the law.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> allowed Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> to remain free pending a decision on her appeal of her Aug. 30 conviction on 33 counts of tax evasion. Should her appeals fail and she goes to prison, she would be eligible for parole after serving a year and three months. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> could have been sentenced to 127 years in prison if she had been given the maximum sentence for each of her convictions and been ordered to serve them consecutively, which is rare. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, wearing a black dress with a gold pendant, told <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> before sentencing, `` I am more humiliated and ashamed than anybody can ever imagine that I've been found guilty of a serious crime. ... `` I feel like I'm in the middle of a nightmare,'' she said, her 80-year-old husband, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, sitting three rows away. `` I beg you, do n't let me lose <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> too,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> said, sobbing, her cheeks flushed and stained with tears. `` Our whole life has been work and each other. Please do n't. We have nothing else.'' But she was stone-faced as she left the courthouse with her husband. `` Four years in jail, you should have got more,'' shouted someone in a crowd of bystanders that stood by as she left. The sentiment was shared by many in the crowd who saw <PERSON> Mrs </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> as the embodiment of a greedy decade in which inside traders and savings and loan executives grabbed lucre and headlines. Since her indictment, Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> has been vilified in court and out. She was a high-profile target; her picture appears in nearly every ad for the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>' 27 hotels. The ad for <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Helmsley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> describes it as `` the only palace in the world where the queen stands guard.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s attorney described her as a `` tough bitch'' in opening arguments. The prosecutor, in his closing, described her `` selfishness, greed and sheer arrogance.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and her husband were worth a billion dollars. But she was convicted of evading more than $ 1.2 million in federal taxes between 1983 and 1985 by billing personal expenses through the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> business. Those expenses included construction of an elaborate, $ 1.1 million enclosure for the swimming pool at the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s 28-room mansion in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, along with a $ 130,000 indoor-outdoor sound system Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> fancied after seeing a similar system at Disney World. There were other expenses: $ 58 for leg waxing, $ 21 for a membership in a crossword club, several purchases of lingerie and underwear. Employees who testified at her trial described her as a capricious, despotic boss who fired people on a whim. When she balked at paying a contractor who built an outdoor barbecue pit at the estate, an employee reminded her that the man had six children. He should have kept his pants on, she replied. These revelations led <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> to describe her as `` the wicked witch'' and developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> to call her a `` sick woman.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> told the judge that coverage of the trial had forced her and her husband to hide from the public in their house. Her attorney, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> his client had become a `` lightning rod'' for hate mail, death threats and anti-Semitic remarks. `` She has been ridiculed, abused and humiliated in an unprecedented way, having nothing to do with her wrongdoing.'' He asked that her sentence be limited to community service at <ORGANIZATION> Hale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Prosecutors asked for up to 15 years of prison time. Two employees were tried and convicted along with Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>. Co-defendant <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Licari </PERSON> received 30 months in prison, three years probation and a $ 75,000 fine. Co-defendant <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Turco </PERSON>, another <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> employee, received a two-year term, three years probation and a $ 50,000 fine. Her husband originally was charged, but his case was dropped when it was found his mental capacity had diminished. During the two-hour proceeding Tuesday, <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> dozed; when his wife was sentenced, he watched alertly. To suggestions that <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> would be left alone if Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was sent to prison, prosecutor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> replied: `` At the very least, Mr. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> knowingly acquiesced to Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s insistence that these dealings be carried out. He more than anyone else had the opportunity to see these crimes were not committed and he did n't do it.'' The Helmsleys still face prosecution on charges of evading state taxes; no trial date has been set.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Criticize `Degradable' Plastic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The label `` degradable'' is surfacing on plastic products from trash bags to diapers, but environmentalists call it a marketing ploy that should be rejected. Six environmental groups called Tuesday for a boycott of all degradable plastic products, contending there is no proof that the products will decompose in a landfill any faster than conventional plastics. `` Degradable plastics are a consumer ripoff,'' said <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirka </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based environmental group. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Denison </PERSON> of the Environmental Defense Fund accused manufacturers of `` preying on the environmental concerns of American consumers'' to sell trash bags and other plastic items. `` Degradable plastics may be good for profits, but they are bad for the environment,'' <ORGANIZATION> Denison </ORGANIZATION> said. In recent months, an increasing number of degradable products _ from trash and grocery bags to diapers _ have cropped up on grocery shelves. Manufacturers contend the products made of a plastic compound will degrade in a relatively short time when left to sunlight and, in some cases, even in landfills. The products include Hefty and Glad trash bags and several brands of diapers. Some supermarkets also are increasingly using degradable plastic bags for carrying groceries home because environmentally concerned consumers shy away from conventional plastic bags. Biodegradable plastics are made by adding corn starch to the plastic polymer. <ORGANIZATION> Archer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daniels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures the corn starch additive, maintains that its use will cause the plastic to degrade in a landfill `` within three to five years.'' `` The life of current landfills can be extended by 20 percent while achieving an operational cost savings of 30 percent,'' company vice president <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> said recently when describing the degradable plastic product. `` They will not solve all our solid waste issues, but they have definite advantages if applied properly,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Draeger </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Degradable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a St. Louis-based group made up largely of companies involved in the production or use of degradable plastics. The plastics industry is divided on the issue. `` Degradability is not the solution to the solid waste problem,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, general manager of solid waste management solutions at <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>, which produces Hefty bags, turned to degradable bags because of consumer and competitive pressures, he said. `` We have found ourselves in the position of a strong consumer demand for degradable plastics'' and competitors are providing the product, <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. He said the plastic in Hefty bags will decompose faster than conventional plastic when exposed to sunlight, but responds no different from other plastic when buried. The plastic compound used by <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> is different from the corn starch and plastic polymer mixture that makes up the degradable plastic products advertised as decomposing when buried. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> had no definitive proof that the corn starch mixture will decompose significantly faster in a landfill environment than conventional plastic. The groups calling for the boycott are the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, Environmental Policy Institute-Friends of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, Public Citizen and the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recyclable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Democrats, Republicans Signal Fray Over Defense Cuts</HEAD>

 Democrats and Republicans are clashing over the adequacy of defense cuts being weighed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, even as former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials support larger reductions. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing, held Tuesday to consider the depth of savings that might be found in the defense budget, offered a preview of the partisan clashes likely to dominate debate over the fiscal 1991 budget. While committee Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., argued that military spending can be reduced well below current levels, ranking Republican <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> insisted that cutbacks must be deliberate and well studied <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said that as a result of the military buildup of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, this year's $ 285 billion <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget is $ 70 billion above the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peacetime average since World War II, excluding the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war years. `` Those massive expenditures have ... diverted us from the enterprise of building a sounder, more productive domestic economy,'' he said. <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, however, warned that a reduction of the defense budget will have to occur slowly and will not necessarily be an economic panacea. `` Will it solve the problems relating to health care costs?'' he asked. `` Will it make our children study harder in school? Will it make Americans more productive?'' Former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> and another one-time top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official called for military cuts surpassing those the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is considering. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Korb </PERSON> sought to justify their separate proposals by citing a need to address domestic problems and react to the easing of East-West tensions. `` In the face of ... economic and social problems, it would be folly to spend more than we need for defense,'' <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, who served as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary under Presidents <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, told the committee. `` We are doing so.'' <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> called for holding military spending to $ 290 billion in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, and cutting it gradually to $ 265 billion in 1994. <PERSON> Korb </PERSON>, assistant defense secretary for manpower and reserve policy from 1981 to 1985, said pressures created by the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s arms reduction proposals make the time right for cuts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense outlays. `` There is no doubt that the combination of Gramm-Rudman-Gorbachev can and should drive the level of defense spending down by about 25 percent'' over the next five years, <PERSON> Korb </PERSON> told the lawmakers. Under his proposal, the defense budget would drop to $ 225 billion by 1995. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is studying cutting the projected rate of growth for <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending by up to $ 180 billion over 1992 to 1994, reductions that would still leave military outlays above $ 290 billion for each of those years.

<HEAD>Bogus Health Plans May Leave Workers Without Benefits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Thousands of workers risk being stuck with paying their own medical bills because of bogus insurance plans that the federal government allows but does n't police, authorities say. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to monitor so-called multiple employer welfare arrangements `` are sorely lacking or are non-existent,'' <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, deputy insurance commissioner in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on legislation and national security on Tuesday. The arrangements, which pool health care coverage for small employers who ca n't get coverage from larger insurance carriers, were created under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act. States generally regulate insurance and require cash reserves to back claims, witnesses told the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee The health insurance arrangements generally do not maintain reserves to pay claims, said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, acting inspector general for the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> acknowledged that the reserve requirements would hurt many beneficial operators. `` With the expectation of staying afloat for a period of time through aggressive selling and slow claims payment, these fraudulent -LRB- arrangements -RRB- have become a variation of the classic Ponzi scheme,'' <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> said. Many operators abscond with the funds, leaving the workers high and dry, the two witnesses said. Some 5 million such arrangements exist nationwide, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> said. The number of fraudulent ones is unknown. State enforcement agencies have been frustrated `` by multi-state fraud schemes, limited resources and historical unresponsiveness'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Both <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said the operators try to escape state enforcement by claiming that the federal government has jurisdiction. But Ms. <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said her efforts to bring in the federal government bore no fruit. She said she was shuttled between the Office of Inspector General and the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> until she finally gave up and used what state court action she could in an investigation begun in 1988. She said she could n't even get a list of operators. `` You are not required to obtain a license or certificate of authority to operate from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. She said she was investigating two operators. One ran programs known as the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Timber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>; and one ran a program known as the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loggers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. By the time she obtained a state court order, the operator of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loggers </ORGANIZATION> had left the state with the program funds and `` hundreds of consumers in some six states with thousands _ probably hundreds of thousands _ of dollars of unpaid medical claims and with no medical coverage.'' `` To date I know of no criminal, civil or other disciplinary action taken or planned by any division of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> or any other entity,'' she said, adding that the operator, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, has settled in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and is setting up another plan. Unpaid medical claims for the other companies total at least $ 100,000.

<HEAD>Next Federal Budget Based on Optimistic Assumptions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will base its next budget on an optimistic economic forecast showing moderate growth, lower inflation and unemployment holding steady, administration sources say. The sources, who spoke on condition that their names not be used, said the administration is expected to forecast that the economy, as measured by the gross national product, will expand by 2.6 percent next year. That GNP figure, based on growth from the fourth quarter of this year through the fourth quarter of 1990, is significantly higher than the outlook of most private economists, many of whom are looking for weak growth of around 1.9 percent next year. The administration sources said the GNP forecast has not received final approval from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but they said the number is unlikely to change significantly. The administration's economic outlook, which will be formally released on Jan. 22 along with its 1991 budget proposal, is prepared based on information supplied by economists at the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The administration's last formal review of the economy, released in July, also projected economic growth of 2.6 percent for 1990. The sources said the predictions made in July on inflation and unemployment would be very close to the figures used in the next budget. In its July review, the administration forecast that inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, would rise 4.1 percent in 1990 following a 5 percent increase this year. Through October, consumer prices were rising at an annual rate of 4.6 percent. The administration's July forecast predicted unemployment will average 5.4 percent in 1990. That prediction is also viewed as optimistic by many private ecoomists given the fact that the unemployment rate has already risen to 5.4 percent with higher joblessness expected in the months ahead as the current dramatic slowdown in growth spreads through the economy. While stressing that the final decision on the forecast has not been made, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` It is safe to say that because the economy has performed fairly closely to what we were forecasting back -LRB- in July -RRB- ... that unless something radical changes, it is unlikely that the macroeconomic assumptions would change very much.'' Through the first three quarters of this year, the economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.9 percent. But many analysts believe growth in the current quarter and the first three months of 1990 could dip perilously close to a recession. Blue Chip Economic Indicators, which surveys 51 economists every month, is predicting the economy will grow by 1.9 percent for all of 1990, far below the administration's 2.6 percent estimate. While the difference is small in percentage terms, every 1 percentage point of lower growth translates into $ 25 billion in lost revenue for the government, making it more difficult for the administration to meet its goal of reducing the deficit without raising taxes. For the current fiscal year, the deficit reduction target in the Gramm-Rudman law is $ 100 billion. For the 1991 fiscal year, which begins next Oct. 1, the deficit target is $ 64 billion. The actual deficit in the 1989 fiscal year was $ 152.1 billion. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said he believed weak economic growth will push the current deficit as high as $ 140 billion, pushing the 1991 target of $ 64 billion even further out of reach.

 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials say they doubt a new peace agreement signed by five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents will contribute to negotiated settlements to the conflicts in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Tuesday the administration `` remains to be convinced'' that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government will live up to its renewed promises to carry out democratic reforms. `` We're certainly skeptical,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, speaking hours after the five presidents ended marathon discussions in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. He said alleged Sandinista-sponsored violence at opposition campaign rallies has raised questions about the government's commitment to free and fair elections in February and its willingness to allow the safe return of Contra rebels from their Honduran base camps <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the fact that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> agreed not to support the Marxist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> was `` encouraging.'' He added that the administration also was pleased to see the invitation for the Contras to register to vote if they do so before a Feb. 5 deadline. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, deputy spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> responded positively to the summit communique's comments on <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, noting that it expressed support for the country's embattled government and called on leftist rebels to cease hostilities immediately But two officials, speaking privately, said they doubted that the communique would have a significant impact on the thinking of the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> rebels. Sen. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said there is diminishing congressional support for Salvadoran President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> based on the perception that he is unable to control the Salvadoran military. `` If there were a vote today on aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, at the least aid would be cut off,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said. There is a widespread impression in the administration and on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> that the Salvadoran military was responsible for the massacre of six Jesuit priests a month ago. The communique calls for the demobilization of both the Contras and the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> had asked for a Dec. 31 deadline for the dismantling of the Contras but his Central American colleagues rejected the request, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. A member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership, Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., demanded that the administration `` end all direct aid to the Contras _ all aid, of any type. `` The administration can no longer live with the fiction that it is supporting the peace process while bypassing the Central American presidents,'' said <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, who supported the $ 49 million humanitarian aid package when it came to a vote last April. When the presidents last met in <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, four months ago, a Dec. 5 deadline was set for dismantling the Contras but that target came and went with the rebels still intact. Most are deployed at camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> near the border with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. On the issue of alleged Nicaraguan efforts to support the Salvadoran insurgency, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> noted the communique asks that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> accelerate the deployment of observers whose mandate it is to verify that countries do not interfere in the internal affairs of their neighbors. Other officials said the first <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> units, known by the initials <LOCATION> ONUCA </LOCATION>, have arrived in the region and that the operation should be at full strength after Christmas. Meanwhile, three <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members complained they were forced to cancel a planned trip to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to inspect election preparations when they were told at the last minute it would take an additional 10 days to process their visas. One of the trio, Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, said other members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> seeking to visit <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> before the elections planned for February 25 also are experiencing difficulty in obtaining visas. <PERSON> DeLay </PERSON> and Reps. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Oxley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., attributed the delay to a desire by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to prevent them from observing alleged attacks by <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> supporters on political opponents

 Comedy is still king in the <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>'s weekly ratings book as sitcoms held the top six spots. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show'' was first again, and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne'' moved up to third place behind <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers,'' according to the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings for last week's prime-time shows. <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>'s ratings, as well as his assurance he wants to do another season at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, is good news for the first-place network. Despite published reports that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had sought his show, <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> said he wanted to stay with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. CBS had negotiated with producers <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carsey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> for their services as programming chiefs and purchase of their company, which produces `` Cosby'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the week survey by more than 2 ratings points. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had an average of 14.2 to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s 11.9 and CBS' 11.3. Each point is the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million homes with televisions tuned to a show. For the season, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> leads with a 15.0 average to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s 13.3 and CBS' 12.2. Once again, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> placed its entire Thursday night schedule, plus two comedies from Saturday, in the top 10. Here are last week's top shows: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show'' and `` Cheers''; <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne''; <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` A Different World,'' `` Dear <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' and `` The Golden Girls''; <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` 60 Minutes'' and `` Murder, She Wrote''; <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` L.A. Law'' and `` Empty Nest.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to move `` Dear John'' from Thursday to Wednesday in early January could be bad news for the show starring <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> will replace it on Thursday with a new show, `` Grand,'' from the <ORGANIZATION> Carsey-Werner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> said at a televised briefing for affiliate stations Monday that he felt `` Dear <PERSON> John </PERSON>'' was strong enough to survive the move and would be compatible with `` Night Court. He defended giving the coveted Thursday spot to `` Grand,'' saying the show needed nurturing and that <ORGANIZATION> Carsey-Werner </ORGANIZATION> had done well. Three CBS Monday night comedies improved their ratings. `` Designing Women'' moved up to 18th place. `` Newhart'' was 21st and `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'' was tied for 26th. <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s top-rated show is `` Married ...

<HEAD>1989 Cotton Crop to be Smaller Than Previous Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Agriculture Department says the 1989 cotton crop is expected to be slightly less than 12.1 million bales, down 22 percent from last year's harvest but virtually the same as estimated in November. In its new estimate Tuesday, based on field conditions as of Dec. 1, the department's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said a 20 percent drop in the acreage for harvest and slightly lower yields account for the decline from 1988 levels. Overall, cotton farmers had 9.53 million acres for harvest this fall, down 20 percent from 1988. The yield is expected to average 608 pounds per acre, down 11 pounds from last year but up a pound from the November forecast. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> states experienced favorable weather during harvest and show an increase from last month,'' the report said. `` In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, an October freeze lowered expected yields.'' But cotton harvest made good progress last month in the Plains and could be completed ahead of normal, the report said. By Dec. 3, the harvest was 89 percent completed in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, compared with 75 percent a year earlier and the average of 60 percent. Orange production was forecast at 194 million boxes, unchanged from the previous forecast two months ago based on Oct. 1 indications, but 6 percent below last season. `` This decline is due mostly to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 11 percent decrease from last season,'' the report said. `` Freezing weather in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> during late February killed some of the open bloom and damaged new growth.'' The report also indicated dry edible bean production this year at 24.1 million hundredweight, up 25 percent from last year's drought-reduced harvest but still 7 percent short of 1987 production Acreage for harvest was up 24 percent from last year and the average yield, at 1,436 pounds per acre, was up 1 percent. <PERSON> Burley </PERSON> tobacco production was estimated at 543 million pounds, up 14 percent from 1988 but fractionally below the November forecast. The area for harvest is up 13 percent from last year and the average yield is up 18 pounds per acre. No new estimates were issued for the major field crops such as corn, wheat and soybeans. In a related report, the department's world outlook board said prospective levels of cotton production and use in 1989 remain at near the levels indicated last month, although production prospects are up on a few foreign countries. `` This likely will mean reduced needs for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cotton in world markets and lower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export prospects,'' the report said. The global outlook for wheat is `` largely unchanged'' from the November forecast, the report said. For corn, sorghum, oats and other so-called coarse grains, 1989-90 production and inventories a year from now are expected to be down marginally from last month's outlook `` Larger output is forecast for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>,'' the report said. `` However, these gains are more than offset by smaller crops in the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and several other countries.''

 Private exporting companies have sold the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> an additional 103,632 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn for delivery in 1989-90 under a long-term supply agreement. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that the corn was shifted by exporters from `` unknown destinations'' to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for 1989-90 delivery. Orders since Oct. 1, the beginning of the agreement's new year, total 160,700 tons of soybeans, 705,000 tons of soybean meal and 7,300 tons of barley. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain sales to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1988-89 were a record of more than 21.7 million tons, including more than 16.3 million tons of corn and nearly 5.4 million tons of wheat. In addition, 1988-89 sales included 298,700 tons of soybeans, 1.35 million tons of soybean meal and 1.02 million tons of grain sorghums. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 103,632 tons of corn would be about 4.1 million bushels. The new sales were made by unidentified private exporting companies, which are required to report large sales to the department. No selling prices or further details were released. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.22 per bushel at the farm level, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s five-day average, meaning that the latest sale could have a farm value of about $ 9 million.

 Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> says that among the things <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> needs to boost food production are agricultural chemicals, currently the target of environmentalists and federal regulators in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We need to do whatever we can to improve agricultural productivity in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` Interestingly, there were two principal requests in this area.''

But the aid package approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does n't include such chemicals, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said `` There's little that we can do, perhaps nothing that we can do in the way of agricultural chemicals from a governmental standpoint.'' Thus, he said, the private sector may have to meet <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s request for farm chemicals through grants and donations <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> recently led a presidential mission to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to help determine what kind of aid may be needed to help that country rebuild its agriculture.

 AIDS groups around the country are applauding a recommendation that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration stop screening international visitors for the AIDS virus. `` The HIV policies now enforced by the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> are hypocritical, racist and homophobic and must be abolished,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Christen </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS made public a resolution Tuesday urging the government to stop asking visitors to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if they are infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus -LRB- HIV -RRB-, which causes AIDS, and to quit marking the passports of those who are. At least 36 national organizations, including the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> endorsed the new immigration resolution. Current policies infringe on human rights and dignity `` and they reinforce a false impression that AIDS and HIV infection are a general threat,'' said Dr. <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON>, who chairs the commission. `` In fact they are sharply restricted in their mode of transmission.'' `` This policy is discriminatory, it is unjust, it violates basic human rights, it inflicts unnecessary hardship and embarrassment on an already suffering community,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Carman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemophilia </ORGANIZATION>. `` For too long irrationality, rather than public health, has governed in this area,'' said <PERSON> Chai </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldblum </PERSON>, legislative counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s AIDS project. The commission said the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> routinely questions some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visitors to learn if they are infected by HIV and that this has already caused several international groups and agencies to boycott important conferences to be held in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> next summer. Unless the restrictions are eased, said several spokesmen for groups concerned with AIDS, many international participants are expected to stay away from the 6th International Conference on AIDS, in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> June 20-24, and the 19th <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Hemophilia, scheduled for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in August. The commission called for immediate administrative steps to end questioning of tourists, students and temporary visitors about their HIV status while applying for visas. `` This would eliminate the current practice of stopping travelers who are carrying AZT, the only licensed anti-HIV drug, and blood products such as clotting factor used by hemophiliacs,'' the commission said. Travel restrictions for people with HIV began two years ago when Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, succeeded in adding HIV to a list of dangerous contagious diseases considered by the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. A waiver process was instituted a year ago for professional conferences, business travel and medical conferences, but a code is placed on the passports of those who receive such waivers. Dr. <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> that the rules should be changed because `` the policy is not going to serve any significant public health service but the potential for discrimination is significant with a code in your passport known to everybody.'' The resolution called for a comprehensive review by the <ORGANIZATION> Departments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> of immigration policies relating to communicable diseases, especially HIV infection.

 Maybe it's sheer lunacy, but thousands of people have called a 900 number to find out the weather on the moon. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> started its 1-900-WEATHER line Aug. 1, providing temperatures and forecasts for 600 places around the world, and one place out of this world. It turns out more people have called for the moon's weather than any other location, except <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the company reported Tuesday. `` I think we've struck a whimsical chord among callers,'' said <PERSON> Jess </PERSON> <PERSON> Bander </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> vice president. `` There's a sense of wonderment about the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>, a fanciful enjoyment.''

In case you're wondering, it's hot on the sunny half of the moon, about 264 degrees, and cold on the dark half, about minus 272. It's been like that for millions of years, and the information is in most encyclopedias. But for 75 cents a minute, callers can hear that the relative humidity on the airless orb is zero percent and that winds are calm. If you push a button to get travel reminders, they include, `` A working space suit and air supply are required.''

<HEAD>Two Senators Sought Last-Minute Sale of Lincoln S&amp;L</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two senators contend their last-ditch bid to back the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, and head off its seizure by federal regulators, was an effort to save taxpayers a record bailout cost. Aides to Sens. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., acknowledge that the lawmakers were lobbied to back the sale last spring by a former <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> congressman, Republican <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rousselot </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> owner <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a major contributor to their campaigns and <PERSON> Rousselot </PERSON> headed the group that sought to buy the S & amp; L. But the senators' discussions with the top thrift regulator _ just days before the government seized <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> on April 14 _ were motivated by a desire to prevent an expected record $ 2 billion-plus government bailout of a savings and loan, the aides said in recent interviews. The Lincoln collapse has brought multiple investigations and lawsuits, including a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> review of intervention by <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> and three other senators: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, The five received $ 1.3 million from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, his immediate family and employees, but all five deny any connection between the money and their intervention with regulators. In the frantic week before the seizure of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> discussed a possible sale with <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, the head of the government's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> who announced his resignation last week. The contacts are listed in Wall's office phone logs and memos, and it was confirmed by spokesmen for the senators and Wall that the <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> sale was discussed. A sale of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> could have allowed <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ the bank's parent company _ to avoid its filing for bankruptcy protection on April 13. <PERSON> Rousselot </PERSON>, who led a prospective buyers' group just before the seizure, said, `` I was lobbying to try to get a sale accomplished.'' <PERSON> Rousselot </PERSON>, in an interview, added that most of his discussions were with <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> or his staff. <PERSON> Rousselot </PERSON> said he learned right before the senators' phone calls that a seizure might be imminent. He said he was told by a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> that `` It's a good thing you've got this group together'' because otherwise the board staff was preparing to recommend that <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> `` be put into conservatorship.'' The board took such action after rejecting the <PERSON> Rousselot </PERSON> deal as inadequate, as it had done with two previous offers. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> Chief of Staff <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenaway </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rousselot </PERSON> wanted the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> senator to ask Wall to let <PERSON> Rousselot </PERSON> `` present his case'' before top banking officials. The senator passed on the request, and <PERSON> Rousselot </PERSON> said he did speak directly with the top officials. The aide, who attended the session, said <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> told the regulator he `` did n't have any idea of whether the offer by the <PERSON> Rousselot </PERSON> group met their standards and did n't want to prejudge that. But if the sale did meet their standards and there was no reason to object, he urged the sale be approved to save the taxpayers money.'' <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON> said that in the last-ditch discussions to avoid a takeover, <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> asked Wall, `` Is there any way for a sale to go through so <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> could be out and the institution could be saved, so jobs would not be lost and taxpayers would not have to foot another savings and loan bill? The answer he got back in all cases, was ` no.''' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s chief spokesman did not return telephone calls to comment on the lobbying effort. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>'s spokesman and chief of congressional affairs, said the calls from the senators to Wall were `` appropriate because we were not being asked to make any conclusions. We were not being asked to make a deal,'' but were advised `` if there was a deal, move on it quickly.'' He said banking officials also hoped for a sale because `` it was the least expensive way to solve the problem. It was less costly than paying it off or taking it over.''

At Christmas time, he turns into <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> _ in appearances at schools, parks and churches, but always in poor areas. He spends a portion of his retirement fund each year on toys. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said he plays <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> because he likes people, especially kids. `` With the kids,'' he said, `` It's easier to let it out.'' Silver-haired and jolly most of the time, the retired furniture maker's representative drives a hard bargain when he's collecting promised donations for his charitable work. `` Well, you tell that no-good -LRB- so-and-so -RRB- to come up with something,'' he was overheard telling one donor during a recent interview.

 Lucky for Thakorial Mistry, there are no sacred cows in his business. Mistry is probably the only Hindu taxidermist in the world. It might seem strange that a Hindu would make a living stuffing and mounting animals, for Hindus revere living creatures and believe in reincarnation. The people in his hometown outside <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, were mostly vegetarians and would never kill an animal, he said. Only the poorest and hungriest would eat a chicken, but only behind closed doors. No wonder that <PERSON> Mistry </PERSON> was considered an oddball _ or worse _ when he began his boyhood hobby of taxidermy. His first specimen was a pigeon, which he grabbed in the rafters of his home, chloroformed and stuffed with cotton. `` It did n't turn out real good but it looked good to me, until it started to smell,'' Mistry said. The boy bagged small birds and chipmunks with a BB gun and stuffed them in the privacy of his attic bedroom. Mistry's secret escaped the notice of his father, the town blacksmith and a devout Hindu, but his neighborhood pals were fascinated. `` I always enjoyed opening animals,'' he said. `` I love animals. My friends thought I was crazy, but when I finished they thought I had created something beautiful. Even my parents, when they found out, they liked it too.'' Mistry arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1971 with a degree in chemistry and zoology, about $ 6 in his pocket and plans for a career in medical technology. However, he said, `` my hobby turned into a living.'' After an apprenticeship with taxidermy shops in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, he went into business for himself in 1976. His large studio in this rural community south of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> is filled with striking examples of Mistry's artistry, including deer, bear, bison, pheasant, peacocks, fish and big game from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Beneath a mounted shark, a red fox leaps after a pair of grouse rising in flight. Two gamecocks lunge in battle, their neck feathers bristling. Mistry, 43, assisted by his wife <PERSON> Jyotsna </PERSON>, stuffs about 1,000 creatures annually, at prices ranging from $ 6 an inch for freshwater fish to as much as $ 2,000 for a grizzly bear. Business is profitable enough for Mistry, who became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen in 1979, to support his family of four and to help nearly two dozen relatives immigrate from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Lounging on the marble floor of his showroom is one customer's unclaimed white Pekinese dog, one of many small pets that Mistry has lovingly freeze-dried for their grieving owners The Pekinese would make a dandy doorstop, but <PERSON> Mistry </PERSON> says it's so lifelike that `` it makes a good guard dog'' to scare would-be intruders peering through the windows Mistry recalls with a grin the time a husband called to ask, `` Can you stuff my wife?'' On another occasion, a lawyer telephoned to say his client had written a will requesting that his body be freeze-dried. Mistry turned them both down. `` I could do a human being, but it's illegal,'' he said. `` Even if it were legal, I would n't do it.'' How does he feel about stuffing a cow, the most sacred animal in the Hindu religion? `` Sure, I could do a cow,'' Mistry replied. `` No problem. You've got to change to survive wherever you go This is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are hailing the stiff sentences handed to a pair of Mexican drug lords convicted of masterminding the torture-slayings of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> narcotics agent and his pilot. `` My heartfelt congratulations go to the government of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and its judicial authorities for their decisive and correct action,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, 37, and <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonesca </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON>, 56, were convicted Tuesday of masterminding the 1985 murders of <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and his Mexican pilot and sentenced to 40 years in prison. `` There is no chance of these sentences being reduced,'' Attorney General <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, a spokesman for the attorney general, said <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> would have to serve a total of 74 and 53 years respectively because of other drug-related convictions. There is no parole in drug-related cases. Lawn said the stiff sentences are `` tantamount to life imprisonment'' and send a stern warning to other drug kinpins. He said it shows that `` no matter how wealthy and powerful their infamous trade has made these narco-murderers, they are not beyond the reach of justice.'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, also praised the convictions and the sentences. `` It's certainly nice to see people like <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> off the streets,'' he said. `` I think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will both be the better for it.'' The <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> case badly strained relations between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in its early stages because <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> authorities allowed <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> to escape to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> virtually shut down the border at one point by searching every Mexican and vehicle trying to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> acting Deputy Administrator <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that he personally informed <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s widow and sister of the convictions. `` It was good to be able to call them with good news for once,'' he said. `` They were very pleased that this action was taken by the courts of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> was a middleman for Colombian cocaine cartels smuggling drugs to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. His story and the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> killing were the subject of a book and television movie in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, both called `` Desperados.'' He and <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> were tried earlier this year. The convictions and sentences were announced Tuesday by Judge <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> of the 4th <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, a major drug trafficking center 350 miles west of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Camerena </PERSON> was based. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agent was kidnapped there on Feb. 7, 1985. His pilot, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> <PERSON> Avelar </PERSON>, was abducted a few days later. Their bullet-riddled bodies were found on March 5 in shallow graves on a ranch 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Jalisco </LOCATION> state. Both <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> are multi-millionaires whose assets include ranches, aircraft, luxury cars, houses, apartments, hotels and businesses which the government is in the process of confiscating. <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> also were sentenced Tuesday on several other kidnapping, drug trafficking and weapons charges related to the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> case. The sentences, which will be served concurrently, add up to 116 years for <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> and 144 for <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> was sentenced to 34 years in another drug case earlier this year and <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> was given 13 years. These sentences will run consecutively to those in the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> case. Ten other men were sentenced to the maximum term of 40 years for taking part in the killings, and 13 other men received lesser sentences for their involvement in drug operations run by <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON>.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: The Peace Dividend and Bush's 60 Minutes of Gloom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is throwing himself with verve into crafting a 1991 budget, trying to decide how to apply a `` peace dividend'' while admitting his own budget chief sometimes gives him `` 60 minutes of gloom.'' The peace dividend is the savings that will come from lower defense spending because of reduced tensions in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Although some of his predecessors have approached budget choices with disdain, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been going over next year's budget line-by-line in excruciating detail, according to top aides. He's had no trouble playing Solomon in refereeing battles between agency heads and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. On defense spending, for instance, he simply split the difference between the $ 294 billion in defense outlays sought by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and the $ 290 billion proposed by <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>. Sources said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided on a final figure of $ 292 billion _ up just $ 1 billion from the current level _ for military spending in the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will submit his fiscal 1991 budget to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 22. White House and <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> officials say they expect to have final figures locked in sometime after Christmas. Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, the 1991 budget must reduce the deficit to no more than $ 64 billion. Since the current year deficit is expected to be from $ 100 billion to $ 105 billion, that suggests <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must come up with $ 30 billion to $ 40 billion in budget savings. `` We've got enormous budget problems facing me,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently told a group of reporters who interviewed him in the Oval Office. `` I feel very strongly about it because <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> just walked out _ and when you see him walking out, I go through a period of about 60 minutes of gloom before I refocus on what else is happening out there,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> is fast earning a reputation as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Christmas Scrooge. And, as some well-placed aides tell it, he's living up to the characterization placed on him by former colleague and onetime Budget Director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>: `` He was always asking inconvenient questions, or seemingly preoccupied with the process _ tactics, trades, deals, winning.'' `` It's that time of year. It's December _ time for Christmas and arm-wrestling with <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>,'' said drug policy director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who has had his own feuds with <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> over spending on the war on drugs. The multimillion-dollar disputes with <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> are common, said presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` There's millions and millions of dollars -LRB- in differences -RRB- between every agency and <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, a master at strategy, this year devised a new process under which Cabinet officers who do not want to negotiate cuts in their programs with the <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> can take their appeals directly to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ but at a risk. The risk is that if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turns down their appeal or does not decide to split the difference as he did with <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, they would have to compete among themselves for a small pool of money reserved for high-priority programs. Some Cabinet members have told <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> no thanks, and have taken their appeals to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> anyway _ including <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who saw <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday. Still, White House officials say <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s new process has cut down on the number of direct budget appeals to the president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has suggested he will ask for small increases in education, environmental and crime programs and will renew his request for a child care tax credit. He also is expected to propose additional Medicare reductions and a lower capital gains tax. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insists that any `` peace dividend'' that results from a cut in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will not be spent on other programs. A student at a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> high school asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week: `` What are you proposing to do with that money?'' `` It's to pay off the deficit,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Suggestions that defense savings be used to fund domestic programs are `` some crazy ... wild speculation,'' the president said. `` I will not acquiesce in that.''

 An aging police dog whose transfer to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> provoked protests by congressmen and schoolchildren, is returning to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. The German shepherd named <PERSON> Magoo </PERSON> was transferred in September by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, spurring petitions and angry letters. `` There's no telling how many letters the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> may have received,'' police Sgt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrowski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Magoo </PERSON>'s former partner and guardian, said Tuesday. <PERSON> Magoo </PERSON> first moved to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> six years ago as part of an airport security program. Though assigned to the city dog squad, he remained <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> property. <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> police withdrew from the airport program about a year ago, and the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> subsequently decided to transfer <PERSON> Magoo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Petrowski </PERSON> collected 7,000 names on a petition he sent to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. And among those writing on <PERSON> Magoo </PERSON>'s behalf were Gov. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators and two congressmen. `` One teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Bartlett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> called me and said she had used -LRB- newspaper -RRB- stories about <PERSON> Magoo </PERSON> in her class,'' <PERSON> Petrowski </PERSON> said. `` They had all written letters to the president and letters to their pen pals, telling them to write letters to the president to try to get him back.'' <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said his agency reviewed <PERSON> Magoo </PERSON>'s transfer again and agreed to return him to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> on the city's promise he would be available for airport bomb duty if needed. <PERSON> Petrowski </PERSON> said <PERSON> Magoo </PERSON> will continue his general police assignments and any needed airport work, but at 8 years old, the dog likely will retire in a year or two. <PERSON> Magoo </PERSON> has lived with <PERSON> Petrowski </PERSON> and his family when off duty and is expected to spend his retirement there as well. `` I'm just as happy as I can be,'' <PERSON> Petrowski </PERSON> said, adding that he expects <PERSON> Magoo </PERSON> to be home in about a week.

 Like their country-and-western counterparts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, these songs are filled with girlfriends and gunplay, betrayal and bloodshed. The heroes of the popular Mexican songs, however, are cocaine traffickers. And the villain is often <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug enforcement policy. The exploits of drug traffickers _ and sometimes their tragic fates _ are romanticized in ballads such as `` Death of a Snitch,'' `` The Mafia Dies,'' `` White Load,'' `` The Red Car Gang'' and `` Contraband and Treason.'' `` The Mafia Dies'' by <PERSON> Pepe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON> is a classic `` corrido,'' or Mexican storytelling ballad, filled with nostalgia for the way things were before a great shootout in <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> state wiped out whole families of `` narcotraficantes.'' `` <LOCATION> Tierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanca </LOCATION> is so sad and its streets are deserted,'' goes the refrain to a slow oom-pah-pah beat and an accordion's lamenting counterpoint. `` New cars do n't cruise there and the roar of machine guns is heard no more. The mansions of those who were kings are today abandoned.'' The popularity of ballads about smuggling illustrates how attitudes can differ on the supply side of the drug problem. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is a shipper, not a consumer or even much of a producer. The drug trade has bestowed wealth, not crack houses and cocaine babies. In the supply-side subculture, cocaine kingpins can be popular heroes, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoods </PERSON> who take from rich, decadent gringos and give to poor Mexicans. They are often philanthropists who command their community's loyalty like benevolent feudal lords. Their foot soldiers are daring men who brave hails of bullets, fierce `` federales'' and treachery. By tradition, corridos comment on current events, on the famous _ and the infamous. Many of the old songs are about revolutionaries. The smuggling corridos are a contemporary variation that coincides with the rise in the drug trade in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Shortly after <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> was arrested in the 1985 murder of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent, a `` corrido'' to him appeared. `` It took 10 federal agents to guard him because he was a fine fighting cock,'' the song goes. `` Guys like that are n't born every day.'' <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, a key Mexican link with the Colombian cartels, also is compared to the lion, a king of beasts even when caged: `` The beast is now behind bars, but you can hear his roar in the midnight hours.'' Although traditional Mexican music is popular in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, smuggling songs are not, perhaps because they are of more recent vintage. But collectors and music industry executives believe they have a select following in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, where one cocaine kingpin, the billionaire <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, is such an aficionado of things Mexican that his nickname is `` El Mexicano.'' Some smuggling corridos are distinctly anti-American in tone.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Bill to Trigger New Steel Trade Program With 28 Nations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is extending steel import restraints on 28 trading partners, while giving the nations incentives to stop subsidizing their steel industries. Renewal of the curbs through March 1992 will `` eliminate trade-distorting practices in the steel sector,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a statement Tuesday. The old pacts, negotiated by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1984, expired on Sept. 30. The legislation signed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> authorizes the federal government to continue the curbs for another 2 -LCB- years. The curbs, negotiated individually with leading steel-exporting nations, place annual, product-by-product limits on the volume of steel that can be shipped to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Negotiators in the office of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> announced Tuesday that the talks had been recently completed with all nations targeted by the administration. The talks had to be conducted before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed the bill so that the import program would not lapse. The resulting new pacts will hold the foreign share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel market to 19.1 percent in the first year of the program, <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said in a statement. She said import restraint agreements had been finalized with the 12-nation European Community and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the Peoples Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s signature on the `` Steel Trade Liberalization Act'' had been expected for some time. Not only did <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promise to renew import curbs during the 1988 campaign, but his administration orchestrated a compromise last summer between lawmakers favoring a five-year extension of the restraints and congressional opponents who wanted the program ended. The idea behind the original pacts was to give domestic steelmakers breathing space from subsidized, foreign competition. Many steel-state lawmakers had pushed the administration to extend the curbs for another five years, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opted for a smaller-scale program in deference to steel-using manufacturers. The manufacturers argued that the quotas have driven up prices and caused supply shortages of some steel products. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the country-by-county agreements a `` stepping stone'' to the day when all trade-distorting subsidies could be eliminated. The program is structured to give nations incentives to trade freely. For example, the pacts allow some countries' market shares to rise by 1 percentage point per year until quotas are phased out entirely at the end of the program. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said the yearly increase will be allocated to nations that exhibit the most willingness to stop subsidizing their domestic steelmakers. Some nations have already been granted such status, <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said. She identified those Tuesday as the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION>.

 Legislation that would scrap `` The Star-Spangled Banner'' as the national anthem has riled people in the hometown of <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Key </PERSON>, who wrote the song 175 years ago. `` I honestly feel they should leave it be,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>'s historian. `` I think it's more like a hymn than a song. It brings tears to a lot of people's eyes.'' Rep. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ind </LOCATION>., has introduced legislation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the ninth time in 12 years to supplant it with `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> the Beautiful. <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said Tuesday he thought the campaign for change was being fueled by people who believe the song embraces war and by those who think it's too hard to sing. `` If they ca n't sing it, they ca n't sing,'' <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frederick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION>, said he liked `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> the Beautiful,'' but thinks it's less `` emotionally stirring'' than `` The Star-Spangled Banner.'' The proposal to replace the national anthem also has struck a sensitive chord with the <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Keys </PERSON>, the city's new minor league baseball team. `` His monument -LRB- in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Olivet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> -RRB- faces our new stadium,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeigler </PERSON>, the team's assistant general manager. `` I've got a lot of pride in this area and the state. `` This is something of local significance that is national. It would take away some of the significance.'' <ORGANIZATION> Frederick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Werking </PERSON> said: `` I like ` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> the Beautiful.' I think it is easier to sing, but <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Key </PERSON> being <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>'s native son and having a lot of pride in my community, I do n't think we should change it.'' Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> has written to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation, urging them to oppose any change <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said the protests probably are unnecessary because he does n't think his bill will pass.

 The key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed above the 38,000-point level for the first time Wednesday, while the dollar moved lower against the Japanese yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 258.89 points, or 0.68 percent, ending the day at 38,062.42, yet another high. The index had risen 50.86 points on Tuesday. The dollar ended trading at 143.70 yen, down 0.77 yen from Tuesday's 144.47-yen close. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency opened at 143.80 yen and ranged between 143.35 and 143.90 yen. The dollar remained weaker against other currencies following its slump against the West German mark in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight, said a <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> trader, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unit fell in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where the mark and the Swiss franc surged against the dollar and other major currencies due to the recent pro-democracy movements in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as well as expectations for an interest rate hike in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, dealers said. `` Although the dollar fluctuated less in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, it continued to weaken against the mark, which resulted in the yen's relative strength against the dollar,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> trader said. On the stock exchange, the market's main barometer rose quickly in early trading as overnight gains in the Dow Jones average of 30 major industrial issues in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the yen's recovery against the dollar reassured participants, dealers said. <PERSON> Tomoyuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Morimoto </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said purchases by speculative investors contributed to the index's rise.

<HEAD>Poor Enforcement Allows Violation of Rules in Oil and Gas Leasing
Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is allowing many violations of environmental regulations under its oil and gas leasing program because of lax monitoring, according to an internal audit. The report by the department's Inspector General's Office said Tuesday that oil and gas lease operators on federal or Indian lands `` who commit violations ... often do so without fear of being punished'' because civil penalties are rarely assessed. Even when lease operators are shown to be repeat offenders, their poor record often was swept clean without monetary penalties if corrections on specific violations were made, the investigators added. The report covered the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>'s scrutiny of oil and gas leases throughout the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> during a two-year period beginning in fiscal 1988 Investigators focused on activities in eight bureau offices with jurisdiction over more than 39,000 oil and gas wells, about half of those under the federal program. All the wells are either on federal or Indian land. Bureau spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> said the agency was reviewing the report, but that the bureau agreed generally with many of the findings and recommendations. A formal response by the agency is expected to be completed by February, he said. `` Violations of existing regulations have resulted in environmental damage, lost or unpaid royalties, and a potentially substantial government liability for plugging abandoned wells and cleaning up well sites,'' the report said. The report said that during fiscal 1988, federal inspectors uncovered 1,317 violations of environmental regulations and other infractions but assessed only $ 11,500 in penalties. Among the violations were 277 that were considered `` major,'' the report said. In many cases, however, environmental violations and questionable activities by lease holders went unnoticed because of inadequate checks on well abandonments, venting practices and other activities, the investigators said. Among the findings were: _ Lease operators are being widely allowed to abandon wells without getting required government approval, leaving no clear picture as to how many wells are productive or whether abandoned wells have been properly closed In some cases, wells were found to have been abandoned 15 years or more without an authorized inspectors' approval and certainty of their environmental condition. _ Unauthorized venting or flaring of natural gas, some dating to the 1960s, is widespread among lease operators, posing environmental concerns and preventing the government from collecting royalties _ about $ 291,000 for an estimated 1 billion cubic feet of gas in the limited number of cases documented _ Bonding requirements are inadequate to protect against smaller lease operators abandoning sites without taking proper environmental precautions In many cases, the government will have to assume responsibility. `` There could be a significant number of wells throughout the country which are either plugged improperly or not plugged and ... these wells could be adversely impacting the environment,'' the report said. The cost of potentially capping some 22,000 wells in question was put at more than $ 300 million. Some of the cases cited involved: _ A <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> lease holder who was told he had to test only nine of his 150 wells to determine whether all of them should be considered temporarily closed, operating or be in line for capping `` They did not want to overburden -LRB- him -RRB-,'' the report said. _ A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lease purchaser who was allowed to buy 30 closed or temporarily abandoned wells with a bond of only $ 25,000 After he filed for bankruptcy without capping any of the wells, the government was left with a $ 378,000 bill. _ A lease operator who was shown on videotape dumping extracted saltwater into an unlined, unauthorized pit in violation of environmental regulations Although the operator was told in 35 letters over a two-month period to correct the practice, no monetary penalty was assessed. _ A well on Indian land that blew after a lease holder began extracting natural gas without having conducted promised pressure tests He was fined only $ 5,000 although up to 4 million cubic feet of gas a day were released over 65 days, causing the evacuation of nearby residents and raising concern that local water supplies may have been contaminated.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying `` the times are on the side of peace,'' credits religious faith with helping promote freedom in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.

Because the world, increasingly, is on the side of God,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, an area where the church has at times been critical of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for a renewed commitment to liberty. In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, he condemned `` terrorism and murder, whatever the ideology,'' and promised, `` we will do everything we can to bring to justice those who murdered the six Jesuit priests.'' The six priests were slain along with their housekeeper and her daughter last month by armed men who invaded their rectory at the Jesuit university in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Some church groups have accused government troops of the killings. `` In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, too, we can not rest until liberty's victory is won. We want this to be the first hemisphere made up entirely of free, democratic countries,'' said the president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that at the Dec. 2-3 summit with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, he and the Soviet president talked of `` the freedom to dismantle barriers between nations. And how principles based on conscience can move mountains or _ as in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> _ even move a wall.'' The president recalled that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> before the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit that `` the moral values that religion embodied for centuries can help in the work of renewal of our country'' and that `` this -LRB- renewal -RRB- is already happening.'' `` What a wonderful message for this Christmas season _ a message of the renewal which springs from faith, hope, generosity, freedom,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` What a wonderful legacy to leave our children _ the knowledge that God can live without man, but man can not live without God.'' The dinner honored Cardinals <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Krol </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Krol </PERSON> is retired.

 An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report includes evidence the agency believes could support allegations that Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> used drugs, but it does not recommend whether an indictment should be sought, according to a published report.

After six years of intermittent federal inquiries on the mayor's conduct, the report represents the first focus on a possible case against <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, the newspaper said The sources say the report makes it clear that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has concluded it has obtained enough information for prosecutors to decide whether to seek an indictment against <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported. It was expected to cover the alleged use of illegal drugs by the mayor and whether he committed perjury when he testified before a grand jury in January concerning his relationship with convicted cocaine dealer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who is cooperating with federal investigators, testified Tuesday before the grand jury and was expected to return on Thursday. Sections of the report were sent to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, sources told the paper.

 Billionaire <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> told a judge she was `` in the middle of a nightmare'' before he declared her unremorseful, sentenced her to four years in prison and ordered her to pay $ 8.8 million for tax evasion. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, portrayed as a regal perfectionist in advertisements for her hotel empire, sobbed and begged for mercy at her sentencing Tuesday. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was unswayed, saying `` naked greed'' caused her downfall. `` You believed you were above the law and displayed no remorse or contrition,'' said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. `` You bear the full responsibility for this scheme with all of its fraudulent permutations. ... You were at the apex of the pyramid of wrongdoing.'' Besides prison, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> imposed three years' probation and 750 hours of community service, recommending that she work at a <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> home for infants born addicted to drugs. She would be eligible for parole after 16 months. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> also fined her $ 7.1 million and ordered one other penalty on the woman once said to have boasted to a maid: `` We do n't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.'' She must repay close to $ 1.7 million in back taxes and bear the government's costs in bringing her to justice. `` No person,'' he said, `` no matter how wealthy and prominent, stands above the law.'' As the 69-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> made her tearful appeal to the judge, her ailing 80-year-old husband, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, sat three rows away. `` I am more humiliated and ashamed than anybody can ever imagine that I've been found guilty of a serious crime,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, dressed in black. `` I feel like I'm in the middle of a nightmare. ... `` A few years ago, I lost my only son,'' she said, adding that it `` ripped me apart'' when she saw photographs of his grave published. `` I beg you, do n't let me lose <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, too,'' she said. `` Our whole life has been work and each other. Please do n't. We have nothing else.'' The Helmsleys, with a personal fortune of $ 1 billion, have $ 5 billion in real estate holdings, including 27 hotels and the Empire State Building. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was convicted of evading more than $ 1.2 million in federal taxes between 1983 and 1985 by billing personal expenses through the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> business. She has appealed the Aug. 30 verdict that found her guilty of 33 counts of tax evasion, and she remains free on unspecified bail. After the sentencing, Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> walked down the courthouse steps with her husband while a crowd taunted her. `` Four years in jail, you should have got more,'' shouted one bystander. Among the expenses she was found to have fraudulently billed to her business was the construction of a $ 1.1 million enclosure for the swimming pool of the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s 28-room mansion in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. Other expenses were much smaller _ $ 58 for leg waxing, for example Since her indictment, Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> has been vilified in court and out. She was a high-profile target; her picture is part of nearly every ad for the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>' hotels. The ad for <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Helmsley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> describes it as `` the only palace in the world where the queen stands guard. Even her own lawyer described her as a `` tough bitch'' in opening arguments. Employees who testified at her trial described her as a capricious, despotic boss. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> told the judge that coverage of the trial had forced her and her husband to hide from the public in their house. Her attorney, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> his client had become a `` lightning rod'' for anti-Semitic hate mail and death threats. `` She has been ridiculed, abused and humiliated in an unprecedented way, having nothing to do with her wrongdoing,'' he said. Two <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> employees also were convicted. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Licari </PERSON> received 30 months in prison, three years' probation and a $ 75,000 fine, and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> received a two-year term, three years' probation and a $ 50,000 fine Her husband also was charged, but prosecutors dropped his case because he was found mentally incompetent.

 Workers at several government nuclear weapons plants face unnecessary risks of radiation contamination, in part because too little is spent on protective measures, according to <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> inspection reports. The problem persists despite greatly increased attention in recent years to health, safety and environmental hazards at the weapons plants. Flaws in worker protection against radiation are a recurring, though little publicized, theme in recently released health and safety reports following inspections of facilities in four states. The inspections by government and private experts, ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> in June, document radiation control problems at the <ORGANIZATION> Pantex </ORGANIZATION> weapons assembly factory near <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; the Y-12 nuclear materials manufacturing plant at <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; the Fernald uranium processing plant near <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and the Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo </LOCATION>. Inspections also were conducted at weapons sites in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, Mercury, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Piketon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, but the results have not yet been publicly released. All 17 major weapons facilities eventually are to undergo such inspections. The <ORGANIZATION> Pantex </ORGANIZATION> report published last week said that while inspectors found no clear and immediate danger to worker safety, the radiation protection program was generally inadequate as evidenced by `` extensive'' violations of federal regulations. The report said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the company that runs <ORGANIZATION> Pantex </ORGANIZATION> under a government contract, <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hanger-Silas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, have been aware of the problem for several years, yet `` little has been achieved to correct it.'' In a memo attached to the <ORGANIZATION> Pantex </ORGANIZATION> report, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the findings indicate workers are not adequately protected from routine and emergency releases of radiation. He ordered immediate action to fix the problems. In late October, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> ordered special action to correct weaknesses in radiation protection at the Y-12 plant at the federal <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> nuclear reservation. The Y-12 inspection team reported a variety of major problems. Among them was a failure of the plant's health physics specialists to routinely check radiation levels in all areas where significant amounts of radiation could be present. The report also said radiation survey results often are poorly documented, and that the plant does not routinely check for flaws in warning devices and other safety features of equipment that generates radiation. For example, such checks are not routinely done on electron-beam welders, which produce radiation fields comparable to, and sometimes higher than, X-ray machines, the report said. The inspectors said no health physics specialists were present to monitor radiation levels when workers removed an air filter from the roof of a building at the Y-12 plant, `` despite the potential for spreading contamination on the roof and also for an unmonitored release of airborne radiation.'' Also, the report said `` safety work permits'' prepared for employees at Y-12 were `` not an effective means of informing workers of the radiological conditions that may be encountered at the job site.'' Significant flaws in radiation protection also were found by inspectors at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, where production lines were closed earlier this year because of pressing environmental problems. Workers at one <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON> building may have unknowingly ingested radioactive uranium metal aerosols because of ventilation defects in an area where workers are not required to wear respirators, the inspection report of last August said. Only limited corrections can be made at <ORGANIZATION> Fernald </ORGANIZATION> because of a lack of money, the report said. Budget problems also prevent a quick correction of deficiencies in training of radiation workers and radiation protection technicians, the report said. Inspectors of the Rocky Flats plant, which makes plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons, cited a variety of radiation contamination problems, including uncertainty about the accuracy of measurements of plutonium particles in the air. They said the measuring equipment is old and prone to breakdowns. Rocky Flats' plutonium operations were shut down last month for a management shakeup. Last year the plant was closed for several months after two employees walked unknowingly into a contaminated area and inhaled radioactive particles.

 Once she was a cigarette girl. Later, she became a queen. Now, <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> is a felon facing the prospect of trading her ermine robes for prison stripes. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> wo n't immediately lose her freedom. She was sentenced to four years in prison, but has appealed her conviction for evading $ 1.2 million in taxes and remains free on bail. She has long since lost the royal aura projected in ads featuring her and promoting her hotels, which described the flagship <ORGANIZATION> Helmsley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> as `` the only palace in the world where the queen stands guard.'' During her trial, Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was revealed as a woman who charged underwear and other purchases to her business; who fiercely and vituperatively berated employees, firing them on a whim; who mocked the law. `` We do n't pay taxes,'' a maid quoted Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> as saying. `` Only the little people pay taxes.'' The trial was open season on <PERSON> Leona </PERSON>. In opening arguments, her own attorney labeled her `` a tough bitch.'' In closing, a prosecutor attacked her `` selfishness, greed and sheer arrogance.'' She was scorned almost universally. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> called her `` the wicked witch.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said she was `` a sick woman.'' <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> was born 69 years ago. Her father was a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> hatmaker. She has had several careers; she was a showroom model and a <LOCATION> Chesterfield </LOCATION> cigarette girl. Later, she became a successful real estate broker. She met real estate titan <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> in 1971. He hired her as a $ 500,000-a-year senior vice president and married her a year later, divorcing his wife of 33 years. <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> had been married before, too. She divorced her lawyer husband in 1959. She had a son by that marriage, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Panzirer </PERSON>; she cried in court when his death in 1982 was mentioned, though she had taken his widow to court to deny her money from her son's estate. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s devotion to her husband and his devotion to her have never been questioned. She calls him `` gorgeous one ... pussycat ... snooky, wooky, dooky.'' For her birthday, he lighted the Empire State Building _ in which he holds a major stake _ red, white and blue. The <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> head a real estate empire valued at $ 5 billion, and their personal wealth is estimated at $ 1 billion. They live lavishly in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; at a duplex atop <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Park Lane Hotel; and at their 28-room mansion, <PERSON> Dunnellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dunnellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was at the center of the allegations against the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 80, originally was charged, but he was found incompetent for trial because of diminished mental capacity. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was convicted of charging to the business millions of dollars spent to renovate the home. For the moment, she can still enjoy the marble dance floor on the roof of a pool enclosure, the $ 130,000 indoor-outdoor sound system, the jade art objects that cost $ 500,000. But the judge decided Tuesday that she would have to leave all that behind. He ordered a four-year prison sentence. She would be eligible for parole after 16 months.

<HEAD>Boy Scouts, PTA Battle Over Screening Scout Leaders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Boy Scouts and the <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION>, two `` apple pie'' groups, ca n't agree on who's responsible for the `` bad apple'' scout leaders who sometimes lead to another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> tradition _ lawsuits. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION>, this fall told its local chapters to stop sponsoring Boy Scout troops and Cub Scout packs, after the national <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Boy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scouts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> failed to agree on responsibility for screening leaders. PTAs in some other states have taken similar action, officials said. Of the 10,000 scout units in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, about 600, mostly Cub Scout packs, are currently sponsored by neighborhood school PTAs, according to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scouts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. PTAs and scout units have co-existed for 50 years, with parents from one group often deeply involved in the other. Scout troops also can be sponsored by other organizations such as church or civic clubs. Concerned about lawsuits stemming from child abuse or other misguidance by scout leaders, the national scouts and <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION> have been struggling to come up with a compromise since last year on new charter application forms written by the Boy Scouts of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The forms place the responsibility for screening, selecting and approving local scout leaders on the sponsors. `` Who can better assess them?'' asked <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sneath </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> publicist for Boy Scouts of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Manya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungar </PERSON> wrote in an October 1988 letter to state and local PTAs, `` this responsibility could result in increased liability to <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION> units, and possibly to their leaders, should some unfortunate situation develop involving the leadership of the local scout organization.'' The two national groups began negotiations in mid-1988 that continued through this year. The Boy Scouts agreed not to change its charter arrangements with the <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION> until July 1, 1989. That deadline passed without a resolution, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION> informed its state chapters that it was leaving the decision about sponsorship to them. `` We have nothing that says they can or can not sponsor Boy Scout troops. That's up to the local units,'' said <PERSON> Tari </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, public relations director for the National PTA. She said a few states have recommended that local units not sign charters. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION> advised its local units not to do so in October 1988, said <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>. `` Our liability insurance put a waiver in so it will not cover any Boy Scout activity.'' `` We know it's a very difficult issue,'' she said. `` My kids were Boy Scouts. It has nothing to do with a very fine organization, the Boy Scouts. It has to do with us accepting responsibility for their leaders.'' She said other youth groups, such as Girl Scouts, recruit and train their own leaders and do not require sponsoring organization to accept responsibility for the leaders. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> PTA president <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, who sent letters to local chapters advising them of the cutoff in September, said she plans to meet with <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> to try to resolve the problem. `` We do have a problem, but we believe it can be worked out,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said recently. But <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, of the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION>, said meetings have been fruitless. `` Really, it's up to Boy Scouts to come back to us if they feel they want to make a change,'' she said. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> notes that the Boy Scouts of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> carries liability insurance for all its registered leaders. But <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION> officials are worried that courts might interpret the new charter forms as putting the onus on their organizations. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said if a school's <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION> wo n't sponsor a scout group, then a group of parents in the neighborhood could get together and sign the charter.

<HEAD>Parliament Approves Law Allowing Prosecution of Alleged Nazi War
Criminals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parliament's decision to allow the government to prosecute alleged Nazi war criminals is expected to result in the trials of at least three aging emigres suspected of the mass murder of Jews. Rabbi <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hier </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, which first brought the issue to the attention of British authorities, issued a statement after Tuesday's vote that said: `` The British Parliament's decision is not an act of vengeance but a victory for justice. It states clearly that crimes against humanity can take no refuge in the passing of time, and keeps faith with the victims of the Holocaust.'' Home Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddington </PERSON> urged the trials, saying, `` It is the instinctive wish of most us to get on with our lives in peace and not to rake over the past. But sometimes one is brought face to face with facts that can not be buried.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> both voted in favor of prosecution, which passed 348-123. In order for the prosecutions to proceed, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> must pass further legislation that would enable naturalized British citizens to be prosecuted for crimes committed abroad. The office of the <ORGANIZATION> Director </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prosecutions </ORGANIZATION> would decide whether individual prosecutions should go ahead. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> have passed similar legislation within the past few years. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigates and deports suspects for trial in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The action in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> followed the publication of a government-commissioned report July 24 saying there is enough evidence to prosecute four suspects, one of whom has since died. It urged further investigation in another 124 cases. The suspects were not identified in the report published after a year-long investigation by two prominent lawyers, including Sir <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hetherington </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s former Director of Public Prosecutions. The inquiry was set up after the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which accused <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> of foot-dragging on the issue, submitted a list of suspects to the government in 1986. Almost all the suspects in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> are from <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. One suspect, <PERSON> Antanas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gecas </PERSON>, 73, a Lithuanian-born mining engineer living in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, has been identified by the British media. He has acknowledged witnessing atrocities while serving in a notorious Lithuanian police battalion. But he says he only watched and is the victim of a Soviet smear campaign. The issue has deeply divided legislators. Opponents argued during Tuesday's debate that prosecutions 45 years after the end of World War II will turn into show trials, rekindling old hatreds with witnesses who are unreliable because of age and bent on revenge. `` Most of the witnesses are either senile, infirm or dead,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, grandson of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s World War II leader. `` This would lead to the establishment of show trials in this country and has no place in British justice.'' Supporters argued passionately that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> should not remain what several called `` a safe haven for monsters.'' `` These are not crimes committed in the heat of battle,'' said legislator Sir <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Braine </PERSON>. `` These are cases of the murder of non-combatants and the slaughter of whole communities of women and children.''

 Three desert motor races have been declared extinct, a victory for environmentalists in the battle to save the desert tortoise. Angry off-roaders said Tuesday their way of life is the real target. The annual Barstow-to-Las Vegas motorcycle race, the <LOCATION> Johnson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley-to-Parker </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, race and SCORE's <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> 400, for all types of off-road vehicles, will be denied operating permits indefinitely, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastey </PERSON>, state diector for the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. `` More ravens kill tortoises than off-road vehicles,'' retorted <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, president of District 37 of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motorcycle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the popular Barstow-to-Vegas run. `` But you ca n't control ravens. It's easier to dictate to people.'' The tortoise was added to the nation's endangered species list as an emergency measure on Aug. 4. Its status will be reviewed next April. `` We've been holding this race for 16 years and we've complied with every regulation of federal, state, county and Indian tribe,'' said <PERSON> Deke </PERSON> <PERSON> Houlgate </PERSON>, a spokesman for SCORE. He said the organization will still stage the race but limit it to <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, owner of a <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha-Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> dealership in <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, said he has ridden motorcycles in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> desert since 1949, and believes many riders wo n't stop because of <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> rulings. `` There are so many people who really love this sort of thing, and they are going to go out and do it anyway,'' he said. The Barstow-to-Las Vegas race was the most popular among off-road enthusiasts and became the most bitterly fought of the three. The race over the years has been battled in court by the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, and other groups that claim it damaged the environment. The race, first run in 1967 with thousands of participants, was put on hold by the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> for seven years in 1975. It was reinstituted under guidelines that limited participants to 1,200. In recent years, the <LOCATION> Bartow-Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> has ended at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> border, although the name remained. More than 1,100 participants rode this year. Some runnings of the Thanksgiving race have seen such activist groups as Earth First! claim responsibility for mismarking courses and laying down tire spikes. <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxfield </PERSON> said there were problems despite controls, including route monitors, marked tortoise burrows and having participants sign a statement of understanding about the endangered status of the tortoises. `` We did find at least two burrows adjacent to the course that were crushed,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> observers claimed they also saw riders leaving designated areas, and widening corridors that should have been narrow passages. `` To this date, not one single tortoise has been injured or killed,'' <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> insisted But as an endangered species, the tortoise's delicate environment also falls under protection. The tortoise's future became critical over the summer, when the animals began dying of a mysterious respiratory ailment. Its survival rate already is threatened by urban sprawl and traditional enemies such as ravens that peck at its young. Motorcyclists say their way of life is being threatened, such as communal gatherings of families at favorite spots for weekends. Ms. <PERSON> Maxfield </PERSON> pointed out Tuesday that about 100 desert races were not affected by Monday's decision. Motorcyclists interviewed said they believed it was only a matter of time. `` Do n't close down the land,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbor </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>. `` Most of it has been used for desert riding for years ... You really ca n't get there by foot, so why not let motorcyclists enjoy it?'' The wear on terrain is precisely the problem, argued <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Elden </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. `` The desert is not there for everyone to destroy,'' he said. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassanyi </PERSON>, race director for SCORE International, sponsor of the Parker 400, called the decision unfair and said it will be challenged. The ruling is bad news for <LOCATION> Barstow </LOCATION>, 100 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Attendance is an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 spectators for the race, in addition to riders and support teams, boosting hotel occupancy to 90 percent of the small desert city's 1,500 hotel rooms.

<HEAD>Increase in Winter Bonuses is Highest in Nine Years</HEAD>
<UNK>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs with average monthly wages.</UNK>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Employees of 291 major Japanese firms got winter bonuses this month averaging $ 4,870, up 7.3 percent from last year and the highest increase in nine years, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employers </ORGANIZATION>' Associations said today. An association official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, attributed the increase to business prosperity in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The official said winter bonuses rose by 21.3 percent from 1988 to an average of $ 4,350 for workers in the steel industry. In shipbuilding, bonuses rose by 15.1 percent to an average $ 4,070 and in the mining industry they climbed 12.8 percent to $ 4,310, he added. Meanwhile, employees of newspaper companies received winter bonuses averaging $ 8,800, up 6.44 percent from a year earlier, the official reported. Bonuses in the information and communications industry averaged $ 5,550, up 5.5 percent, those in the food industry $ 5,470, up 3 percent, and those in the chemical industry $ 5,170, up 6.1 percent, the official said. He said employees of the 291 major firms account for just 5 percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 60 million-member labor force. Japanese companies ordinarily pay bonuses twice a year, in summer and before the new year. The average monthly wage at the 291 firms was $ 1,690, the official said. As of March 1989, the average monthly wage for newspapers was $ 2,440, for information and communications $ 1,805, for the food industry $ 1,790, and for the chemical industry $ 1,750. The average monthly wage for the steel industry was $ 1,740, for shipbuilding $ 1,730 and for the mining industry $ 1,510. For all Japanese workers, as of March, the average wage was $ 1,620 a month, not including bonuses and overtime, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Canadian Destroyer Chases U.S. Scallop Fisherman</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The high-seas chase of a scallop boat is the latest episode in a maritime conflict between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fishermen and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> that has been aggravated by a strike among the Canadian crews who patrol the waters. The destroyer Saguenay fired on the <ORGANIZATION> Concordia </ORGANIZATION> during a 12-hour chase off Cape Cod that began when Canadian authorities allegedly spotted the boat poaching for scallops in Canadian waters. The accounts given Tuesday of the confrontation between Capt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Furey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Concordia </ORGANIZATION> and the Saguenay varied widely. There were no injuries and no charges were filed, though Canadian officials said they were investigating. The episode appeared to be the most serious since 2,200 members of the Canadian fishing patrol went on strike a month ago, leaving their territorial waters vulnerable and posing what <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> authorities say is a temptation for American fishermen. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vessel was spotted five times during several days poaching scallops 2.5 nautical miles over an international fisheries line, said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>, chief of surveillance at the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> and Oceans. The line was set by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> at The Hague in 1984, after a long dispute between the two countries. `` It is not our intent to harass American fishermen,'' <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said from his <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION> office. `` We're not just a bunch of cavalier people who are running around firing at innocent American fishermen.'' The 366-foot <LOCATION> Saguenay </LOCATION> fired about 10 warning shots near the 114-foot <ORGANIZATION> Concordia </ORGANIZATION> during the chase. The two boats collided and each skipper accused the other of ramming his boat. The Canadian destroyer pursued the <ORGANIZATION> Concordia </ORGANIZATION> from 130 miles off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> through international waters until a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter picked the scalloper up early Tuesday at the American 12-mile boundary and escorted it to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Crossman </PERSON>, a special agent with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said officials boarded the scalloper in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, near the scalloper's home port of <LOCATION> Fairhaven </LOCATION>, to confirm the captain's identity and to examine the catch. <PERSON> Crossman </PERSON> said federal charges would be filed against the <ORGANIZATION> Concordia </ORGANIZATION> only if solid evidence was presented by Canadian officials. <PERSON> Furey </PERSON> said his charts never indicated he was in Canadian territory. He also said he and his 10-member crew recharted their course early Monday after a Canadian plane flew by and ordered them not to move until a warship arrived. `` I was n't going to stop the vessel and wait for a warship,'' he said. `` I was fishing, not at war.'' <PERSON> Furey </PERSON>, 31, said the destroyer eventually overtook his boat and, when he refused to stop, rammed it three times. `` If we had been a wooden boat, we'd be cut in half,'' he said. `` The crew hit the deck. I shut off all the boat's lights and kept weaving.'' Naval vessels have been patrolling Canadian waters since crew from the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> and Oceans began a strike for higher wages four weeks ago. <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said the strike had paralyzed much of the government's fishing patrol and left Canadian waters vulnerable to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> poachers, who he alleged have crossed the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> line on `` almost a daily basis. `` It's our firm belief that those fishermen know exactly where the line is,'' <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said. `` It has been there for quite a while now and they've been given ample time to get the necessary charts and chart their course properly out there.''

<HEAD>New York Federal Judge Calls for Legalizing Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The so-called war on drugs is a failure and drugs from cocaine to heroin should be legalized, taxed and dispensed by the state, a federal judge says. In his speech Tuesday evening at the <ORGANIZATION> Cosmopolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweet </PERSON> became the first federal judge to propose publicly that illicit drugs be made legal, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit organization in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that researches alternatives to current drug policy. `` I suggest it is time to abolish the prohibition _ to cease treating indulgence in mind alteration as a crime,'' Sweet said. `` More money, more prisoners, more addicts _ these numbers demonstrate to me our present prohibitive policy has failed, flatly and without serious question.'' Among the other prominent individuals favoring legalization are former Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON>, economist <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and conservative columnist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>. Sweet said proverty caused the drug epidemic, and drug dealing will continue to attract some poor people as long as potential profits are high. `` Perhaps we must ask not what can we do to eliminate drugs, but what can we do to eliminate or at least reduce the level of poverty,'' he said. Sweet, a former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> deputy mayor and prosecutor, and a trial judge in the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> for more than 11 years, said the effort to stem the drug epidemic by jailing more people is not working. He cited a declining commitment to jobs, education, health and housing in the nation at a time when building jails has become a growth industry. The enormous increase of criminal drug trials on the docket forces long delays in civil matters. No juries were available in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s federal court in September for civil trials, he said. Legalizing drugs would identify users, raise revenue for prevention and rehabilitation, and eliminate gangs and drug dealers, Sweet said. `` Obviously, the model is the repeal of Prohibition and the end of <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> and Dutch <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>.'' Sweet said pharmaceutical companies could manufacture the drugs and the state could distribute them to addicts for less than what drug dealers charge, with tax revenue used for research, education and treatment of addiction. Distribution to minors should remain prohibited, Sweet said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has said legalization would create an `` unqualified national disaster'' by creating many more addicts. On Tuesday, drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> compared legalization supporters to advocates of slavery. `` This is not an economic issue. There were arguments made for slavery based on economic considerations,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. `` For someone to sit in a room and make an abstract bloodless economic argument _ when we're looking at 200,000 cocaine babies a year _ is to miss the point,'' he said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> also said he approved of taking custody away from addicted parents in extreme cases. `` Obviously, you give parents _ you give anybody _ the chance to recover, to get better,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said in an interview. `` But supposing the parent is n't getting better, shows no interest in improving, going into treatment, and it's adversely and dramatically affecting the well-being of the child? The state can intervene.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said most states already have legislation that provides for taking children away from addicts who have proven unfit to raise them.

<HEAD>In Critical Condition After Apparent Suicide Attempt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal authorities investigating illegal bingo gambling and public corruption reportedly were closing in on a top state official who was in critical condition today after an apparent suicide attempt. The Nashville Banner quoted unidentified sources Tuesday as saying investigators were focusing on how Secretary of State <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> solicited money for political campaigns from architects, engineers and bingo operators. <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>, 57, was found by his son, <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, on the porch of his home in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, about 30 miles east of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>. Police said <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> apparently shot himself once in the mouth with a .38 - caliber revolver, which was found next to He left no note, and authorities would not say if they had any leads as to his motive. <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> agents were investigating the shooting to make sure no foul play was involved, said Deputy Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carney </PERSON>. Doctors said <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>'s fate depended on how well he reacts to swelling and infection in his brain. Neurosurgeons removed damaged brain tissue and a bullet from his skull during more than four hours of surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The gunshot wound caused `` a lot of bleeding and it destroyed a lot of tissue,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, the hospital's vice chancellor for health affairs. `` It's impossible to know at this time what residual damage there might be,'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. `` The critical period now will be the next several days.'' <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> has not been implicated in any wrongdoing, though part of the investigation has clouded his office. His former chief bingo inspector, W.D. `` Donnie'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, recently began a seven-year sentence at the federal prison in <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>. The charges included extorting payoffs from bingo operators. And <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>'s former assistant, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, resigned in August before giving testimony before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grand jury in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. She was named an unindicted co-conspirator in a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> bingo operation and given immunity from prosecution. She has admitted taking money from a Democratic legislative campaign fund, authorities said. Bingo was outlawed in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> this year after the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the game is a lottery, in violation of the state constitution. Previously, it had been legal for charity fund-raising, but reports showed that bogus charities were set up and money skimmed from some operations. Since January, 22 people have been indicted or pleaded guilty as a result of the investigation. They include state Rep. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, charged with conspiracy, gambling, mail fraud and perjury. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> has said he is innocent. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochelle </PERSON>, a Democrat from <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>'s hometown, called <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> a private person who did n't talk about his problems. But <ORGANIZATION> Rochelle </ORGANIZATION> pointed to the strain of news coverage in connection with the federal investigation. `` I wish these prosecutors would quit letting people hang out there to try to get them to talk if they do n't have enough evidence to convict them,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 It was n't as dramatic as knocking down the Berlin Wall, but it was another sign of the thaw in <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations. This small town has lifted its 6-year-old ban on Russian vodka. `` It took six years, but the city of <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> finally brought the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to its knees,'' joked <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the city attorney. The sanction was removed Tuesday night through a unanimous voice vote by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. It had been issued to protest the 1983 downing of a South Korean jetliner by a Soviet fighter pilot `` It's not a stunt. We take it seriously,'' insisted Councilman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Carls </PERSON>, who is also a high school government teacher. `` It was first outrage over their denial of life to those passengers on the jet and today it's a feeling of pleasure over the extent of democratization over there.'' The council's discussion lasted five minutes and did not end with a libation of vodka or any other beverage. <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>'s only retail liquor store is owned by the city. <PERSON> Carls </PERSON> said other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities with municipal control over liquor sales banned Soviet vodka after <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 007 was shot down, but he was n't able to identify them. The plane was shot down in September 1983 on a flight from <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> after it strayed into Soviet airspace, killing all 269 people aboard. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackland </PERSON>, mayor of this city of 10,000 residents, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would be informed that the vodka ban has been lifted. `` We as a community support the changes being made and hope our relationship continues to improve,'' he said. <PERSON> Jeanette </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON>, a clerk at <ORGANIZATION> Hutchinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liquor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION>, said the ban stirred some discussion in 1983, but was quickly forgotten. `` I do n't even think most of the public was aware of the ban,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 Suspected drug cartel assassins killed a judge, a prosecutor and a bank official, part of a rise in bloodshed as traffickers seek to stop the extraditions of narcotics figures to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The three slain late Tuesday night were the latest victims in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s 3-month-old war between drug smugglers and the government, police said. The traffickers have said they would continue their campaign of bombings and assassinations unless the voters are allowed to decide whether to continue the policy of extraditing drug traffickers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The government of President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> has said it will not let up on its crackdown on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s powerful cocaine cartels. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> was chosen as the site of a drug summit in February that is expected to be attended by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secretary of state for inter-American affairs, told a news conference in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> on Tuesday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had accepted the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> port city, about 680 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, as an acceptable site. Presidents Barco, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> are to attend the summit. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> all receive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid that is tied to the progress of their anti-drug efforts. Ever since <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION> declared an anti-narcotics war after a leading presidential candidate was assassinated on Aug. 18, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has undergone a wave of killings, including a bombing last week that claimed 63 lives. Officials also blame drug barons for the bombing of a Colombian jetliner on a domestic flight Nov. 27 that killed all 107 people aboard. <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Velez </PERSON>, 38, a prosecutor who handled cases against suspected drug traffickers, was one of the three people killed Tuesday, police said Tuesday. He was killed in the town of <LOCATION> Envigado </LOCATION>, six miles from <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, the home of the country's most powerful cocaine cartel. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Henao </PERSON>, 55, an engineer with the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, was killed in <LOCATION> Venecia </LOCATION>, 37 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, police said. Police said both men were killed by suspected assassins working for drug traffickers. Judge <PERSON> Sofia </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Roldaan </PERSON> also was killed by suspected cartel assassins in the port of <LOCATION> Buenaventura </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast, 500 miles south of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, police said. The authorities could not immediately provide details on how the three officials were killed. Earlier this month, a proposed referendum on whether Colombians accused of crimes in other countries should be extradited was attached to legislation that would reform the constitution. The House of Representatives recently approved the legislation with the extradition rider by a vote of 109-to-4, bringing on accusations from the press that the congressmen had been bribed and bullied by drug traffickers. On Tuesday, the legislation was in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> commitee, which was reluctant to introduce it to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. If the legislation is not approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by Friday, when the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns, the bill would die. The 20 committee members were not discussing the bill, and no one wanted to suggest it be voted on, the country's two leading dailies, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION>, reported. Publicly, the committee was acting as if the bill did not exist.

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals panel ruled that <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> is not doing enough to desegregate its schools since the landmark <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> case, but a dissenting judge cited `` substantial integration.'' In the majority opinion, Judges <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> and <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> overturned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' 1987 ruling that <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> schools were not responsible for lingering segregation because the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> did not intend to keep the schools segregated. The three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> released the full decision on the reopened case Tuesday, sending it back to <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>. The original case led to a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in 1954 that set a nationwide precedent for school desegregation and busing cases. But the parents of black schoolchildren sued 10 years ago to have the case reopened. The majority opinion, a reworked version of a 2-1 decision last June, was accompanied by a new dissenting opinion. Today, lawyers for both sides expect to receive the latest ruling. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> and <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> already had overruled <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> in June, but Judge <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldock </PERSON> did n't release his dissent then. The following month, <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> and <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> withdrew their decision without explanation. Lawyers speculated that they wanted a chance to respond to <PERSON> Baldock </PERSON>'s dissent. In 1979, the parents of 17 black schoolchildren sued the district to reopen the <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> case, contending that the district had failed to eliminate all segregation. Among those parents was <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>, who was a student at the time of the 1954 decision and whose maiden name heads the caption of the case. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> ruled in the reopened case that the school system had no intention to maintain segregated schools. But <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> wrote: <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> `` erred by limiting the school district's burden merely to showing that it had non-discriminatory reasons for acting as it did. As 30 years of desegregation law have made clear, the Constitution requires more than ceasing to promote segregation.'' <PERSON> Baldock </PERSON> argued the schools had done enough: `` The school board has demonstrated concern for improving the racial composition in the <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> schools while retaining the neighborhood school concept. `` In some places the two are not compatible, but in this system substantial integration has been achieved.'' <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an attorney for the parents who sought the case's reopening, said lawyers will key on the dissenting opinion `` This is the first time we get to see the dissent,'' he said. `` The school district will be in a position to make a decision.'' The attorney for the school district, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Zima </PERSON>, said the board plans to schedule a meeting early next week to consider it actions. <PERSON> Zima </PERSON> said the school district could ask all 10 judges on the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to hear the case, ask the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to hear the case, or go before <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> to help fashion a solution.

A postal union official said Tuesday the ruling would provide ammunition in the fight against a <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> policy, instituted this year, that screens prospective employees for past drug use. `` We read the decision as impacting the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- current drug testing program,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrus </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We see it as extremely important. We hope to expand its reach nationwide.'' The case focused specifically on a research project begun in 1986 by the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, in which job applicants in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> submitted to drug tests, and the results were compared with the employees' job performance after they were hired. In his ruling, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McNaught </PERSON> said the tests violate constitutional rights against unreasonable searches and seizures because the government has failed to show a compelling reason for testing prospective employees. `` I conclude that the required urinalysis drug testing for all job applicants to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> without individualized suspicion is an unreasonable intrusion into the privacy of applicants and thus, a violation of the Fourth Amendment,'' <PERSON> McNaught </PERSON> said in his decision. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamond </PERSON>, the attorney representing the local <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in the case, said the decision marked the first time a public sector drug-testing program for job applicants had been struck down by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district judge. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>, who follows drug-testing issues for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he was unaware of any other rulings against government drug testing programs for job applicants. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosch </PERSON>, assistant postmaster general for employee relations, said no decision had been made whether to appeal the judge's ruling. But he stressed that the case was limited to the research project in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. According to court documents, job applicants were required to submit to a urinalysis for drug testing starting in September 1986. `` It was done purely for research purposes,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Intrater </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` It had nothing to do with the hiring process.'' If the tests results were positive, the applicants could still be hired, and they would be monitored for absenteeism, discipline problems and other factors. The data collection in the study ended earlier this year, but the results have not yet been published, <PERSON> Intrater </PERSON> said. The program was challenged by the local postal carriers union. <PERSON> McNaught </PERSON> issued his ruling Nov. 21, but the decision was just made public this week.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Drop Charges Against Hazelwood</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Exxon Valdez skipper <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> did not qualify for immunity from prosecution by reporting his ship's grounding and oil spill and must stand trial on criminal charges, a judge ruled. Superior Judge <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON> said Tuesday that all evidence gathered in the investigation except for <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s report will be admissible at his trial for the March 24 grounding of the tanker and the spill of about 11 million gallons of crude oil. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> is to go on trial Jan. 22 for his role in the nation's largest oil spill He is charged with three felony counts of criminal mischief, plus misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment, negligent discharge of oil and operating a vessel while intoxicated. <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON> rejected arguments by <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s attorneys that the seaman, fired by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> right after the disaster, was immune from prosecution because of laws protecting people who report spills. The judge, who heard two weeks of testimony, determined that the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s discovery of the spill would have been delayed only 17 minutes without <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s report. <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON> based that conclusion on the testimony of a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> radar traffic monitor. Even without <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s report, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> would have conducted substantially the same investigation that ensued, <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON> said. Investigators would have arrived at the tanker at about the same time, no matter what the source of the report, he said. <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON>'s ruling appeared to be almost a total victory for prosecutors, who argued that the intent of the immunity provisions was not to protect spillers for incidents that would be discovered anyway. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said he already is working on an appeal of <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON>'s decision. If convicted on all counts, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> faces a maximum sentence of 11 -LCB- years in prison and $ 106,000 in fines. He is the only person the state has charged in the oil spill.

<HEAD>Ex-Bolivian Minister Held Without Bond on Trafficking Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Bolivian colonel who allegedly protected cocaine smugglers and organized death squads with the `` Butcher of <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>'' is being held without bond after being flown to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. A formal bond hearing will be held Dec. 26 for <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, who faces up to 30 years in prison on a 1983 cocaine indictment, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnoff </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> was detained at his ranch near <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, on Sunday and spirited out of his native country on a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> plane. `` Bringing -LRB- <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> -RRB- to trial is a significant strike against the danger posed to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by those who deal in narcotics,'' <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossin </PERSON>, executive assistant to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>, said after the hearing. <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> was <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s interior minister from July 1980 to March 1981 under a military dictatorship supported by the country's major drug traffickers He was known as the `` minister of cocaine.'' He and top aides are accused of setting up a protection racket that charged drug traffickers as much as $ 75,000 every two weeks to look the other way and let cocaine traffic continue. In addition, human rights groups have accused <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> of running death squads that hunted down, tortured and killed hundreds of enemies of the military government he served. <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> reportedly ran the death squads with help from then-fugitive <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON>, the `` Butcher of <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>'' who later was captured and extradited to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and is now serving a life term for `` crimes against humanity.'' In March 1981 <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> was forced out of office. He fled to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in 1982 when civilian rule returned to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, was arrested in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> after the 1983 indictment but later was released on a technicality. At his hearing Tuesday he wore a T-shirt, slacks and sandals, and said only `` I understand,'' as he was read a summary of the charges. He was being represented by <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinon </PERSON>, one of the attorneys who represented Colombian drug kingpin <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, sentenced last year in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> to life in prison. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has applauded <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s role in <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>' capture, a sentiment echoed by federal law enforcement officials here `` It sends a message that they're willing to go after the highest-level traffickers and send them here for trial,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON>, the former top drug prosecutor in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Former Olympic gold medalist <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> says she has a business relationship with the married father of four who helped her escape from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, not a romantic one. `` He's not my lover boy, he's my manager,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> during a telephone interview Tuesday. The 28-year-old gold medalist, who has shared a hotel room with <PERSON> Constantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Panait </PERSON> for the past week, added: `` It is all a big lie and you are very bad. ... -LRB- <PERSON> Panait </PERSON> -RRB- is just trying to help me. We are not lovers. Ask Constantin. He will tell you.'' <PERSON> Panait </PERSON>, 36, also spoke from the couple's room. `` There is no romance,'' he said. `` I am just her manager, only that. I am trying to help her make movies and commercials, and maybe get a book of her life. That's all.'' He and <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> two weeks ago after the 28-year-old gymnast left her homeland with six others Nov. 28. At a news conference last week, <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> and <PERSON> Panait </PERSON> told reporters they would live together in south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. When asked about a romance, <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> blushed. And when a reporter wondered if she knew <PERSON> Panait </PERSON> is married and a father, she answered: `` So what?'' That remark cast <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> in an unfavorable light with much of the public and with some national advertisers, and has been highlighted repeatedly by the media. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> and <PERSON> Panait </PERSON> have stayed at a <LOCATION> Pompano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> hotel since Dec. 5. <PERSON> Panait </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hallandale </LOCATION> roofer, has not returned to the home he shared with his wife, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, 25, and their children, ages 2 to 6. `` I do n't know when I will go back home,'' he said Tuesday. `` But <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> knows all of this. I have called her to explain everything. This is all not true about a romance.'' <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Panait </PERSON>, who has not seen her husband since Nov. 2, seemed surprised and relieved. `` Really? That's good news,'' she said. `` It sure makes me feel a lot better. But, I will believe this about him being her manager when I hear it from him face-to-face when he comes home.''

 Crooner <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> was battling alcoholism and depression when he found out his inheritance had run out, and that pushed him over the edge to suicide, a family spokeswoman said. His body, bearing a gunshot wound to the head, was found Monday at his condominium in <LOCATION> Calabasas </LOCATION> where he was being treated for his drinking problem, said <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiss </PERSON>. An autopsy to officially determine the cause of death was scheduled for today, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dambacher </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coroner. <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, 51, was the youngest of four sons born to <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION>, the legendary singer of `` White Christmas,'' and <PERSON> Dixie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>. The elder <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION>, who also starred with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> in a series of popular `` Road'' pictures, died of a heart attack at age 73 in 1977. Mrs. <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> died of cancer in 1952. <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> married actress <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> in 1957 and they had two boys and a girl. Ms. <PERSON> Reiss </PERSON>, a longtime friend and publicist for <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION> brothers were informed on Nov. 30 that their inheritance was n't making money anymore. It was planned by their mother 45 years ago and was based on investments in crude oil. The inheritance provided a regular income for the brothers, including twins <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON>. `` It was not humongous but it certainly allowed all four boys to live comfortably,'' Ms. <PERSON> Reiss </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> said to me that <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>'s problem is that he is too good and that he is a sweet, kind, gentle guy, and maybe he should have been meaner because maybe he could have taken this blow,'' Ms. <PERSON> Reiss </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> was married three times. His first marriage was to dancer <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Frederickson </PERSON>. He also wed secretary <PERSON> Janey </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> before marrying former Miss Alaska <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON>. His famous father was long known as one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s pre-eminent family men, but <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>'s 1983 book, `` Going My Own Way,'' portrayed the elder <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> as a less-than-perfect parent who was a stern disciplinarian. <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> supported his brother at the time of its publication but had a tempered view of its revelations. `` I never expected affection from my father so it did n't bother me,'' he once told an interviewer.

 Relatives of some of 248 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers killed in an airliner crash in <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> four years ago are joining with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members and Canadian investigators in urging a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inquiry into the disaster. `` Something is obviously wrong and has been obviously wrong for the last four years,'' Rep. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, said at a news conference following ceremonies at <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> marking the crash anniversary. <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON>, victims' relatives and two Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> members who disagreed with a majority conclusion on the crash said they see a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian government coverup in the three-year investigation that concluded the chartered DC-8 Arrow Air jetliner was downed by ice on the wings as it took off from <LOCATION> Gander </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>. A board minority report said there was evidence of a fire and explosion, possibly from a terrorist bomb, before the Dec. 12, 1985, crash which killed the soldiers and eight American crew members. A Canadian judge earlier this year disagreed with both the board majority and minority conclusions but said the inquiry into <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s worst aviation disaster should not be reopened because there was n't enough evidence left to determine the cause. <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON> is trying to get President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and a congressional committee to open inquiries into the crash, which has never been the subject of a formal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigation. <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON> said he has been lied to about the crash by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which participated in the Canadian investigation but issued no conclusions of their own. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said there was no investigation, then they found a 277-page report,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said there was no cargo manifest, then all of the sudden there was one.'' `` There is circumstantial evidence of a coverup,'' <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON> said. He said Canadian authorities appear to have gone along with <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> decisions on what was in `` the national interest.'' <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON> said he was not prepared to say that terrorists were involved but noted that the soldiers had been on a mission to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, that a pro-Iranian group claimed credit for the crash and that it came at a time when it was later determined that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was involved in the Iran-Contra affair, trying to exchange arms for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Dr. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said his organization of victims' families has grown from six members at the first of the year to 130 with renewed interest in the crash. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a pathologist, said examination of the bodies, including that of his son, Sgt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, shows evidence of a fire prior to the crash. He said family members have written to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> complaining about the lack of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigation but he said none has received a reply. In October, 103 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> signed a letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> calling for a presidential inquiry, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has an `` obligation to finish the investigation that was inadequately conducted by the Canadian government.'' <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON> invited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to the memorial service, but the president did not attend. Les Filotas and <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON>, members of the Canadian investigative board, told the news conference they believed an explosion caused the crash _ either from a bomb or explosive souvenirs in the cargo area. <PERSON> Filotas </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers have been known in other instances to smuggle aboard in their luggage weaponry that is not allowed on airliners. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> concluded in June, after its own inquiry, that the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> investigators relied on fabricated and erroneous evidence in reaching their conclusion that the crash was caused by wing ice.

 A former army commando who says he was assigned to spy on anti-apartheid activists in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> has been arrested for desertion, military headquarters said today. The arrest came five days after an anti-apartheid newspaper, Free Weekly, published an interview in which the former soldier, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Carelse </PERSON>, made detailed claims about his activities in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carelse </PERSON> said he was instructed by the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> branch to live in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> and infiltrate militant anti-apartheid groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement and the Committee of South African War Resisters. The <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> has very active anti-apartheid groups, including the main office of the War Resisters. <PERSON> Carelse </PERSON> said he went to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> in July 1988 and returned to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in March. While in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carelse </PERSON> reportedly stayed with his brother-in-law, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Raper </PERSON>, a leader of the draft resisters' committeee. At the time of his arrest, <PERSON> Carelse </PERSON> was enrolled at a technical college in <LOCATION> Johanneburg </LOCATION>. The army statement said only that <PERSON> Carelse </PERSON> had been arrested as a deserter. There has been no official comment on <PERSON> Carelse </PERSON>'s allegations Security officials often boast that they have infilitrated the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> in neighboring <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries and elsewhere in the world. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has offices in about 30 countries, more places than <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has embassies worldwide. Police are investigating the possibility that some members of the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> branch may have had direct or indirect links with death squads alleged to have killed anti-apartheid activists in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> over the past 10 years.

 A reporter who has criticized the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> attorney general's investigation of the 1976 car-bomb murder of journalist <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON> has been slapped with a grand jury subpoena in an attempt to intimidate him, his lawyer says. `` We'll move to quash or limit the subpoena,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodney </PERSON>, a lawyer for reporter <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Devereux </PERSON>, said Tuesday. <PERSON> Devereux </PERSON> was served with a state grand jury subpoena last week by aides to Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>. The subpoena came days after <PERSON> Devereux </PERSON> had published new criticisms of <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>'s efforts to find <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON>' killers. The attorney general and <PERSON> Devereux </PERSON> declined comment, citing a state law that makes it a crime to disclose grand jury matters. But <PERSON> Bodney </PERSON> confirmed that his client had been subpoenaed and added, `` It is <PERSON> Devereux </PERSON>'s judgment that it is harassment and designed to intimidate.'' <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON>, a reporter for The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, died 11 days after a remote-controlled bomb blew up his car 13 years ago. <PERSON> Devereux </PERSON>, a freelance reporter, has published stories in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scottsdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> and in a private newsletter pointing to areas that he says <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>'s office has failed to pursue. The state grand jury does not have jurisdiction over the killing but has been investigating conspiracy and obstruction of justice allegations, according to documents made available to The Associated Press in October. <PERSON> Bodney </PERSON> said the subpoena did not ask <PERSON> Devereux </PERSON> to bring any documents or specify whether he was a potential target or what the grand jury wants to know. `` I think it's improper for the attorney general to conduct a freewheeling examination of a reporter that will inhibit his newsgathering ability perhaps for all time,'' the lawyer said. In addition to the state and federal constitution's free-press guarantees, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s shield law protects reporters from having to disclose their sources, he said. `` Let the grand jury call witnesses with first-hand information and not interrogate reporters about their sources,'' <PERSON> Bodney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>, a Republican, has come under increasing fire over the unsolved slaying. He has not announced whether he will seek re-election next year. He recently asked a judge to reinstate a murder charge against one of the original suspects in a move that <PERSON> Devereux </PERSON> had criticized, days before being subpoenaed, as likely to be unproductive and a possible case of playing politics. Among those known to have been subpoenaed is <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> lawyer who has acknowledged that he arranged for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> to travel to <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havasu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hours after the bombing. <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, a racing-dog breeder, was convicted of planting the bomb. No mastermind was ever convicted, and investigators have not established the motive with any certainty.

<HEAD>Eagles, City Ban Beer in Stands; Skyboxes Still Wet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An outbreak of snowball and ice throwing during a <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION> game has prompted a ban on beer in the stands for the rest of the season, but alcohol will be allowed in the stadium's luxury boxes. `` It may be discriminatory, but it's legal,'' City Solicitor <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurland </PERSON> said Tuesday. The luxury boxes held by corporate bigwigs and other VIPs `` do n't pose the same safety issue that is posed by the people in the stands,'' he said. The outburst _ witnessed by a CBS TV audience Sunday in parts of the country _ resulted in at least six arrests and the ejection of 200 fans. The ban was agreed to by the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION>, the city and a vending company at city-owned Veterans Stadium and applies to the football team's remaining regular-season home game and any playoff games this year. It remains to be decided whether the ban will continue next year as well. The weekend outburst during a game against the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cowboys </ORGANIZATION> embarrassed city and team officials. Snow and ice hit members of the <ORGANIZATION> Cowboys </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION> cheerleaders and fans in the line of fire. A few people were slightly hurt. The Eagles and the city had asked <ORGANIZATION> Ogden-Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a stadium concession, to stop beer sales because they believed alcohol helped cause the outburst. `` It was something that needed to be done,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Ground </PERSON>, general manager for Ogden-Allied. The Eagles also banned alcohol at tailgate parties outside the stadium. Until now, beer had been sold in the first half of games and drinking had been tolerated at one parking lot. The Eagles have one regular-season home game remaining, Dec. 24 against the <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardinals </ORGANIZATION>, but are in position to make the playoffs. Ogden-Allied also handles the food concessions at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superdome </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdome </LOCATION> and Rich Stadium in <LOCATION> Orchard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON> discontinued the sale of alcohol on Monday nights because of fan misbehavior.

 More than 6,000 Vietnamese refugees demonstrated in three detention centers today to protest the forced repatriation of 51 fellow boat people a day earlier, a government spokesman said. A government official of this British colony, meanwhile, said the repatriation program would continue despite international criticism. `` It is our intention to put into place a continuing program to return to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> all those who are judged not to be refugees,'' Chief Secretary Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. His speech did not include a timetable for further repatriation. The approximately 44,000 Vietnamese who have sailed into <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> since June 1988 are considered illegal `` economic'' immigrants unless they can prove the fled their Communist homeland fearing persecution. Nearly 6,800 have been denied refugee status after being screened by immigration officials. A few more than 700 have qualified. The first batch to be sent home against their will were whisked screaming and crying from their detention center by riot police before dawn Tuesday and put on a plane to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has promised the returnees will be treated humanely. The <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> government said today that the boat people fled their homeland because embargoes by non-Communist nations had created economic problems in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and because the refugees had received false hopes of better economic opportunity in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> condemned the forced repatriation. The demonstrations today were `` peaceful and orderly'' as Vietnamese marched around the camps chanting slogans and waving banners protesting involuntary repatriation, said government spokesman <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON>. Local radio quoted some protesters as saying they would rather die in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> than be forced back home. About 3,000 boat people marched in <LOCATION> Hei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chau </LOCATION> detention center, a former leper colony on an outlying island, and another 3,000 protested at <LOCATION> Whitehead </LOCATION> camp in the New Territories. About 300 more demonstrated at Chi Ma Wan center on outlying <LOCATION> Lantau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The longest demonstration lasted two hours and all were over by evening, <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON> said. `` Basically, it was n't very unruly. They just marched around the compound,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government argues that sending the Vietnamese back home is more humane than keeping them indefinitely in the camps, which are overcrowded and rife with violence and malnutrition. But human rights organizations, British opposition politicians and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government have criticized the program. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expressed deep regret over the repatriations and said `` British authorities should continue to grant asylum to all those persons from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> who seek it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> responded to critics by saying that `` those who have been loudest in their condemnation have been slowest in bringing forward practical alternatives. We have returned no one who in the eyes of the international community is a bonafide refugee.'' He added: `` We do not look for the world's applause, but we are entitled, I feel, to the world's understanding.'' <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> maintain that the territory already is swamped with Vietnamese boat people and mandatory repatriation is needed to discourage another influx when the new sailing season begins next year. They claim that most Vietnamese now sailing into <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> are not escaping persecution but only seeking a better life. About 56,000 Vietnamese are housed in the colony's squalid camps. Those who arrived before June 1988 automatically were granted refugee status and are eligible for resettlement.

 The new opposition-dominated government today said it is drafting laws guaranteeing free assembly and association and freedom of religion, while Communists lawmakers debated how to pick a new president. The proposed reforms were announced by Deputy Premier <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON>, a dissident lawyer who was released from jail just two weeks ago and on Sunday was named to the first government in 41 years led by non-Communists. The changes in the penal code would strengthen the independence of the judiciary and reduce the time a person can be held in custody before charges are filed, <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON> said. The presidential tussle is the latest battle for a popular opposition movement that in three weeks got the Communists to oust old Stalinist hard-liners and relinquish the party's 41-year monopoly on power. Under the constitution, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> must elect a president in 14 days. That would be Dec. 23, two weeks after hard-liner <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> was forced to resign to satisfy the opposition. Some Communist lawmakers want the choice to be made by public referendum. But the opposition, hoping to keep its momentum while it can, is pressing for a quicker decision. <PERSON> Vasil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON>, a member of the Communist Politburo, said opposition leaders agreed during negotiations Tuesday that 14 days is n't enough time to choose a president. Many opposition figures favor <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, a playwright and oft-jailed dissident who is the emotional rallying point of the reform movement. After discussions by constitutional lawyers from all parties on Tuesday, <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON> said it might take from 45 days to 60 days for an election to be held, whether in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> or by a vote of the people. <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON> is a senior Communist who negotiated with the opposition the coalition government chosen last week. The Cabinet was the first to make Communists a minority in the government in four decades. <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON> conceded that <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> `` represents something and in no way can we underestimate his position in society.'' `` What we are trying to find is the least complicated agreement,'' he said. He said the Communists were aware that `` If Mr. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was not elected by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, that would also create tensions. That's why we're in negotations.'' But <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, who was being denounced as an isolated, anti-Socialist dissident only a month ago, is apparently difficult for many Communists to accept as president. Central <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> is plastered with posters pushing <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s candidacy, and about 500 demonstrators stood outside <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> shouting support for him Tuesday as deputies entered the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON> said the Communists sought the quick solution to the impasse because `` we are more or less facing a constitutional crisis,'' a reference to the 14-day deadline the constitution mandates. Deputy <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Blazej </PERSON>, speaking on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> deputies who dominate the 350-member parliament, proposed amending the constitution to allow for a presidential referendum within a month. It failed to pass. Civic Forum, the opposition movement <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> has guided through the past three weeks of crisis, strongly rejects a referendum. It said that although the idea seemed `` enticingly democratic,'' it in fact would mean swiftly amending a constitution for the second time in less than three weeks, and could lead to a presidential campaign leaving the country `` more divided than united.'' The government instead should press ahead with free elections, the group said in a statement. Then, a new, freely elected <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> would choose a new president. `` We are not concerned with whether <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> would have a better chance'' in Parliament than in a referendum, said Civic Forum spokesman <PERSON> Lubos </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobrovsky </PERSON>. `` We are concerned with democracy having a better chance.'' Last week, Civic Forum indicated there was virtual agreement with the Communists that the president should be a Czech and non-party member, balancing the Communist premier, <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON>, a Slovak. Traditionally, top posts in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> have been divided between Czechs and Slovaks. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, 68, the leader of the 1968 `` Prague Spring'' reforms that were crushed by a Soviet-led invasion, also is a candidate for president. Others are <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, who resigned as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> premier last week after failing to reach an agreement with the opposition; and <PERSON> Cestmir </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisar </PERSON>, a `` Prague Spring'' leader who like <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1970 but has retained many Socialist ideals. <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, 76, resigned Sunday after swearing in a government containing some dissidents who were jailed because of his policies after the 1968 invasion. Other hard-liners lost their last leadership positions Tuesday, when they resigned from the presidium that guides the Parliament. The 15 deputies who stepped down included ousted Communist party chief <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, who last week also was expelled from party ranks; and <PERSON> Vasil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilak </PERSON>, the Communist held most responsible for the 1968 invasion.

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said today that embargoes by non-Communist nations helped create the economic problems that caused many of its citizens to flee to other countries in search of better economic opportunity. The commentary by the official <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> also reiterated the government's condemnation of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s forcible repatriation on Tuesday of more than 50 Vietnamese refugees. `` The policies of hostility and economic sanctions ... by some countries against <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> over the past 10 years is one of the reasons causing economic difficulties in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. This led to the fact that some people fled the country,'' said the commentary carried by the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> radio and monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> can not ignore its compatriots who nurtured the illusion of looking for a paradise in other countries and have been detained in camps for years,'' it said. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and its colonial ruler, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, flew back home 51 Vietnamese from a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> camp Tuesday in the first forced repatriation. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> considers 44,000 Vietnamese who poured into the territory since June 1988 to be illegal immigrants seeking jobs, not political refugees from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Communist regime. `` <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> always welcomes those who are willing to repatriate and at the same time rejects forced repatriation,'' the commentary said. `` The repatriation from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, including those who returned on Dec. 12, 1989, are part of the framework of that policy.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has been largely isolated from the non-Communist world since <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> overthrew the U.S.-backed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> government in April 1975, triggering the boat exodus. Most non-Communist countries, including <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, imposed or continued embargoes on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> after its troops invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 and installed a pro-Vietnamese government.

 Jailed black nationalist leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, whose release is expected within weeks, met today with President F.W. de Klerk about the prospects for black-white political negotiations. The meeting, announced by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, was <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s second with a South African president this year He met with President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> on July 5, also at <LOCATION> Tuynhuis </LOCATION>, the presidential office in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> had requested the meeting and that <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> `` welcomed the opportunity.'' It said further talks were expected next year. The meeting `` fitted in with Mr. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s program to consult with the full spectrum of political opinion concerning the mutual future of all South Africans,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, leader of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the country's best-known black leader, has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-led government. The far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which won 31 percent of the white vote in September's parliamentary elections, said today's meeting represented a de facto legalization of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> The Conservative's leader, <PERSON> Andries </PERSON> <PERSON> Treurnicht </PERSON>, condemned de Klerk for meeting the leader of `` a banned terrorist organization'' and suggested he had underestimated whites' desire to retain full political sovereignty. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who took office in August, says he wants to end racial discrimination and extend political rights to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 28 million blacks within five years. However, he opposes black majority rule and a one-man, one-vote system. He envisions some type of mechanism that will give whites veto power on major policy decisions. At today's meeting, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> discussed `` ways and means to address current obstacles in the way of meaningful dialogue,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement said. `` Follow-up talks in the new year are envisaged.'' The ministry said no further details about the substance of the talks would be released. Justice Minister <PERSON> Kobie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coetsee </PERSON> and Constitutional Development Minister <PERSON> Gerrit </PERSON> <PERSON> Viljoen </PERSON> attended the meeting, the statement added. All prominent black leaders, even conservative ones, say <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release is a precondition for negotiations with the government. Most black leaders also demand the release of other security prisoners and the lifting of the 3 -LCB- - year-old state of emergency before any talks begin <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 71, is not likely to be released this year, but government sources have been quoted as saying he probably will be freed before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> convenes in early February. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, since succeeding <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, has ushered in several reforms that have eased political tension. He has permitted huge anti-apartheid demonstrations, ordered desgregation of whites-only beaches, and proposed the repeal of the Separate Amenities Act, which permits the segregation of many public facilities. Seven of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> colleagues were freed Oct. 15 in what was seen as a trial run for <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release. There has been no upsurge in unrest related to their release and frequent appearances at anti-government meetings. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is held in a suburban-style staff residence at <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Verster </PERSON> prison farm outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> and has been meeting regularly with a wide range of anti-apartheid activists. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> met Tuesday for two hours with <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders freed two months ago. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, wages a bombing and sabotage campaign in its bid to undermine the government. However, the armed struggle has been largely dormant in recent months.

 The Communist Party today reaffirmed its commitment to traditional socialism and said it will still espouse the principles of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> even as <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> ends one-party rule and embraces democracy. An article in the party daily <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> said the Communists also will continue to resist reunification with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In the detailed proposal for restructuring the party, the Communists called for a course that adheres to `` socialist, anti-fascist, pacifist and all international leftist traditions, especially those of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>.'' The proposal is to be considered at the continuation this weekend of the party's special congress. The session began Friday but suspended its work after naming a new party leader, reformer <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>. Despite the reaffirmation of socialism, the party leadership has been overhauled to remove hard-liners and install reformers in an effort to appease the restive populace, which is demanding democratic change and has thrown its support to the opposition. The party will have to compete for power against a powerful opposition movement in May, when <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> holds what are to be its first free and open elections. The vote is set for May6. Also today, the East German government expanded its cooperation with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with an agreement under which <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> will contribute about $ 540 million for 17 environmental improvement projects in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The agreement was announced in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> by West German Environmental Minister <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Toepfer </PERSON>. East German cities also have been appealing for food aid, for help in preparing free elections and for advice on a range of reforms that have drastically changed municipal operations. At a conference in <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION>, West German municipal authorities reported that they had been overwhelmed with calls for assistance from their East German sister cities. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has offered massive aid to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on condition some capitalist reforms are undertaken. But the Communist-led government has agreed to discuss only those cooperative ventures that fit into the socialist structure of the economy. Communist Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> and other top officials also have repeatedly rejected West German efforts to merge the German states, though they have expressed interest in closer ties that benefit both sides. Meanwhile, the opposition group <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION> has filed a criminal complaint against former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> and the head of the secret police force for allegedly destroying evidence needed in probes of corruption among ousted high party officials. The official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported the accusations made against <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwanitz </PERSON>. The decision to seek charges against the two was made at a New Forum meeting in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> met with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who expressed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the democratic reforms introduced in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Under the rule of ousted leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> often were tense, largely because of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and other barriers to free movement that were enforced with shoot-to-kill orders. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> was held in <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> mapped out <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s future in 1945 after the defeat of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. More than four decades later, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is undergoing its biggest upheaval since its founding in 1949. Two sets of Communist leaders have been ousted since Oct. 18. But the growing demands for German reunification have threatened to split the opposition movement. The Communists are fighting for their political lives just two months after their iron-fisted rule began crumbling. Still, the Communists control most of the top posts, and one of the major opposition forces is urging <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>'s government to resign before Christmas. After meeting with <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> for an hour, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said it was important that reforms in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> move forward `` peacefully and in a stable way'' and that this was the major `` political signal'' of his visit. He spoke outside the Potsdam Hotel after becoming the highest-ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official to visit <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in nearly two decades. The two countries established diplomatic relations in 1974. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was pleased that the Communists and the opposition had agreed on May 6 as the date for free elections. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, 61, said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> saw <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s visit `` without a doubt'' as support for the process of reforms. `` This visit is a political sign that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> follows the developments in -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- with attention,'' <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> said. `` We started a dialogue with each other today.'' <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> said his government believed `` this dialogue would lead to cooperation.'' Later, <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., and Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, D-Neb., according to the official East German news agency

<HEAD>Army General Denies Poison Gas Used in Georgia Demonstration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The army officer in charge of the military investigation into the deaths of 20 Georgian nationalists in April has denied that troops used nerve gas to break up a rally, a newspaper reported today. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasiliev </PERSON> defended the soldiers' actions and said they were provoked by nationalists who pelted them with bottles and stones on April 9 when thousands gathered in the main square of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, the republic's capital. Nineteen people died and at least 300 people were hospitalized when soldiers, many armed with shovels, waded into the crowd to break up the demonstration. Another nationalist was fatally shot the night before for a curfew violation. A civilian commission and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials said two weeks later that an investigation showed that soldiers had used a poisonous, incapacitating gas to disperse the rally. <PERSON> Vasiliev </PERSON> told the daily <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossia </ORGANIZATION>, `` no poisonous gases were used, only special tear gas, substances similar to those used by police in the West.'' He said his investigation showed that 272 names of alleged victims of poison gas released by nationalists were false and many names were repeated `` time and time again.'' <PERSON> Vasiliev </PERSON> said soldiers acted in self-defense when they attacked some demonstrators with shovels, but that none of the victims had died as a result of the attack. `` The majority of the people were killed in the mass commotion when people were horribly pressed together,'' he said. Following the fatal rally, <ORGANIZATION> Georgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Givi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbaridze </PERSON> told reporters that some of the victims had died from gas poisoning. A full report on the incident was expected to made to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies during its current session in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> says the latest Central American accord strips the leftist rebels of any legitimacy and if they do n't disband `` the army will deal with them.'' The five Central American presidents on Tuesday demanded the dismantling of both the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and the U.S.-backed Contras fighting in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The two-day summit in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, was the latest in a series that have raised hopes but failed to bring peace to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It was the first to focus on <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, and it renewed a call earlier this year for the dissolution of the Contras. The joint condemnation of both insurgencies was viewed as a victory for rightist <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> as well as <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, but it was also clouded by skepticism and suspicion. `` I do not trust <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. Neither of the rebel armies was represented at the summit and neither has agreed to be disbanded. `` This continues to be the problem with all Central American accords,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Sancho </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition that opposes <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government in elections set for Feb. 25. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said the five presidents had a position paper from the Salvadoran rebels. `` Two of the presidents laughed. Others read it with dismay,'' he said. `` The impression was that it was too much gall on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, after what they have done, to continue trying to look like <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the success of the accord hinges on the cooperation of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` has the main responsibility for the demobilization of the Contras because they continue financing them and sending them supplies,'' he said in a national radio and television address in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on Tuesday. The summit accord implicitly chides the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> by saying `` nations with interests in the region'' should be more directly involved in the peace process. The presidents also requested increased <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> involvement in the effort to demobilize `` irregular forces.'' The Salvadoran rebels have rejected the summit accord, saying it does nothing to contribute to the possibility of a negotiated solution to the civil war they have waged for more than a decade against a series of U.S.-backed governments. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> can not be demobilized by means of agreements between governments, because it is a legitimate force with popular roots in the whole Salvadoran territory,'' they said in a communique. The summit followed a sharp escalation in the Salvadoran civil war, which has claimed more than 71,000 lives. The rebels launched a huge offensive on Nov. 11 in which more than 1,500 people _ guerrillas, soldiers and civilians _ are estimated to have been killed. The accord calls on the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> to stop fighting and resume peace talks with <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s rightist government. `` With this agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> loses its room to maneuver,'' said <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. `` The presidents are saying to the guerrillas: ` You have no right to continue violent actions.''' If the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> keeps fighting, `` the armed forces of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> will deal with them,'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> told a news conference Tuesday after returning from the summit. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said his government is willing to resume peace talks broken off by the rebels Oct. 31 after the bombing of a union headquarters. But he said the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> must cease hostilities first. The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> had earlier called for a cease-fire with international verification and recognition of territories under their control. `` That position is definitely unacceptable,'' said <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said his delegation insisted on international verification of human rights and again criticized the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> government for the assassination during the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> offensive of six Jesuit academics. The murders have been blamed on the military. Presidents <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and host <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> also signed the summit accord.

<HEAD>Bill Would Grant Aquino Further Emergency Powers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARO CORTES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House of Representatives today approved a bill granting further emergency powers to President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to impose law and order after last week's failed coup attempt. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the passage of a similar bill was blocked, with an opposition senator warning the legislation moved the nation a step closer to dictatorship. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to pass a similar version Thursday. The bill was passed overwhelmingly on second reading in the lower chamber. A final reading will be held Thursday. Lone opposition Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, who once administered martial law under the late <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, denounced the emergency decree as a move toward dictatorship. But former human rights lawyer Sen. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Saguisag </PERSON> defended the move in light of the recent coup attempt. In a speech before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said the emergency powers also could be used to extend the lease on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said today that rebel soldiers who launched the coup attempt Dec. 1 were still capable of staging terror attacks and assassinations, although they surrendered their last stronghold Saturday. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> told a news conference the government will no longer seek <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air cover over <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> territory. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jets flew over rebel-held bases to discourage more bombing runs on the <LOCATION> Malacanang </LOCATION> presidential palace, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help turned the tide in favor of the government on the first day of the mutiny. The Cabinet also was told that the business community is looking for signs the government will move decisively to address the political, social and economic damage wrought by the sixth and bloodiest attempt so far to oust Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> fell for the third consecutive day since trading resumed after the coup attempt. On Dec. 6, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> declared a nationwide state of emergency, but officials said the legislation would give her further powers. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions of the emergency bill grant Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> the power to order the search for weapons and ammunition in private homes without the normal legal constraints. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted against allowing Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to intervene in labor disputes and suspend labor laws which may impede production. A majority of the 23-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted to keep the provision, regarded by critics as a strike ban. Both versions allow Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to take over public utilities, such as privately-owned transportation firms if they violate `` national policy.'' The House bill limits Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s emergency powers to a 90-day period, while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version extends it up to six months.

 Freezing temperatures extended across the Deep South to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> today, and the cold was so bitter in the Plains that <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bell ringers had trouble getting people to pause long enough to donate. `` People do n't want to stop and dig in their pockets for change,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Castor </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Kearney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. On the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, this morning's low temperature was just 26 degrees at Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>. Temperatures in northern <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> fell into the teens. The second snowstorm to hit <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> in five days produced scores of accidents on slippery roads. At least two people died. About 10 inches of snow fell by early today in <LOCATION> Powhatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, just west of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, and the city had up to 6 inches of snow. Many schoolchildren today were enjoying their fourth straight day off. Schools also were closed today in 28 districts in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> after a storm that left up to 7 inches of snow. Most schools around <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, which got 3 to 8 inches, either closed today or opened late, and the federal government allowed employees to report up to two hours late. Snow fell from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, temperatures were expected to remain bitter through the weekend. Polar bears at the <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Doorly </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoo </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, reveled in the cold, swimming in a pool that a pump kept from freezing over. `` They're insane,'' zoo director <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said. `` Never mind the freezing temperatures, they're out there swimming!'' The <ORGANIZATION> Peoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>, a homeless shelter in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> city, reported a rush of people seeking a place to sleep with lows of 5 below zero predicted this morning, and up to 3 inches of snow. In northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, today's low was 21 below zero at <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION>, where the temperature never crept above minus 2 below all day Tuesday. <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, had a low 14 below zero. Devils Lake hit 18 below and <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON> bottomed out at 13 below, with a 17 mph wind creating a wind chill factor of minus 52. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s low was 12 below zero at <LOCATION> Tellston </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> reached minus 1. About 2 inches of snow fell Tuesday evening on <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, in eastern <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, and an inch fell on <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Elizabethton </LOCATION>, four men braved a swift current to pull two people from an overturned truck after it slipped in snow and plunged off a bridge and into a creek. <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> was covered by up to 3 inches of snow that caused dangerous road conditions but no major wrecks or serious injuries, authorities said. `` Significant snows before Christmastime do n't occur frequently in this area,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is our second one and it looks like we're going to get our third this weekend.'' Schools in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, shut down after warnings of snow Tuesday night. But the skies cleared, plunging temperatures into the teens, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, a meteorologist for the weather service in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. `` The big catchword now instead of ` snow' is it's going to be cold,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. Predicting snow in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> is difficult because of the region's location, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietlein </PERSON>, a weather service specialist in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. `` We usually are on the borderline, and so often when we have a freak snow storm that dumps heavy amounts on us, we only have a short notice,'' he said. On Tuesday, temperatures dropped below 20 degrees below zero around the upper <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> and it was briefly colder in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> than in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> due to a warm high pressure mass over <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Tuesday's official low for the Lower 48 states was minus 28 degrees at International Falls, and 13 cities in the central part of the nation hit record lows _ including 5 degrees below zero at <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; 12 degrees in <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; and 8 in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. `` From <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> we have a flow of air straight out of the north from southwest <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.

 Kidnappers today freed a senior <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister's daughter they had held for six days after the government met their demand and released five jailed Moslem militants, officials said. <PERSON> Rubaiya </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, 22, was released two hours after the prisoners went free, thereby ending the first crisis of the 12-day-old government of Prime Minister V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, state-run television reported. The chairman of the militants' organization warned of future kidnappings unless the government `` behaves.'' The television flashed a news bulletin saying `` Rubaiya Sayeed Freed,'' interrupting a cricket match between <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>'s father is Home Minister <PERSON> Mufti </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>. She was kidnapped at gunpoint on Friday in <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>, the summer capital of <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state and a popular tourist resort, and the separatist <ORGANIZATION> Kashmir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility. Militants had threatened to kill Ms. <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, a medical intern, unless their five jailed comrades were freed. The release followed haggling over the site of the swap and the safety of the prisoners. The five were released at an undisclosed site in the city, culminating five days of negotiations between the government and the front, said the police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. About two hours after the militants were released, a dazed Ms. <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON> was dropped at a friend's house and then taken to her home. Later, she was to be flown to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> for a reunion with her family. `` By the grace of the Almighty and the blessings of millions of my countrymen, <PERSON> Rubaiya </PERSON> has a new lease on life,'' a relieved <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON> said after hearing his youngest daughter was safe. `` Our ordeal of anxiety and agony has ended. Their prayers and good wishes have restored our child to us.'' <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, unshaven but smiling and wrapped in a brown shawl, condemned his daughter's captors. `` There is no bravery in attacking a girl. It is cowardly. You do n't need guns and swords to attack a girl,'' he said. `` They have lost the sympathy of the people in the state, in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and the world.'' Among the freed militants was <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheikh </PERSON>, a top leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Kashmir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, police said. Sheikh, who was arrested last month after being wounded in a clash with police, was taken by ambulance from a <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION> hospital to the site and turned over to his organization. The other four were identified as <PERSON> Noor </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalwal </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Altaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhat </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Azad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Javed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zargar </PERSON>, officials said. All had been arrested on suspicion of subversive activities during the past year but no charges had been filed. As news of the swap spread throughout the city, 3,000 people filled the streets, setting off firecrackers, waving <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> flags and shouting anti-India slogans. In <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Amanullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, chairman of the militants' group, said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> had made `` a wise step'' and he hoped the government would adopt `` a similar wise attitude toward the future of <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> and leave <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> honorably instead of waiting until it is shunted out and humiliated by <PERSON> Kashmiri </PERSON> freedom fighters.'' Asked whether the swap would encourage the front to launch a campaign of kidnappings to secure its demands, <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said: `` It depends on how the Indian government behaves ... because they compelled us to take this step.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Kashmir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which wants <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> to either become independent or part of <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, commands a large following in the Moslem-dominated <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>. The front, formed in 1965, has often attacked the government and sponsored successful strikes in <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION>, the only Moslem majority state in the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s request, the government of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> had appealed to the militants not to harm Ms. <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>. Moslems make up 64 percent of the state's 5 million people, but comprise just 11 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people. Hindus account for about 80 percent of the population. <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> is claimed both by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and the two countries have fought three wars over the territory since gaining independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. In a bid to halt the separatism, the new prime minister appointed <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Kashmiri </LOCATION>, as head of a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> committee on <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, where Sikh militants also are demanding an independent homeland. <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON> is the first Moslem to be named <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s home minister, a key post that oversees the country's internal security. The appointment was seen as part of <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s efforts to appease Moslems who have borne the brunt of Hindu-Moslem religious riots that claimed more than 300 lives this fall. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> is a Hindu.

<HEAD>Students' Pedal Copter Certified as Making First Human-Powered Flight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Engineering students who designed a pedal-operated flying machine have been notified that its 6.8 seconds in the air have been certified as the first human-powered helicopter flight, officials said today. `` We are satisfied it was not a jump start, but a bona fide hover that did take place,'' said <PERSON> Malvern </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The aircraft, dubbed <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> by the students at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, hovered about 8 inches off the ground Sunday under the observation of an <ORGANIZATION> NAA </ORGANIZATION> consultant, <LOCATION> Cal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Poly </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> NAA </ORGANIZATION>, the official keeper of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aviation records, certified the feat late Tuesday, <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said. Although school officials at the time said the flight lasted 7.1 seconds, the observer clocked it at 6.8 seconds, the agency said. The record-setting flight wo n't be the end of the school's development of human-powered aircraft `` This will just make them work harder,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` They're already talking about building <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON> IV when they get back from vacation.'' Engineering students built the 97-pound, 100-foot-long <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> out of space-age materials, including carbon graphite. The machine was powered by cyclist <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON>. <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> flew twice before, on Nov. 12 and Nov. 27. The experimental vehicle is the fourth pedal-copter built by <LOCATION> Cal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Poly </LOCATION> students since 1981. When they build <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON> IV, the students will try to lighten their flying machine, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. The ultimate goal is a $ 20,000 prize offered by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> to the first group to fly a human-powered helicopter for one minute and reach a height of at least three meters.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is considering lifting a ban on satellite exports to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, continuing to chip away at sanctions imposed on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> after its violent crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` did not intend to disrupt normal civilian commercial relations'' when he barred military exports to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last spring, and officials are reviewing the sanctions with that in mind, White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today refused to reply during a photo session when asked if he was prepared to lift the ban on satellite transfers. The news from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> brought condemnation from Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., chairman of House Foreign Policy subcommittee on international economic policy and trade He said the idea of lifting the sanction on satellites `` makes no sense whatsoever.'' `` In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where the government has only tightened the screws, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration seems to see no limit on what they ought to try to do to help the Chinese government,'' <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> said. Last weekend, national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> and Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to explore the possibility of resuming relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The trip, an exception to the president's ban on high-level contacts with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, also drew sharp criticism from congressional Democrats. Asked about the trip today during a photo session with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> told a reporter only that it was `` long.'' A third administration official, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> personnel director <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>, joined the duo on the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> trip to make personal contacts for the president, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> confirmed that he went and said he also had accompanied <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1977 and 1982. He said he spoke last weekend with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials there regarding personnel matters but did not elaborate. White House spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>'s main mission was to speak to two Chinese friends of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who served as liaison officer, then the highest-ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, in 1974-75. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> purpose was `` simply to hear their thoughts about the changes going on in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'' since the <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> massacre last spring. One of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Chinese friends is a mid-level government official and the other is a former member of the governent, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. The Hughes Aircraft-manufactured communications satellites fall in the category of items on the government's sensitive munitions list that were automatically included in the suspension, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. `` No decision has been made ... but it is possible,'' those satellites will be freed for delivery, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Two of them are under <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> contract to a joint Australian-Chinese venture and the third are for a British-Chinese consortium in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, he said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will launch the satellites for the Australian firm, <ORGANIZATION> AUSSAT </ORGANIZATION>, and the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> consortium, AsiaSat. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> has been pushing for a waiver and has received indications the administration will make a decision in its favor by the end of the year, said <ORGANIZATION> Australian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> political counselor <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Uren </PERSON>. `` We have made it clear this is important to us. We have a sense the Americans understand,'' he said Tuesday. `` We basically get a positive sense.'' One of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s satellites is to be launched in April and the others in 1991 and 1992, while the British-Chinese one is to go up on a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> launch vehicle in April. Licenses for export had been granted for all three satellites before the sanctions were imposed. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` advised <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> it would consider a request for an exemption from the suspension,'' but there has been no decision, said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> imposed sanctions on June 5 in the wake of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s attack that killed hundreds of Tiananmen Square protesters. The order included a ban on export of weapons and military equipment, satellites and nuclear supplies, as well as suspension of any loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Since then, the administration has allowed export of five <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jetliners, whose guidance system was on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> munitions control list of sensitive technology. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said the government ultimately agreed that the planes' navigation device was for civilian use and could not be removed for military use without being obvious. The administration also has permitted <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> engineers to resume work in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on a $ 500 million program to upgrade Chinese F-8 fighter planes with sophisticated electronics equipment. The White House said no planes were to be delivered, in accordance with the ban on military exports. The administration is looking for signs of change in Chinese repressive policies before normalizing relations, he said. There has been no change in the deferral of $ 957 million in <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> loans and $ 336 million in <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> development <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> loans, said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>.

 Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, spurning the demands of progressives, offered an economic reform plan today that continues the ban on private property and generally maintains central control of the economy. The 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> interrupted the premier's nearly two-hour speech with applause only once. About half the deputies clapped when <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> declared that `` the state is the owner of the means of production.'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> claimed he was offering a radical reform `` for carrying the economy out of a crisis.'' Food and consumer goods are in painfully short supply, and authorities now wonder if they will have enough fuel to heat Soviet apartments through the long winter. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>'s speech displeased progressives who pushed unsuccessfully on Tuesday to have the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> take up legislation to liberalize private property ownership and to consider lifting the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s monopoly on power. Such deputies insist that Communist ideology must be divorced from economic policy if the country is to pull itself out of a grave economic crisis. `` Five years ago, we said it was a choice between five-year plans and perestroika, and unfortunately, it turns out the five-year plan has won,'' said economist and parliamentarian <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunich </PERSON> in the lobby outside the snow-covered <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s Palace of Congresses. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> successfully defeated attempts to address such broad ideological questions and got the agenda he wanted for the 10-day congress that opened Tuesday _ a focus on the government's economic reform program, known as perestroika. But <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>'s speech appeared more conservative than the reform plan unveiled last month by his deputy, <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON>. That plan called for urgent measures to lift state controls on some prices, sell off some unprofitable state enterprises and lay the groundwork for a type of stock market. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> spoke at length about developing a `` socialist market'' economy that the state would control, but he gave few details. He offered no specific proposals on letting market forces dictate prices, which are artifically low because of state subsidies on many goods. Because of consumer fears that easing price controls will result in exorbitant prices, the government will discuss compensation for price increases beginning next year and only afterwards draft the reform, he said. The premier also said the government would begin relying less on centralized planning in a second stage of reform beginning in 1993. But his report appeared to contain nothing to give Soviets an incentive to work efficiently. `` We have to leave free to the market only that part of production that would not lead to unbalancing the economy,'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> rejected demands for private property ownership. He repeated previously announced plans to shift more production from heavy industry to consumer goods and to improve technology. The reforms that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> began when he rose to power in 1985 are now being outpaced by changes in other East bloc nations. In other developments in the region: _ Czechoslovak Communists and leading opposition leaders in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> debated the process and time frame for naming a new president, which is expected to be leading dissident <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> _ <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s overhauled <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said it would adhere to socialist principles despite the pro-democracy reforms advocated by the opposition The party is positioning itself as an alternative to the opposition for free elections that are to be held in May. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, many progressives said the government should, instead of releasing yet another economic report, offer specific legislation that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could immediately take up. They also criticized the ruling Communists for refusing to back the legalization of private property, which many economists consider crucial to ending chronic consumer shortages and industrial inefficiency. `` If we want a free economy, free from unnatural influence, let enterprises be enterprises without any ideological violence over them,'' said one deputy, <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Stankevich </PERSON>. Human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who had called for a two-hour general strike Monday to press for elimination of the Communists' constitutionally guaranteed leading role, urged the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to take up all parts of the Soviet Constitution that inhibit economic reform. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Tuesday dismissed that idea as too general, and cut him off when he tried to elaborate. In a series of key tests on the opening day of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, moves to broaden the debate were shot down. A bid to put the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s constitutional status on the agenda did best. It received 839 votes, but 1,138 deputies voted against it. <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Yevtushenko </PERSON>, one of the country's best-known poets, called the result a `` noble defeat'' because 87 percent of the deputies are <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members.

 The top <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> are resigning after refusing transfers ordered by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> as part of an agency management shakeup. Also affected by a flurry of personnel moves in recent weeks are a onetime assistant to former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the former heads of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, offices, the agency's top official in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and its No. 2 official in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. None of the moves have been announced publicly. But a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> confirmed Tuesday that <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bobo </PERSON> is resigning as head of that office and will be replaced in February by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ming </PERSON>, now the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> manager. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, with 234 workers, is <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s largest field office. <PERSON> Bobo </PERSON> submitted his resignation, effective Feb. 20, after declining <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s offer that he take over the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> office, <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> said. Two <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the current <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> manager, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> he would resign rather than accept a transfer to become head of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, office. Attempts to reach <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> late Tuesday were unsuccessful and the effective date of his resignation could not be determined. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has said he would replace <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> managers he did not believe were performing adequately or did not respond aggressively to his efforts to rid the agency of mismanagement and influence-peddling, the subject of recent congressional hearings focusing largely on <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s tenure. The transfer offers to <PERSON> Bobo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> are examples of <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> using his power to `` send more than adequate signals'' of his displeasure, said one source. The jobs offered to <PERSON> Bobo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> are regarded within <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> as demotions and would have required them to make long-distance moves just before the December holidays. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who under <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> headed an office of international affairs, accepted the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> job after <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> turned it down, the sources said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> had abolished the international affairs office and reassigned <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> to another headquarters job. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> job has been offered to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, currently the No. 2 official in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office but he has not yet indicated whether he will accept, the sources said. The <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> job has yet to be offered, and <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> also is looking for a new manager for its <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> office. St. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosse </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Republican appointed to head that office two years ago after he lost a congressional race, began working at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week after he lost a bid to keep his job. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was unhappy with the management of the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> office, the sources said. The former <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> office manager, <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, has been given a second temporary reassignment after being removed from his post three months ago because of <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s displeasure with the office's operation. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> first dispatched <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, for a 120-day temporary assignment, and now has demoted him three civil service grades and sent him to <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> for a three-month stint as a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> loan officer <PERSON> Bobo </PERSON> was criticized last year in an Office of Government Ethics report that found <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> executives violated conflict of interest rules by raising money from private contractors to pay for a fair housing campaign that was a pet project of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bobo </PERSON> was singled out for raising $ 15,000 from a local <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> to help pay for the campaign. <PERSON> Bobo </PERSON>, 44, came to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> headquarters at the beginning of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and has headed the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> office since 1984. His replacement, <PERSON> Ming </PERSON>, 60, is an attorney who was appointed manager of the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> office in February 1984. That office has been deeply involved in widespread <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> mortgage fraud investigations. Attempts to reach <PERSON> Bobo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ming </PERSON> were unsuccessful. Calls to <PERSON> Bobo </PERSON> were referred to <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> and calls to <PERSON> Ming </PERSON>'s office late Tuesday went unanswered. It was not immediately clear why <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was unhappy with <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>'s performance, although one of the sources said `` there were a lot of political problems down there. Calls to <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>'s office late Tuesday were unanswered.

 A man threatened the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Pop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in the name of a major <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION> figure for disqualifying a mob-connected team from the championships, the league president says. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Pop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, said he was told by the unidentified person to reinstate the team. `` The fact that we all appeared at the national championships this past weekend should reassure everyone that any real threats against us were effectively neutralized,'' <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> said in a statement Tuesday. The threats, which were also made against a staff member, began Nov. 8 and `` several minor physical incidents'' also took place, <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> said. The statement did not elaborate. It did not identity the team or the Mafia figure. Nor did the statement give the nature of the threats or say why the team was disqualified or how it was connected to organized crime. <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> did not immediately return a telephone call this morning. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was notified of the alleged threat. However, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kundts </PERSON> would not confirm nor deny any investigation. <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> said he he did not know of any arrests. Pop Warner football, for boys as young as 8, annually disqualifies about 30 teams from its championships for various reasons, <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> said. All records of teams disqualified in 1989 have been destroyed to protect those not involved, he said.

 <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> today outlined their economic reforms at a meeting with 24 Western nations that are coordinating aid to prevent Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s reforms from being derailed by economic troubles. In separate presentations, Polish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, his Hungarian counterpart, said their countries were creating market-oriented economies. Also, they said, they soon will conclude talks with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> for financial rescue packages that would free extra Western loans and help in easing their huge foreign debts. In return, the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> insists that both countries must adopt sound economic policies. `` One of our most important aims is to shape a healthy ... enterprise structure,'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> told the foreign ministers of the donor nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the 12 <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> countries, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. `` Our top priority is to maintain the country's credit-worthiness and to assure access to normal market financial resources that enable us to fulfill our far-reaching political and economic objectives,'' he added <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON> detailed efforts to `` demonopolize'' the Polish economy `` by opening wider the doors to free enterprise.'' <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> have been at the forefront of the democratic changes reshaping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first non-Communist premier, and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has opened its borders, promised multiparty elections and formally disbanded the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Sources said both East European officials were questioned by several delegations about details of their economic reform programs and the measure of support they have in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. The meeting was the first between Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and his 23 counterparts since President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other world leaders suggested an aid program for <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at a summit meeting in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in July. Japanese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Taro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> said today the talks were `` of great significance.'' `` It is extremely important to remove ... the economic hardships which confront <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and to enhance the smooth implementation of the economic reconstruction and development so that budding reform in the two countries will develop unimpaired and finally bear fruit.'' <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> said his government was prepared to offer $ 150 million to an economic stabilization fund for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as soon as the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> government reaches an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. The European Community was put in charge of coordinating the aid program. The leaders recommended the financial help as a way of encouraging the drive in those East European countries for more open political systems and market-oriented economies. <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> external relations commissioner, urged the donor nations to extend their aid program to other East European nations that are moving toward democracy. <PERSON> Nico </PERSON> <PERSON> Wegter </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` The main purpose -LRB- of today's meeting -RRB- is to give sufficient political momentum to follow up'' the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> summit. Officials say the nations, called the Group of 24, have offered roughly $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion in help, ranging from loans and emergency food shipments to export credit guarantees. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in a speech Tuesday to the <ORGANIZATION> Berlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has authorized almost $ 1 billion in assistance to the two countries. He said that as reforms in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> match those of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, `` we believe the activities of the Group of 24 ... should be expanded to support peaceful change in these countries as well.'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that a letter of intent for a $ 700 million loan agreement with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> could be initialed this week. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has a foreign debt of $ 40 billion. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has a foreign debt of $ 20 billion.

 The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> today decided to ask <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to formally abolish the party's monopoly on power by repealing constitutional clauses guaranteeing party supremacy, state media said. Also today, the party expelled long-time leader <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> along with his son and a close associate, the state <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. The developments, which came on the third day of a key session of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, are in line with new leader <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>'s stated goal of reforming the party and democratizing society. They also are in line with the rapid changes under way elsewhere in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has lost its constitutional guarantee of supremacy, and in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> the party lost its supremacy in elections. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s parliamentary committee planned Thursday to introduce a motion to abolish two constitutional paragraphs One establishes the party as `` the leading force in society and in -LRB- the -RRB- state,'' and the other says the party `` heads the construction of an advanced socialist society.'' The report did not elaborate. <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> offered no details on the ousting of <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, who was replaced as party leader Nov. 10 and removed from the ruling Politburo shortly afterward. Also expelled were <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Milko </PERSON> <PERSON> Balev </PERSON>, a long-time <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> associate, said <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> in its one-line dispatch. Since his removal from power the 78-year-old <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, who led the country for more than 35 years, has come under increasing attacks in the state media for alleged corruption and mismanagement. His son <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON>, said to have enjoyed an opulent lifestyle during his father's tenure, was removed from his job at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s culture department less than two weeks after his father was toppled from his positions as party chief and state president. The Central Committe and Politburo have been purged repeatedly since new party chief <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> took power and embarked on a course of reform similar to that under way in other East bloc countries. Also today <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyulgerov </PERSON>, the head of the official trade unions, resigned from the ruling Politburo. He was seen as a holdover from the <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> regime. In an effort to appease <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s growing pro-democracy movement, <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> has largely revamped the Politburo by bringing in new people more likely to embrace reform. <PERSON> Dyulgerov </PERSON> reportedly said he was resigning as president of the trade unions because they had recently declared their independence from party domination. It was not clear whether he remained on the policy-making Central Committee. Thousands of Bulgarians held a candlelight vigil outside party headquarters Tuesday evening to emphasize their call for political change. Several speakers denounced <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> and accused the old leadership of economic and political blunders. Politburo member <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilov </PERSON> repeated earlier calls for the punishment of <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> and his closest associates, and questioned how the system could allow `` dictators'' to rule so long. <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> had been in power since 1954. <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> proposed Monday that the party relinquish its consitutional monopoly on power and open dialogue with independent groups. He also proposed that free elections be announced by May 1990. Also Tuesday the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Sofia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Georgi </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigorov </PERSON>, likened the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to a sinking ship with a crew `` beheaded'' by decades of hard-line rule. He said the party was `` beheaded in terms of personnel.'' `` Who are the young economists, who are the professionals, who are our ideologists?'' <PERSON> Grigorov </PERSON> asked according to the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION>, which carried excerpts from the closed-door session. `` Maybe we have these young people, but all of them were molded in a similar way,'' he said. `` We put all of them on our ship, which is sinking.'' <PERSON> Boiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimitrov </PERSON>, who replaced <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> as foreign minister last month, suggested that some people in the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> still linked to the <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> government should resign. <PERSON> Evgeni </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexandrov </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member and party spokesman, told a news conference that it was `` more important that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members realize ... that we are living in a different age and elect a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that would act on that -LRB- reform -RRB- policy.'' He said several of the more than 30 speakers who took the floor Tuesday criticized <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>'s rule and `` the administrative bureaucratic system'' that allowed it. Others, he said, supported <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>'s call for dialogue with independent groups.

<HEAD>FAA, NTSB Looking into Rudder Trim Problems Following N.Y. Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than a dozen reports of problems with rudder controls on <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s have been made since a plane skidded off a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> airport runway with such a problem, two federal agencies say. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday they have asked the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to provide data on any reports it has received before or since the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> accident on rudders set in unexpected positions on its 737-300 and 737-400 model jets. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> will use the information to decide whether to order any action, such as a design change or modification, said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said the agency had received at least a dozen reports, two involving foreign airlines, of instances `` where the crew says it discovered the rudder was trimmed in a way that they did n't expect.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has looked into the incidents to try to determine if the cause was related to human factors or a mechanical problem or a combination of both,'' <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said. The inquiries are limited to the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-300 and 737-400 models because they have electrically driven controls. Earlier 737-100 and 737-200 models have manual cranks. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators found that the rudder was improperly set on a <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> jet trying to take off from <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Sept. 20. The 737-400 veered on the runway and the crew aborted takeoff, but the plane skidded into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The plane broke into three pieces and two passengers were killed and 45 injured. The investigations will look into whether a crew member inadvertently activated the rudder switch and examine the cockpit gauge that indicates how the rudder is set, <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planes </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Schleh </PERSON> said the firm is compiling the data for investigators.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the country: Dec. 8 <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leader </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>: <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> appears to have survived another coup attempt, the sixth and most serious one she has endured since taking office four years ago. This time, it took <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention to help her through. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> responded properly. But in the long run, intervention may prove to be the catalyst that finally altered relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be wise to step up plans to move its two important military bases from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>: <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> naval base and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> air base. <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> are the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases on foreign soil and are of strategic importance in the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> region. However, the bases are also becoming increasingly unpopular with Filipinos. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s recent actions will no doubt make the bases even more unpopular in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. ... -LRB- A -RRB- t <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s request, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jets flew air cover for loyalist Philippine forces. The move helped prevent insurgents from continuing their own air strikes and taking over <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighter planes did not fire on rebel troops. But just the fact the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes threatened <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> people enraged many Filipinos. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> responded quickly _ and properly _ to <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s request. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> helped preserve a democratically elected government and, in doing so, also protected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military interests. But <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> had to have been desperate to make such an extreme request.

An Avianca airliner is blown up at the direction of a cocaine cartel. Drug lords are probably behind the car-bombing that shredded national police headquarters and surrounding buildings in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> pledges to keep fighting the cartels. Colombians, having lived under democracy most of this century, resoundingly support the government. The cartels crumble. Unfortunately, the happy ending is wishful thinking. Violence on a grand scale has visited <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> periodically, as in the 1950s, when hundreds of thousands died; it could return. And the cocaine trade enriches <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s economy while prices for coffee, its leading export, have fallen. The lesson is familiar: The best way for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to help <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> fight its drug war is to cut drug demand at home.

 Dec. 8 <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> on the drug summit: -LRB- The -RRB- bomb blast in downtown <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> that killed at least 42 peeple and injured more than 1,000 was a terrible tragedy.

 Dec. 9 The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on auto insurance: A long road through the courts lies ahead, but a ruling ... by the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> insurance commissioner is an overdue stab at the inequities that permeate the auto insurance rate jungle. Under the ruling ... a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> driver's address, gender or marital status no longer can be considered by insurance companies when setting rates. ... There is something intrinsically wrong in assumptions that a single or divorced woman is a less responsible driver than a married woman _ and should pay a higher rate. Or that men are worse than women drivers. Or that a zip code alone makes a driver a higher risk. Blanket rating by gender and marital status is as unconscionable as rating by race. ... While outlawing the so-called `` ZIP code rating,'' -LRB- the ruling -RRB- said insurers can consider population density, traffic density, medical costs and litigation rates when establishing auto rates. That makes sense. Insurers argue all those things are factored into ZIP-code ratings, but it does n't always work out that way. Insurance rate-setting is grossly unfair to too many people. The industry argues it works fairly well for most. -LRB- The -RRB- ruling sends a needed message: That's not good enough.

 Dec. 7 The Bulletin, Bend, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, on the ATV industry: Consumer safety advocates are feigning surprise and outrage at the results of an undercover survey which found that more than half of all-terrain vehicle dealers violate an agreement that they not pitch adult-size machines as being safe for youngsters under the age of 16. The government was asking for this trouble when it announced an ill-considered consent decree with ATV manufacturers in 1988. The agreement required ATV distributors to use their `` best efforts'' to assure that dealers do not sell adult-size ATVs for use by children. ... The decree was based on the flawed assumption that manufacturers could force ATV salesmen to dissuade adults from buying the machines for youngsters. ... The fact is the much-ballyhooed consent decree signed a year ago is an ineffective way to ensure that young people do not end up on full-size ATVs. If the government truly believes these four-wheeled vehicles are inherently dangerous for young people, then it should make it illegal for those under the age of 16 to drive the machines.

 Dec. 7 The Leaf-Chronicle, <LOCATION> Clarksville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, on the congressional pay raise: The nearly 40 percent pay raise that members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted themselves in the waning days of the 1989 session probably wo n't be much of an election issue next year. That's because the chairmen of the Democratic and Republican parties as well as the congressional committee chairmen from each party signed a non-aggression agreement. In part, the bipartisan pact reads: `` The four of us have agreed to issue instructions to our staffs that the vote on HR 3660 -LRB- the pay raise -RRB- is not an appropriate point of criticism in the coming campaigns. Further we will publicly oppose the use of this issue in any campaign in the 1990 cycle.'' In other words, challengers to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat who had hoped to make an issue of their opponents' vote for a pay raise will be strongly urged by their own parties not to do so. This accommodating attitude between the two parties leads one to wonder if the political cynics are n't correct: There no longer are two distinct parties in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. They've been replaced by one large group of incumbents whose primary aims are to keep getting elected and reaping as many benefits as they can from the taxpayers.

 Dec. 11 <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat-Times </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, on helping people get homes: President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to assist the homeless, low-income families and first-time buyers is, in far too many respects, more of the same from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: Throwing money at a perceived problem under the assumption that only government has the solution. Nonetheless, his $ 7 billion Home Ownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere -LRB- HOPE -RRB- makes sufficient nods in the direction of self-help and market concepts to make the plan palatable. One of the program's more farsighted elements could enable millions of renters to become homeowners. About $ 1 billion would be made available for tenants to convert and rehabilitate federally subsidized housing into resident-owned cooperatives. ... The best element of the plan would provide vouchers to low-income families to help them escape from public housing projects and find living quarters more suitable to their needs. Encouraging families with initiatives to solve their own housing problems makes infinitely more sense than condemning them to grim federal projects. ... Clearly, HOPE is not meant as a cure-all for the nation's housing problems But on balance it is a positive step in addressing those problems in ways that encourage inividual and collective enterprise.

 Dec. 8 The Phoenix Gazette on AIDS and civil liberties: It's been said that AIDS is the first politically protected disease in history. There is some truth in that statement. Concern for the civil liberties of AIDS victims is appropriate, but it ought not to be the central issue, nor should it stand in the way of warning people at risk. It is difficult to understand how the spread of the disease can be contained when no one, including those who are infected, knows who is carrying the HIV virus. Some officials admit the problem and encourage voluntary testing to control the spread of the disease. Unfortunately, voluntary testing has limited effectiveness. For example, a study at <ORGANIZATION> Bellevue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> revealed that voluntary hospital screening missed more than 85 percent of pregnant women infected with the deadly virus. The fastest growing population of HIV-infected individuals is I.V. drug users in inner-city minority populations. Perhaps it would be more useful to policy-makers if the recommendations were put in order of priority.

 Dec. 8 Las Cruces -LRB- N.M. -RRB- Sun-News on communism: A poll says half of all Americans think communism has failed and is now on its deathbed. We think that possibly they may be half right. Marxism is generally regarded as a failure. But what we perceive as the evils of the communist system could persist under any number of new names. We should never forget that rivalries among nations spring from deeper causes than ideology. The nations of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have been warring for years over territory and economic advantage. Communism was no more than a radical pipedream when the nations of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> blundered into World War I. National antipathies and rivalries brought that on. And many of the same rivalries and antipathies exist today. It is only human to expect that every favorable development on the international scene means the millennium is being ushered in. But history tells us not to expect it. History tells us that world powers always tend to collide when their interests conflict. We must never lose hope, but we must never expect too much. Complacency, such as that reflected in the poll, could prove to be our worst enemy.

To prevent a weakening of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s defenses, both -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> need to keep three important points in mind. _ Cut troops before anything else, but maintain enough strength to protect American interests. -LRB- For example, cutting the 2.1 million active-duty personnel by 20 percent _ 420,000 troops _ would save about $ 12.5 billion alone in fiscal 1994 -RRB-. ... _ Do n't be in a rush to weaken <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s strategic capability. ... -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> D </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- espite the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s paring of conventional forces, its massive nuclear arsenal remains largely intact. ... -LRB- T -RRB- he <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should avoid excessively deep cuts, because nuclear systems tend to be a relatively cheap form of security. _ Do n't cut research and development.

 Dec. 9 <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on medical research: A study published in the ... Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is being hailed for showing for the first time scientifically that being fit helps women live longer. In addition, the study, on the lives of 10,244 men and 3,120 women, who have been followed for eight to 18 years, was called persuasive confirmation of earlier ones. On review, the figures and conclusions seem unimpressive. Of the 13,444 enrolled for investigation between 1970 and 1981 by epidemiologist <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerobics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, only 283 have so far died. That's a death rate of 21.2 per 1,000. It is not a large enough figure compiled over a long enough time to demonstrate that those `` least fit,'' regardless of how this is defined, are for men at 240 percent greater risk of dying and for women 360 percent than those `` most fit'' in the long run. Agreed that this is true for the sample tested. Nonetheless, it pushes statistics to the limits to say, as does <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskell </PERSON>, `` This is a major study.'' In 20 years it may be but not yet. Dr. <PERSON> Haskell </PERSON>, a cardiologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> and an expert in exercise physiology, acted as a consultant to the <ORGANIZATION> Aerobics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Fads exist in medical research as in other fields. We have an impression that this is true of exercise physiology. Exercising and keeping fit are certainly important, but other things in medicine as well as in our culture and society are even more so.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> said he was never asked to use his influence with regulators _ and would never have agreed to do so _ in his three years as director of a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> savings and loan that has since collapsed. A former federal bank regulator charged last week that government officials delayed closing Silverado Savings and Loan largely because the younger <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was on the board of the Denver-based thrift. But <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who resigned from the board last year, says he was never asked to influence regulators, according to today's <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>. `` Nor would I have if I had been asked,'' he said.

You would have to ask regulators about that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 34, stepped down from <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON>'s board in August 1988, immediately after the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L reported it was $ 200 million in the red and four months before the state of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> took control of it. He told the Chronicle he resigned before his father's acceptance of the Republican presidential nomination to `` avoid any appearance of conflict of interest.'' Neither his father nor his father's advisers pressured him to leave, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Regulators attributed <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON>'s failure to `` substantial dissipation of assets due to alleged violations of laws, rules and regulations.'' The federal bailout of Silverado may cost taxpayers $ 1 billion or more. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is examining the case to determine whether to sue <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON>'s officers and directors. Many analysts, including <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L Commissioner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, attributed <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON>'s collapse to a switch from traditional home mortgages in favor of riskier securities. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, however, disagreed. `` My view is the institution had acquired a portfolio of assets that suffered from a terrible, depressed economy, not just in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, but throughout the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said.

<HEAD>Senior Citizens Find Dead End in Search for Free Turkey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUSKOGEE, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>

 Dozens of senior citizens who heard that free turkeys were available at the county courthouse packed a courtroom waiting for the judge to tell them where to get the free birds. Turkeys, gift certificates and good baskets were to be handed out by a <LOCATION> Boynton </LOCATION> millionaire, they said. But there was no such millionaire in the <LOCATION> Muskogee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> courthouse Tuesday. And there were no free turkeys. `` The court adjourned and all those people looked at him ... and looked at him,'' Judge <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Burris </PERSON>' secretary, who asked not to be identified, said Wednesday. `` He said, ` People you can leave now,' but they wanted to know where to sign up.

Officials are sketchy on how the rumor got started, but it appears to be linked to a bond hearing <PERSON> Burris </PERSON> was conducting for <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Tulsa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> reported that the group had advertised on radio for their supporters to go to the courtroom. Somehow, the message got misconstrued, officials said. `` They announced that if we would be at the courthouse at 2:30 we would receive a free turkey and a food basket,'' <PERSON> Cora </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Burris </PERSON>' secretary said court officials were confused when about 50 senior citizens began milling around the hallways. Temperatures were in the 20s on Tuesday. `` At first I was surprised, and then I got mad,'' Court Clerk <PERSON> Nadina </PERSON> <PERSON> Harnage </PERSON> said. `` I think it was tragic that all these people had to get out in the cold, especially when someone told me they paid $ 5 cab fare.

<HEAD>Children Bring in Baby Pictures in Anti-Porn Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Children recruited into a war on pornography are turning in their bare-bottomed baby pictures, a newspaper said Wednesday. Primary school students confused by the campaign's slogan _ `` Sweep the Yellow'' _ also are coming to school prepared to sweep streets and turning in yellow-covered books from their parents' bookcases, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said `` Yellow'' ususally refers to pornographic material. The `` yellow calamity has spread unchecked and has seriously harmed the spirit of our youth,'' the newspaper said. `` But this reporter feels that this campaign should not involve elementary school students.'' The report said some young pupils, told by teachers to turn in pornographic publications, asked what pornography was and were told it was pictures of people not wearing clothes. Some obediently handed in their own baby pictures. Others brought in copies of Baby Pictorial, a magazine for young people, apparently because it had photos of naked infants. `` The teacher did not know whether to laugh or cry,'' the newspaper said. It said even some teachers were not clear what qualified as pornographic literature and some students searched their homes for any books with a yellow cover. Other pupils, told they were being organized into squads that would take to the streets Sunday to `` Sweep the Yellow,'' prepared themselves for a day of street-cleaning. The official media carried similar reports this fall, citing cases of parents going out and buying pornographic books so their children could meet school quotas. One writer related that booksellers in his town were happy with their good sales of pornographic books and that children exchanged the books and read them with curiosity before handing them in. Other children reportedly were bringing in calendars with pictures of female movie stars or any magazine with a woman's picture on the cover Authorities have confiscated millions of books, magazines and videos since the anti-pornography campaign began in August, destroying some in public burnings. The banned books include works by dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and other critics of the government who have been blamed for the pro-democracy protests _ what the government calls the `` counterrevolutionary rebellion'' _ of this spring. The drive recently has been expanded into a campaign against prostitution, gambling, drugs, abduction and selling of women and children, and profiteering from superstition.

 Petty Officer <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said today his onetime friend and shipmate, <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, did not cause the explosion aboard the USS Iowa that killed 47 sailors. Testifying for the first time since the April 19 blast, <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> told members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on investigations that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s conclusion <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> probably caused the explosion was `` ridiculous.'' `` It's a big coverup, in my opinion,'' <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> did not know he was going to be the gunner's mate the day of the explosion, raising doubts about whether he could have planned the blast, <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said. In addition, the gunpowder had been stored in high heat and the cans were not airtight, creating an explosion hazard, <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> did not cause the explosion. I do not think he committed suicide. I believe the report is very misleading,'' <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said in his opening statement. Earlier in the hearing, a <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> official said he made a mistake in waiting several weeks before entering the inquiry into the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> explosion. `` It was my decision. I made the wrong decision,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on investigations as the panel held its second day of hearings on the battleship blast. Rep. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the panel, questioned why it took the NIS until May 8 before it began its work on the April 19 explosion `` An awful lot of the evidence was thrown overboard by the time you fellows got there on May 8,'' <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON> said, his voice rising in anger. `` There's no question about that,'' Powers responded. In his defense, <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> initially considered the explosion an accident, not a criminal act, and did not believe it was necessary to call in the <LOCATION> NIS </LOCATION>, although the agency did offer to help. Powers also said evidence was lost when sailors flooded gun turret No. 2, where the explosion took place, to put out the fire and later when the cleanup effort took place. `` The crime scene was vastly contaminated, no matter who was going to investigate,'' <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> said. `` It would have been better if you had been there April 20,'' <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON> said. Powers agreed. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, in its Sept. 7 report, concluded that <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, depicted in psychological profiles as a suicidal loner, `` most likely'' caused the blast by inserting some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one of the ship's 16-inch guns. In testimony Tuesday, Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>, who oversaw the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> inquiry, said he was convinced that conclusion would `` stand up in a court of law.'' But <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> added that he can not blame the 24-year-old gunner's mate beyond a shadow of a doubt because <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> and all the witnesses died in the explosion However, Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Froede </PERSON>, the armed forces medical examiner who performed the autopsies on the sailors, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel he has not changed his opinion that the deaths were accidental. `` As of this day, it has not changed,'' <PERSON> Froede </PERSON> said. `` I only would make a change when I had more proof and all the investigations were over.''

<TEXT>
 Federal immigration authorities today levied a record $ 580,000 fine on a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> textile company accused of hiring scores of illegal aliens, including a 12-year-old boy. The administrative fine on <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quilting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Walhalla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, is the largest under the 1986 law that contains criminal and civil penalties for knowingly employing illegal aliens, the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. One <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> official said working conditions for three children `` almost bordered on bondage.'' The agency's announcement came a day after the company and 11 officers and managers were indicted in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, on federal criminal charges related to the hiring of 117 illegal aliens from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. The administrative fine covers the employment of 85 illegal aliens, including a 12-year-old boy, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> said. The fine also covers the company's failure to comply with procedures to verify that more than 400 employees were not illegal aliens, it said. `` This is in defiance of the congressional mandate to prevent illegal aliens form obtaining employment in this country,'' INS Commissioner <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> McNary </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> McNary </PERSON> said the agency's action `` should be a clear sign to those who have any doubts that the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is strongly committed to enforcing the employer sanctions'' in the 1986 law. The criminal charges resulted from a six-month investigation of conditions at the company that included placement of an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> undercover agent as a plant employee, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, director of the agency's district office in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. When <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> agents raided the plant last July 17, they found three Mexican boys, two aged 15 and another 12, working on the plant, <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` It almost bordered on bondage when you look at the age of these people,'' he said. `` They were being paid in cash, there was no documentation.'' The indictment filed Tuesday charged that Piedmont Quilting knowingly hired and recruited illegal aliens for employment, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said Tuesday in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>. Indicted on that charge were company owner <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizhir </PERSON>, 55; his wife, <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizhir </PERSON>, 30, both of <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; and nine other individuals, including several Hispanic legal employees of the plant. Piedmont Quilting's attorney has said the illegal aliens presented the company with false documentation in order to get hired. Federal agents raided the company last July in what was called the biggest crackdown on the employment of illegal aliens outside south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The indictment also includes 117 counts of harboring illegal aliens. Those charges are against the company, its owners and the same individuals named in the first count. Two additional counts charge the company, its owners and plant employees <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarpa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seneca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, with making false statements on quarterly wage reports. Establishing a practice of hiring illegal aliens carries a maximum fine of $ 3,000 per alien plus six months' imprisonment, <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said. The penalty for harboring illegal aliens and for making false statements on quarterly reports is up to five years imprisonment and $ 250,000 in fines per count, he said.

Maj. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Lexington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> took the stand for the defense at the murder trial of <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Worthville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, who was driving a pickup that smashed head-on with the church bus in May 1988. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> is charged with 27 counts of murder as well as drunken driving and other offenses. His attorneys, whose tactic has been to question the bus' safety, said <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> may be called to tell his story. Today, defense attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> if he was aware that the polyurethane foam seat cushions on the bus were hazardous when burned. `` Basically, I know that polyurethane foam is dangerous and will kill you, yes sir,'' <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> replied. Under cross examination by Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> said the polyurethane cushions are commonly found in vehicles and hotel furniture. <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> asked if the seat of fire trucks contain that material. `` Probably the same thing we're talking about here,'' <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> said. In testimony Tuesday, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sober </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> fire safety engineer, said that many of the 24 youngsters and three adults killed in the fiery bus crash could have survived if the seats were fire resistant. Also on the witness stand Tuesday, the 13th day of testimony, was former <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Vice President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Feaheny </PERSON>, who said existing technology could have prevented the fire Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Satterwhite </PERSON> did not permit <PERSON> Feaheny </PERSON> to provide details about technology he said might have prevented the fire. But <PERSON> Feaheny </PERSON> told reporters during a recess that a plastic gas tank on the <ORGANIZATION> Radcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> church </ORGANIZATION> bus would have prevented the fire and saved the lives of many of those who died. He handed out copies of reports he provided to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> during a 1988 hearing about the crash. `` What you see in these reports is the technology has existed for over 10 years that could have prevented this tragedy even in an accident of this sort,'' <PERSON> Feaheny </PERSON> said. `` And <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has suppressed that technology and continues to do so to this date in a rather giant cover-up.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> rejected the claim and said <PERSON> Feaheny </PERSON>, fired by the company in 1983 and since involved in a failed lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> executives, had an ax to grind. `` The suggestion that a plastic fuel tank would have prevented the <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION> tragedy is gross speculation at best,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jelinek </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` Mr. <PERSON> Feaheny </PERSON>'s assertion that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has suppressed plastic fuel tank technology is obviously contrary to the facts.'' In his cross-examination, prosecutor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> sought to show that <PERSON> Feaheny </PERSON> lacked direct experience with <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> buses. <PERSON> Feaheny </PERSON> insisted he was qualified to discuss the issue based on 30 years in the automotive industry. Sober, a fire safety expert, testified that the seat cushions were made of flexible polyurethane foam, and seat coverings of polychlorinated vinyl. `` Flexible polyurethane foam is the single largest class of fuels involved with fatal fires,'' he said. When burned, the untreated foam emits hydrogen cyanide gas and the plastic emits hydrogen chloride gas, he said. Both can be fatal after a typical bus seat burns for just a few minutes, he said. Foam treated with fire retardant was `` readily available'' to the automotive industry when the school bus was manufactured in 1977, he said, and seats treated with fire retardant would have saved lives in the crash.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified today `` I do n't know for a fact'' that former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> tore up a politically embarrassing policy statement that depicted the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> initiative as a straight arms-for-hostages deal. <PERSON> North </PERSON> said his memory of the event was colored by the fact that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> acknowledged in congressional testimony in 1987 that he had destroyed the presidential document, known as a `` finding,'' on Nov. 20, 1986 amid public scrutiny of the administration's arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The former national security council aide testified at a pre-trial hearing where <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckler </PERSON>, tried to demonstrate that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was tainted by <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s immunized testimony to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and therefore should not testify as a government witness. Under a 1972 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, the government may make no use of a defendant's testimony compelled under a limited grant of immunity. That includes testimony given by other witnesses who may have been influenced by the immunized statements. The presidential finding `` could have been any sheet of paper but for the fact that'' <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> `` confirmed it'' in his immunized congressional testimony, <PERSON> North </PERSON> told <PERSON> Beckler </PERSON>. `` I do n't know for a fact ... that the document destroyed that morning was the finding,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said later when questioned by Iran-Contra prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromwich </PERSON>. North testified at his own trial last April that he watched <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> rip up the document as then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> began focusing on a November 1985 CIA-assisted shipment of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Today, however, <PERSON> North </PERSON> said that he had n't actually read the document at the time <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> destroyed it. The destruction of the finding relates to four of the criminal charges against <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, who is accused of falsely telling <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he did n't learn of the missile shipment to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> until January 1986. The finding, signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in December 1985, was drafted because of the CIA-assisted shipment the previous month. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 22 on charges of conspiracy, two counts of obstructing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and two counts of making false statements in the Iran-Contra scandal. On Tuesday, <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he was unable to remember details of meetings with his ex-boss, even though the now-convicted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> aide testified about those meetings at his own trial. `` It's difficult to get answers out of this witness,'' declared <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, who said he would give prosecutors the `` widest latitude'' in interrogating North. Questioned for five hours Tuesday by Iran-Contra prosecutor <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> repeatedly was shown transcripts of the testimony he gave last April in which he referred to contacts with <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. <PERSON> North </PERSON> refused to say that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> had directed him to give false statements when <PERSON> North </PERSON> denied to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members that he had been assisting the Contras. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> felt as I did, that -LRB- he hoped -RRB- the right questions'' would n't `` come up'' so that false answers would n't have to be given, <PERSON> North </PERSON> said in connection with the Aug. 6, 1986 meeting in the White House Situation Room North testified at his own trial that he felt like a `` pawn'' in a chess game played by `` giants'' when, after a discussion with <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, he made the statements to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee. But <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified Tuesday that `` no one told me to'' make the false statements. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> suggested that the `` giants'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> referred to were President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, former national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. `` That is not what I said,'' retorted North. `` In general terms I would say it was the executive and legislative branches of government'' and included Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>.

 More than 6,000 Vietnamese held in detention centers Wednesday carried banners and chanted slogans denouncing the involuntary return of 51 other boat people to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, a government spokesman said. Some shouted they would rather die than return to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, local radio and television stations reported. About 3,000 Vietnamese marched around the camp at the outlying <PERSON> Hei </PERSON> <PERSON> Ling </PERSON> <PERSON> Chau </PERSON> island, a former leper colony, and another 3,000 demonstrated at <LOCATION> Whitehead </LOCATION> camp in the New Territories. About 300 staged a protest at the Chi Ma Wan center on the offshore <LOCATION> Lantau </LOCATION> island. The demonstrations were peaceful and none lasted more than two hours, government spokesman <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s chief secretary, Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, defended the involuntary repatriation of Vietnamese, saying the program will continue despite international criticism. `` It is our intention to put into place a continuing program to return to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> all those who are judged not to be refugees,'' Chief Secretary Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. His speech did not include a timetable for further repatriation. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maude </PERSON> said it could take as long as two years to return all the Vietnamese, classified as illegal immigrants. He said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> could not delay just because it makes other countries uncomfortable. `` It's all very well for others to say to us, ` Ca n't you delay a little bit longer?' but that plea has been made to us before,'' <PERSON> Maude </PERSON> told a parliamentary committee. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, in a commentary monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, partly blamed economic embargos imposed by non-Communist nations for causing its citizens to flee. `` The policy of hostility and economic sanctions ... by some countries against <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> over the past 10 years are one of the reasons causing economic difficulties in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' it said. `` This led to the fact that some people fled the country.'' About 44,000 Vietnamese who have sailed into <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> since June 1988 are considered illegal immigrants unless they can prove they fled their Communist homeland out of fear of persecution. Nearly 6,800 have been denied refugee status after being screened by immigration officials, compared with slightly more than 700 who qualified. The first batch to be sent home against their will were whisked screaming and crying from their detention center by riot police before dawn Tuesday and put on a plane to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has promised the returnees will be treated humanely and not punished, the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government says. It argues that returning the Vietnamese home is more humane than keeping them indefinitely in the camps, which are overcrowded and rife with violence and malnutrition. But human rights organizations, British opposition politicians and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government have criticized the program. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expressed deep regret over the repatriations and said, `` British authorities should continue to grant asylum to all those persons from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> who seek it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> responded that `` those who have been loudest in their condemnation have been slowest in bringing forward practical alternatives. We have returned no one who in the eyes of the international community is a bona fide refugee.'' He added: `` We do not look for the world's applause, but we are entitled, I feel, to the world's understanding.'' About 56,000 Vietnamese are housed in squalid camps. Those who arrived before June 1988 automatically were granted refugee status and are eligible for resettlement. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which will assume control of the British colony in 1997, has said it would like <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to resolve the Vietnamese refugee issue before then.

 A magistrate today dismissed charges <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> illegally waved a gun at a woman who kicked in her car window and pulled the beauty queen's hair during a scuffle. `` I do n't think it's unreasonable for a person to reach for a weapon when she's being threatened,'' <PERSON> Magistrice </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said in dismissing the charge of brandishing a weapon, which carries up to six months in jail and a fine of $ 200. <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON>, 23, of Fairmont, had filed the complaint against <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON>, 21, after the Nov. 7 scuffle on a downtown street. <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> said the fight began when <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> ran her car off the road. <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON>, during a hearing today, admitted reaching through the sunroof of <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON>'s car, pulling her hair and screaming at her. <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> said she backed off and kicked out the window after <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> pulled a gun. <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> admitted that <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> has been dating a former boyfriend of hers but said that she had stopped dating him three years ago and that he did not figure into the fight. A hearing was scheduled for later today on <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON>'s complaint against <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> on battery and destruction of property charges. The beauty queen came under fire remarks deemed racist by some people earlier this year upon her return from the Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> pageant, at which she failed to make the top 10. `` If it's political, it's not my fault,'' she said. `` If you look at the to 10, it's quite obvious. It was one black, one Korean, one Japanese, one hearing impaired, one kidney transplant, and of course <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> were part of the top 10.

<HEAD>Earthquake, Berlin Wall Top News Interest</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For release at 6:30 p.m. EST; time set by source</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The disastrous <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake and the crumbling of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall were the recent news stories that loomed largest for Americans, a poll shows. Nearly three-quarters of people surveyed said they `` followed closely'' the stories about the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> tremor, according to the Times Mirror News Interest Index. The tumult surrounding the opening up of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was watched intently by half of those interviewed, the survey found. On the other hand, Americans showed little interest in stories about the resumption of hostilities in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and state and local election coverage. Only 13 percent said they closely followed those stories. The index was based on a telephone survey of 1,230 adults taken between Nov. 9-12. The estimated margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. Only the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger _ closely watched by 80 percent of those surveyed _ attracted more attention than the earthquake, officials said. The survey has been taken regularly over the last four years. Despite the fact that the quake interrupted the World Series, the survey found weak overall interest in that event, with 23 percent saying they followed the story.

<TEXT>
 Recent assessments from rural residences and condominiums have raised damage estimates for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> from Hurricane Hugo to $ 5.9 billion. The increased estimate is up from the $ 4 billion preliminary estimate reached in November by the state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. The new report, compiled by the same office, listed damage to homes at nearly $ 3 billion as of Dec. 6. Damage in the budget board's report, reflecting assessments through Oct. 27, listed residential damage at only $ 539 million. Damage estimates of the agriculture industry, which includes timber, remained unchanged at $ 1.4 billion. The agriculture industry is `` one of the hardest areas we're going to have to get back on its feet,'' Gov <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said Tuesday during a meeting in which the report was released. The latest assessment was based on additional information from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and county assessors and damage figures from condominum complexes, the report said. The new estimate also includes $ 700 million in damage reported by commercial and industrial enterprises that may have included operating losses, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> of the Division of Research and Statistics. The report also listed the following damage estimates: $ 250 million for the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>; $ 200 million for public and private utilities; $ 150 million for government facilities; $ 125 million for automobiles; $ 50 million for <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, and $ 13 million for the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. Insurance companies, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and state agencies have already issued $ 2.1 billion in aid to hurricane victims, <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said. The report was issued to the <ORGANIZATION> Hugo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, an eight-member panel appointed by <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> to assess the economic impact of the hurricane and its effect on agriculture, tourism, forestry, education and the infrastructure. The commission is charged with recommending initiatives to stimulate economic development and enhance industrial recruitment and expansion in the wake of the storm. A report is due by early March. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> killed 29 people in the state when it slammed into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on Sept. 21.

 State officials touring a site under consideration for a radioactive waste dump had to be escorted two miles on foot today after demonstrators formed a human chain to pen them in their cars, a protest leader said. Members of Citizens Against Radioactive Dumping also rushed cars, trucks and tractors to block roads leading to the site after field teams from the <ORGANIZATION> Low-Level </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radioactive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Siting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and several sheriff's deputies arrived, said <PERSON> Taffy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rook </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the protest group. Sheriff <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> called off the tour and preliminary testing about 11 a.m. because of the demonstrations, said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Gebhardt </PERSON>, co-chairman of the protest group. About 150 anti-dump protesters clustered around the commission's two cars, preventing them from leaving the site, <PERSON> Gebhardt </PERSON> said After 30 minutes, one group of state workers abandoned their car and were escorted off the site by deputies who said they would come back for the others, he said. The wooded area is in a dairy region about 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>. Protesters also had staked out a second site under consideration near <LOCATION> Taylor </LOCATION> in case teams went there. A dispatcher for the Sheriff's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said no one was available to comment because most personnel were at the site. Protesters had also camped out overnight at three potential dump sites in <LOCATION> Allegany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, preparing to block state officials from beginning inspections and tests on land there. Authorities said state officials were not in the county this morning. `` I hope that people do n't go outside the law,'' commission spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baranski </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` The courts have made it clear that the commission has the right and responsibility to do this.'' Anti-dump groups in <LOCATION> Allegany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cortland </LOCATION> counties have vowed to prevent the testing at the proposed dump sites, saying their protests would be nonviolent but that they expected arrests. `` There will be civil disobedience,'' said <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Allegany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nonviolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` Whatever they try to do we're going to be out there to stop them from doing it.'' The five sites were chosen by the commission in September. Under federal law, states must have a place to store low-level radioactive waste by 1993. The commission plans to complete soil testing and other evaluations by spring. It will then narrow down the number of sites to two or three for more comprehensive tests.

 People with AIDS can use their computer terminals to learn about the latest treatments for their illness or chat with others who have the disease, under a federally funded program developed here. Patients also can ask nurses about condoms and other health topics anonymously and use a computer databank to help them make decisions on insurance, housing, transportation and other matters, the program's developer said Tuesday. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, an associate professor of nursing and systems engineering at <ORGANIZATION> Case </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said she knew of no other project of its type in the country. The program is funded by a $ 600,000 three-year grant from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not so much how to take care of their illness as how to deal with day-to-day living ... how to get a bus schedule, how to prepare snacks. It also guides someone through decision-making, such as where to live or whether to take a new drug,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. The experimental system is linked to a databank and transmission system called <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free-Net </ORGANIZATION>, a free, community-access network. More specialized information on acquired immune deficiency syndrome is on an electronic bulletin board of AIDS data and information-sharing, accessible only to the AIDS patients, Ms. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. Users may remain anonymous, she said. Twenty AIDS patients selected under the project have used the service in the past year, Ms. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. The program is entering its second phase, which will involve 50 AIDS patients and compare the effectiveness of the computer system with the more conventional use of the telephone, Ms. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. The AIDS computer system is not commercially available, but Ms. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said she hopes it will be `` a springboard.'' The decision-making aspect is one of the system's unique features, Ms. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. It lists a series of questions and considerations to help a person decide how to travel, whether to buy a car or where to live. Ms. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said she is especially interested in patients' use of the system to `` talk'' to one another via computer. `` One of the biggest problems is fatigue, even with people who are n't physically very ill,'' she said. `` We have people who may have enough energy to get to work but they're exhausted the rest of the evening. So the network allows them to make social contacts at their own pace.'' AIDS is a disease that attacks the human immune systems, leaving victims vulnerable to a variety of diseases and tumors. It is spread chiefly through sexual contact and sharing hypodermic needles for drug use. Ms. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said there were about 1,600 AIDS cases in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> as of Dec. 4, with 409 cases in <LOCATION> Cuyahoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>.

 A paramedic says he was fired for arranging to give away teddy bears to children being taken to the hospital, but an ambulance service spokesman said today the firing was related to job performance, not stuffed animals.

 A prosecutor says a two-year prison sentence was appropriate for a man who slapped his 4-year-old son for sniffing gasoline to get high. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vardaman </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> pleaded guilty to battery and was sentenceed last week by Judge <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Tedder </PERSON>. `` It was a serious case of child abuse,'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Raff </PERSON> said Monday. `` It was not normal discipline. I think the proof justified the sentence. The message is clear _ child abuse would not be tolerated.'' Defense attorney <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said the sentence was too harsh but that his client probably wo n't appeal it. <PERSON> Vardaman </PERSON> caught his son and another boy sniffing gas from a can near their home in May and paddled both boys, <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said. But twice the next day, <PERSON> Vardaman </PERSON> found his son sniffing gas, the defense attorney said. `` He slapped him once on each side of the face that time,'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vardaman </PERSON> and his wife took the child to a hospital because the boy was `` acting drunk,'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said. The boy seemed normal by the time they reached the hospital, but the emergency room nurse and a doctor noticed the bruises on his face and contacted police. Photos of the boy taken at the hospital were shown to the judge. `` They looked pretty bad,'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said. `` The child has a ruddy complexion and his face was puffy in the picture.'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said a representative from the state <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> testified that it was an isolated case of abuse.

 The crew of the nuclear submarine <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> successfully launched a Trident 2 missile Wednesday after the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warned <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> anti-nuclear protesters to stay out of the safety zone, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. The launch was the second straight successful undersea test-firing of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s newest and deadliest nuclear weapon, keeping it on track for operational deployment next March. Two of the first three submarine tests failed explosively. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> was cruising submerged in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> about 50 miles offshore when the 44-foot, $ 26.5 million missile burst out of a launch tube, broke the surface, ignited and hurled a dummy warhead package to an undisclosed ocean target several thousand miles away. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> reported several minutes after the 9:15 a.m. launch that the test was successful. `` Another great day for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Vice Admiral <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> submarine fleet. A 60-foot <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> ketch, the Mondeivitano, briefly penetrated the launch safety zone but withdrew after a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship warned it to move away. As a precaution, six <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutters patroled the perimeter of the 5,000-yard safety area around the submarine. `` They observed the range safety warning,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonntag </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` We made our point that we have a right to protest in international waters,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON>. `` We will now take our fight to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to have this missile system canceled. The world can no longer afford the waste of precious resources on weapons of mass destruction like the Trident 2.'' <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> protesters tried to halt a Trident 2 launch Dec. 4 by sending the 190-foot vessel <ORGANIZATION> MV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, with 25 aboard, into the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s safety zone. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship intercepted the intruding vessel and damaged it by repeatedly bumping it and using fire hoses to pour water down the smokestacks, stopping the engines. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sailors in swift boats corraled two <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> high-speed rafts that tried to approach the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, cut their fuel lines and towed them out of the safety zone. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> had halted a Trident 2 test with the same tactics in July. A motor nozzle system, blamed for the two failures of the Trident 2, has been redesigned and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is accelerating the test schedule, aiming to have the Trident ready for patrols by March. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> will be the first of 24 subs to go to sea, each with 24 of the weapons. The Trident 2 is capable of hurling as many as 12 nuclear warheads to individual targets more than 4,600 miles away.

 Six people were recovering today from transplant surgery after doctors gave them seven organs from the same donor. `` This is the first we've ever done with the two lungs, heart, liver, kidneys and pancreas,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuslis </PERSON>, clinical director of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Donor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, which coordinates organ recovery for five northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> transplant centers. The donor's identity and cause of death were not released to protect the grieving family. Storms of publicity surrounding successful transplants tend to discourage family members from authorizing organ donations, <PERSON> Kuslis </PERSON> said. The extraordinary donation was possible in part because the donor was in good health, she said. Four of the recipients were listed in serious but stable condition at <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> Presbyterian Medical Center. The two others were reported in critical but stable condition at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Although donations of three and even four organs are not unusual, fewer than 1 percent of organ donations nationwide have involved seven organs given to different people, said <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharing </ORGANIZATION>, which administers organ procurement nationally. Record keeping began Oct. 1, 1987, she said. `` For all the organs to be viable and that every one had a match, that's terrific,'' said <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>. Factors that determine matches include blood and tissue types, organ size, distances between donor and possible recipient and the medical conditions of patients, <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said. Hearts and lungs must be recovered and transplanted within about four hours, experts said. Kidneys can last up to 72 hours and must be offered nationally in an effort to find the best genetic match, but recipients were also found locally. At <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION>, one of the donor's lungs helped a woman who had been awaiting a transplant for a year; the other lung went to a woman who had spent five years with a lethal lung disease. The donor's heart went to a 60-year-old <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> man suffering from terminal cardiac disease, and one of his kidneys aided a 35-year-old man with end-stage renal disease, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> Presbyterian spokeswoman <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. His other kidney and his pancreas went to a 34-year-old <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> woman with diabetes and renal failure, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. The liver went to a 38-year-old woman from <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, whose own liver had failed, she said.

 The 700 secret police who were designated to read other people's mail have been reassigned, and telephone tapping has been virtually banned, the Solidarity-led government announced Wednesday. The mail-reading unit was closed and its positions are among 1,800 in the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> that were most recently transferred to the regular police force, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Malgorzata </PERSON> <PERSON> Niezabitowska </PERSON>. The police counterintelligence unit also has been cut, by 150 jobs, to a `` necessary minimum,'' she said. Previous cuts to the secret police force, including elimination of the department that monitored churches and religious organizations, freed up 7,000 jobs for crime fighting, she said. New regulations ban installing bugging devices except `` in extraordinary circumstances, every time with the approval of the Interior Minister,'' Ms. <PERSON> Niezabitowska </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` You are not on this list, unless you work for an intelligence service,'' she told her audience of foreign correspondents. The 8,800 <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> positions were transferred to the police forces, but there are still 12,000 vacancies in the regular police, the spokeswoman said. The dismantling of the secret police and shifting resources to the regular police force for crime-fighting were key priorities of the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> still is run by a Communist, Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczek </PERSON>, but he has cooperated in the change of priorities and announced the disbanding of the <ORGANIZATION> ZOMO </ORGANIZATION> riot police who had symbolized government suppression of dissent. Poor pay and low public esteem have cut the ranks of the police force, according to authorities who also report a rapid rise in crime. Gen. <PERSON> Zenon </PERSON> <PERSON> Trzcinski </PERSON>, the militia's chief commander, said this week the burglary rate has grown the most, from 40,000 in 1979 to 100,000 in 1988 and an estimated 150,000 this year.

 A top Drug Enforcement Administration official says the strain between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agents and <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> officials stemming from the 1985 killing of <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> has been eased by <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s prosecution of those involved. `` I think we've seen very positive signs from the new administration -LRB- in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> -RRB- since last December, particularly the president,'' Acting Deputy <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said in an interview. Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, who took office a year ago, has made vigorous efforts to change his country's image as a haven for drug dealers and corruption by jailing traffickers, arresting corrupt officials and seizing tons of drugs. The successful prosecution and sentencing in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, 37; <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON>, 56; and 10 other men involved in the killings of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and Mexican pilot <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> <PERSON> Avelar </PERSON> has boosted <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> confidence that those charged in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will be brought to justice, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. `` I think this is an extremely positive sign,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> and the others were sentenced Tuesday to 40 years for their roles in the killings. Prison time for related convictions brought <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>'s total sentence to 116 years and <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON>'s to 144. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, a spokesman for Mexican Attorney General <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> would have to serve 74 and 53 years respectively because of time remaining from previous sentences. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said Wednesday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` pleased that those responsible for these brutal murders have been brought to justice.'' `` These convictions further demonstrate the resolve of the <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> administration in its fight against drug trafficking,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. `` We look forward to continued cooperation of the Mexican government in the battle against this common threat to the national security and well-being of both our countries.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support of Mexican actions follows years of tension illustrated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contentions that <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> authorities had allowed <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> to escape to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, where he was captured. In an effort to pressure the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government for action, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> virtually blocked the border by conducting full searches of all Mexicans trying to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It was revealed in July that <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> had bribed <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> prison officials to let them live in luxury accommodations they had built inside the prison. The two were then transferred to maximum-security facilities. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>, 37, was kidnapped Feb. 7, 1985, in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> <PERSON> Avelar </PERSON> was kidnapped a few days later. Their bullet-riddled bodies, showing signs of torture, were found March 5, 1985, wrapped in plastic bags and buried in shallow graves on a ranch 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> killing `` was from the beginning and has continued to remain'' a highly emotional issue for <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents, said <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> never pulled back in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, even immediately after the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> killing, he said. `` We did just the opposite,'' he said. `` We sent additional agents in and our signal at that time was, ` You kill a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent and we'll hound you to the grave'.'' `` We're just continuing to move ahead in our investigation until we're satisfied that every single person who was responsible for his death is brought to justice either in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. Another person charged in connection with the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> case, <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuno </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON>, 59, the brother-in-law of former Mexican President <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Echeverria </PERSON>, was arrested Saturday by <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> as he got off a plane arriving from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zuno </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> pleaded `` absolutely innocent'' Monday to charges that he plotted to torture and kill <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>. Co-defendant <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernabe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> is charged with the felony murder of a federal agent, among other things.

 Police and soldiers battled Wednesday with more than 8,000 blacks protesting the prosecution of neighbors for not paying electric bills. Police said about 400 people were arrested and 12 injured, including six officers. The clash, one of the largest in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> this year, occurred when blacks began a march toward the courthouse in <LOCATION> Ermelo </LOCATION>, 120 miles east of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, despite having been denied permission for the protest. Police headquarters said marchers began throwing stones after officers tried to disperse them with tear gas and stun grenades. Officers then fired birdshot, injuring at least six people, including a child, police said. The five wounded adults were held in custody to face charges of public violence, while 397 people arrested at the courthouse were released with a warning, police said. While the clash was in progress, government offices in <LOCATION> Ermelo </LOCATION>'s black township were firebombed, police said The marchers were protesting the start of court proceedings against 88 residents of the township for not paying electric bills. Earlier Wednesday, police reported three more deaths in factional fighting between rival black groups near <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, bringing the death toll around the port city this month to 71. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said 380 police reinforcements were bening sent into the area's embattled shantytowns. Several dozen other blacks have been killed elsewhere in <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> this month in an escalation of a political power struggle that has claimed about 2,500 lives in three years. Police also reported more violence related to a six-week strike by more than 20,000 black employees of the state transport company, which runs rail and harbor operations nationwide. Five coaches were set afire and a constable was thrown to his death from a moving train near <LOCATION> Kathlehong </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. South African <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said it fired 2,477 more strikers, raising to 15,094 the number dismissed during the strike. The strikers are demanding an increase of their minimum monthly wage from $ 225 to $ 560. The main combatants in the <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> violence are the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a nationwide anti-apartheid coalition, and <ORGANIZATION> Inkatha </ORGANIZATION>, 1.5 million-member political group headed by <PERSON> Zulu </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Mangosuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>. Both groups oppose apartheid, but they have been battling each other for supremacy in <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> since late 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which is aligned with the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, favors protests, strikes and sanctions to pressure the white-run government. The relatively conservative <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> does not support such measures and has been criticized by the front for participating in the black homeland system. Both groups concede they do not have full control of all their supporters. Hundreds of residents in the townships have fled their homes, and some are living with white friends or employers in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>.

 A 14-year-old boy has received a life term without parole for twice raping an elderly woman when he was 13. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who was sentenced Tuesday, would have been eligible for parole after 25 years if he had killed his victim and received life for first-degree murder, Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaden </PERSON> said Wednesday. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law does n't provide for paroling criminals given life terms in certain non-capital cases, <PERSON> Kaden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s past criminal record and other crimes committed in connection with the rapes gave him a sentencing guideline score that called for life, <PERSON> Kaden </PERSON> said. `` I'm going to try to send him away for as long as I can,'' Circuit Judge <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Geeker </PERSON> said before imposing two concurrent life sentences on the <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> youngster. Regardless of the boy's age, he deserved the maximum sentence because of his long criminal history, including an assault on a mental health clinic counselor and a burglary during which he killed a dog, <PERSON> Kaden </PERSON> told the judge. <PERSON> Geeker </PERSON> agreed. `` He is beyond help,'' the judge said. `` The juvenile system has been utterly incapable of doing anything with Mr. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Kaden </PERSON> said he expected the case to be appealed. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Plant </PERSON>, said Wednesday that he does n't handle appellate work but that the court would appoint an attorney for the youth if he wanted to appeal A jury convicted <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> as an adult of burglary, theft and sexual battery after about 30 minutes of deliberation Nov. 30. He was accused of breaking into the 74-year-old woman's home while she was away May 4 and stealing jewelry and cash and then returning the same day to rape her twice at knifepoint. `` I have fears. I have nightmares,'' the woman told <PERSON> Geeker </PERSON> before he sentenced <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. `` It has had a bad psychological effect on me.'' She said he probably would have killed her if neighbors had not called for help. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said nothing at the hearing and showed no emotion as the sentence was pronounced. `` He did n't have any reaction at all,'' Plant said in a telephone interview. `` He was just kind of emotionless.'' Plant said the youth had insisted all along he was innocent. `` That's quite a sentence,'' Plant said. `` He had quite a criminal history, but I think he would be a candidate for rehabilitation.'' Plant agreed that the boy's sentence was tougher than what he probably would have received for a murder conviction. A first-degree murder conviction can be punished by death and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has upheld such sentences for murderers as young as 16, but has not ruled on cases involving younger children.

 Moslem separatists freed the daughter of a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister Wednesday after the government released five of their jailed comrades, officials said. <PERSON> Rubaiya </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, daughter of Home Minister <PERSON> Mufti </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, was taken to a friend's home in this northern city two hours after the militants were freed downtown, police said. Ms. <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, 22, was flown to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> later and met at the airport by her father, mother, brother and sister. She hugged her father, then buried her face on his shoulder and cried. Young Moslem men celebrated the militants' release by shooting off firecrackers in <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>, summer capital of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s northernmost state of <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> About 3,000 people shouted anti-India slogans and waved the national flag of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which has fought three wars with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> since both nations gained independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. Ms. <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON> was abducted at gunpoint Dec. 8 as she was going home from her job at a <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION> hospital. The <ORGANIZATION> Kashmir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which demands secession from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> of the mainly Moslem state from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, claimed responsibility for the abduction. Its chairman said the group might try other kidnappings in its campaign against the Hindu-dominated government. The kidnappers had threatened to kill Ms. <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON> if their colleagues were not freed. <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON> is the first Moslem to head the Home Ministry, which is in charge of internal security. The appointment was seen as part of Prime Minister V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s efforts to appease Moslems, who bore the brunt of Hindu-Moslem riots that claimed more than 300 lives this fall. The kidnapping was the first crisis for <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a Hindu who took office Dec. 2. Earlier Wednesday, <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, unshaven and wrapped in a brown shawl, said solving the militant campaign in <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> was the government's `` No. 1 priority program.'' `` There is a complete collapse of law and order in the state,'' he said. The freed militants include <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheikh </PERSON>, a top leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Kashmir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Sheikh, who was wounded in a clash with police last month and arrested, was taken by ambulance from a <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION> hospital and handed over to his organization, the officials said. The other four were identified as <PERSON> Noor </PERSON> <PERSON> Homammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalwal </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Altaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhat </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Azad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Javed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zargar </PERSON>. All had been arrested on suspicion of subversive activities during the past year but no charges have been filed. The <ORGANIZATION> Kashmir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, formed in 1965, wants <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s only Moslem-majority state, to become independent or part of predominantly Moslem <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The chairman of the group, <PERSON> Amanullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> that he hoped the Indian government would `` adopt a similar wise attitude toward the future of <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> ... instead of waiting until it is shunted out and humiliated by <PERSON> Kashmiri </PERSON> freedom fighters.'' <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> had denounced the kidnapping as contrary to Islamic precepts, presumably referring to Islamic tradition, which imposes rigid guidelines on the treatment of women. <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> dismissed the criticism, saying Indian paramilitary troops `` have killed 300 of our people in the last one and a half years, including women.'' Asked if his militant organization would try other kidnappings as part of its secession campaign, <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> replied: `` It depends on how the Indian government behaves.'' Moslems make up 64 percent of the state's 5 million peoeple but only about 12 percent of the country's 880 million people. Hindus account for about 80 percent. <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> is claimed by both <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the two countries have fought three wars over the territory since gaining independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. A cease-fire line monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> separates the state into Indian and Pakistani territory.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> appeals court today overturned the murder conviction of a black high school janitor who contended his prosecution in the 1980 rape and slaying of a white teen-ager was racially motivated. The prosecution of 38-year-old <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> was marked by `` blatant unfairness,'' the court said in granting the nine-year Death Row inmate a new trial. But the court did not directly address the question of racism. <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> was convicted of murdering 16-year-old <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Fergeson </PERSON> at a high school. His first trial ended with a hung jury. An all-white jury found him guilty in a second trial. `` I'm trying to hold back the tears,'' <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>, a former high school janitor, said from prison in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> today. `` It's made my Christmas. It's been a long time. It's something I did n't think was coming.'' Defense attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGeurin </PERSON> said he would ask for <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>'s release on bail while prosecutors decide whether to seek a new trial If the court agrees and <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> makes bail, `` he'll be out before Christmas,'' <PERSON> DeGeurin </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Speers </PERSON> did not immediately return calls for comment on the ruling and on whether he would pursue a third trial. The appeals court, in a 6-3 opinion, said the state's investigative procedures lacked `` the rudiments of fairness. Among examples cited by the court were that another janitor who testified for the state allegedly was threatened by a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Ranger, and that the state suppressed information that could have implicated someone else. `` The principles of due process embodied within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Constitution, must not, indeed can not, countenance such blatant unfairness,'' wrote Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berchelmann </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. In 1987, after a 10-day hearing, retired District Judge <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON> recommended that <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> get a new trial, ruling that the previous two had been tainted with racism. <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>'s attorneys have offered evidence that police and prosecutors had set out to prove that <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>, the only black janitor at the school, was guilty rather than seeking the real killer. During the 1987 hearing, <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON> was told that the district attorney and trial judge met secretly on strategy against <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>. Prosecutors have denied <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> was the subject of racial discrimination. `` Thank you, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>!'' <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ola </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>, said when she heard the court's decision. Mrs. <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Conroe </LOCATION>, said she is confident a new trial will prove her son's innocence `` I think they have evidence to turn him lose,'' she said. `` My child did n't do that. We're hoping and all we do can is pray.''

 Police have found a rural hideout used by two suspected <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> terrorists who were arrested last week, the federal prosecutor's office reported Wednesday.

 Astronomers have spotted the most distant known star in the Milky Way, and say the accidental discovery could help determine the total mass of the galaxy. That includes mysterious invisible matter that astronomers know exists but are unable to identify, an astronomer with the <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telescope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` Astronomers suspect that there is a lot of additional material surrounding our galaxy that does n't give off light,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, who along with two others discovered the distant star last spring. `` We do n't know the mass of the Milky Way, but if we can find objects that are far out and measure their speed, it will help us determine the galaxy's total mass _ the visible areas and the dark areas.'' Astronomers use the speed of stars to determine gravitational pull upon them, and from its gravity, the mass of the galaxy. Astronomers theorize the galaxy's dark matter could be dim stars that are too faint to be seen, black hole remnants of massive stars that exploded early in the galaxy's history or some unknown type of subatomic particle, <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said. `` We used to think that the majority of the mass of the Milky Way was stars, but now we suspect stars may only be 10 percent of all the mass,'' he said. Once the mystery of the dark matter is solved, he said, `` we may find something completely unexpected that could revolutionize our thinking about physics.'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraknoi </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Astronomical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said the discovery is important because it is another confirmation that the Milky Way is much larger than once thought. `` When you look at in a larger context that's what makes this so exciting _ if they've really found something so distant that it is way beyond where we thought the borders of the galaxy lay,'' he said. The scientists stumbled upon the star while studying a distant galaxy. The star is located 160,000 light years from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> in the direction of the constellation Virgo. The Milky Way was once thought to be only about 100,000 lights year across. Since the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> is about 30,000 light years from the center of the Milky Way, the discovery means the galaxy is larger than even more recent estimates indicated. `` It was just dumb luck that this star was in the way of what they were looking at. It was totally serendipitous,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Villard </PERSON>, a spokesman for the institute. `` It just shows that there are a lot of wonderful surprises out there that we may stumble upon when we're looking for something else.'' The star is an isolated member of an immense but thinly populated halo of old, faint stars surrounding the Milky Way. It was spotted while astronomers <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciardullo </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacoby </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Optical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, were surveying the giant elliptical galaxy M49, which is 50 million light-years from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ciardullo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jacoby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> have observed the star using telescopes in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, and measurements of its brightness have been made at the <ORGANIZATION> Cerro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tololo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interamerican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. The star is a member of a well-known class of stars called the RR Lyrae variables, <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said. Because the brightness of those stars already has been documented, astronomers can use the brightness of the new star, known only as the `` Virgo variable,'' to measure its distance, he said.

 Black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, expected to be released within weeks after 27 years in jail, visited President F.W. de Klerk on Wednesday to discuss prospects for negotiating an end to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s racial conflict. The main far-right party denounced the meeting, the first between <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, as a step toward white capitulation. Liberal leaders, however, hailed the event as evidence the government accepts the central role of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s outlawed guerrilla movement, the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in any political settlement. The meeting took place against the backdrop of one of the worst clashes in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> this year, as police and soldiers battled with more than 8,000 blacks protesting the prosecution of neighbors for not paying electric bills. Police said about 400 people were arrested and 12 injured, including six officers, in the incident near <LOCATION> Ermelo </LOCATION>, 120 miles east of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> requested the meeting at <LOCATION> Tuynhuis </LOCATION>, the presidential office in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, and that <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> `` welcomed the opportunity.'' <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the country's best-known black leader, has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for plotting an anti-government sabotage campaign. The meeting was <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s second with a South African president this year. He met with P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> on July 5, also at <LOCATION> Tuynhuis </LOCATION>. Since replacing <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> on Aug. 15, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has made several conciliatory moves toward the black majority in an effort to ease racial tensions. He has loosened restrictions on anti-government protests, met with prominent opposition leaders, ordered desgregation of whites-only beaches, traveled to several black-ruled African states, and proposed the repeal of the Separate Amenities Act, which permits the segregation of many public facilities. On Oct. 15, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> ordered the unconditional release of seven of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> colleagues. The lack of violence related to their release is seen as a factor that makes <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s freedom likely. The two discussed `` ways and means to address current obstacles in the way of meaningful dialogue,'' the ministry said. `` Follow-up talks in the new year are envisaged.'' The talks `` fitted in with Mr. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s program to consult with the full spectrum of political opinion concerning the mutual future of all South Africans,'' the statement said. The far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which won 31 percent of the white vote in September's parliamentary elections, said the meeting represented a de facto legalization of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. The Conservative leader, <PERSON> Andries </PERSON> <PERSON> Treurnicht </PERSON>, condemned de Klerk for meeting the leader of `` a banned terrorist organization'' and said the president underestimated whites' desire to retain full political sovereignty. The anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> welcomed the meeting and said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> should take the further step of agreeing to talks with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s exiled leadership. There was no immediate reaction from the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> to Wednesday's meeting <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebina </PERSON>, a spokesman at headquarters in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, said he might have a statement Thursday after consulting with his superiors. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said, `` We applaud the meeting'' between <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>. `` We view the commencement of a dialogue between the government and credible representatives of the black majority as the most important first step in the process of change,'' he said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION>, said the meeting was `` symbolic of the very important change that's taken place in government thinking.'' `` There is now a recognition by the government of Mr. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s importance ... and the importance of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said `` Slowly but surely a climate is being built up where there can be formal negotiations about a new constitutional order.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> says he wants to end racial discrimination and extend political rights to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 28 million blacks within five years. However, he opposes black majority rule and a one-person, one-vote system. He envisions some mechanism that will give whites veto power on major policy decisions. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 71, is not likely to be released this year, but government sources have said he probably will be freed before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> convenes in early February. All prominent black leaders, even conservative ones, say <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release is a precondition for negotiations with the government. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, says it will not enter talks until the 3 -LCB- - year-old state of emergency is lifted, all political prisoners are freed, and remaining segregation laws repealed Although its bombing and sabotage campaign has been virtually dormant in recent months, the movement has refused to repudiate violence. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> says he is ready to talk without preconditions to any political leaders and groups committed to peaceful solutions, but he has rejected the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s demand that non-racial elections be held for an assembly to draft a post-apartheid constitution. He insists the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is only one of several black political groups that should participate in negotiations. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is held in a suburban-style staff residence at <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Verster </PERSON> prison farm near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> and has met regularly with anti-apartheid leaders and with Cabinet ministers.

<HEAD>60 Percent of Workers Surveyed Back Some Form of Testing</HEAD>

 Sixty percent of American workers favor on-the-job drug testing, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday by a corporate group that said the results give `` a green light'' to increased employer testing. The survey, done for a newly formed organization of 14 large corporations concerned about employers' rights, said workers tended to support some programs over others. For example, 51 percent of the 1,007 employees polled indicated that companies should have the right to randomly test any employee for drug use. Support rose to 70 percent for testing employees `` suspected of drug usage.'' Twenty-four percent of the workers said they had seen or heard of drug use by co-workers on the job. On the broadest question, 60 percent of the sample said they favored their company adopting some sort of drug-testing policy. Not counted were 9 percent whose employers already have such a program. Support for testing was strongest from workers in rural areas, those 55 and older, and those with an education of high school or less. Fourteen percent of those who did not attend college opposed drug testing at their company, compared to 28 percent for those with a college degree and 48 percent for those who had done post-graduate work. `` Workers' attitudes are far more conservative than we had anticipated,'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON>, executive director of the new Institute for a Drug-Free Workplace, said in a statement. `` Employees simply do not want to tolerate working with drug abusers on the job,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> said. `` More significantly, the survey reaffirms the policy of increasing numbers of employers who are drug testing, and gives a clear and unmistakable green light to further testing of employees and job applicants.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in June that employers can not unilaterally begin testing unionized workers for drug use, but can test job applicants regardless of whether unions object. The board said employee testing falls under collective bargaining and therefore must be the subject of union-management negotiations. There was no immediate comment from the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> to the survey, which did show employee reservations about drug testing. In one question, only 26 percent of respondents agreed that testing was `` a necessity.'' Forty-two percent said it should be done despite reservations, while 29 percent said it invaded privacy and should be done only under limited circumstances. The workers gave their highest support for drug testing of workers in safety-sensitive jobs. The 14 corporatons in the institute each have some sort of drug-testing program, de <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> said. They are <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman-La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Nutley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Schaumberg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> 3M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION>. The institute hired the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which interviewed a random sample of 1,007 full-time workers around the nation last month. Forty-two percent of those surveyed described their occupation as professional, 25 percent as blue collar, 20 percent as managerial and 10 percent as secretarial or clerical. The rest were `` other'' or refused to answer the question. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed legislation today clearing the way to expand Everglades National Park and ordering the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> to restore the natural flow of water to the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> `` river of grass.'' He also signed a measure providing federal matching funds to help preserve critical wetlands in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. He said the bills will help achieve his campaign goal of `` no net loss of wetlands.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed the North American Wetlands Conservation Act in a ceremony in the Roosevelt Room after signing the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> measure. The wetlands act will provide more than $ 70 million over four years to help purchase and preserve wetlands, which serve as vital feeding areas for ducks and other migratory fowl. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the dwindling population of ducks `` is largely attributable to the steady loss of wetland areas that we've experienced. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been losing wetlands at the rate of nearly 400,000 acres a year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does not favor a ban on development projects that destroy wetlands, but wants any development offset with an equal amount of acreage restored as wetlands. `` Even in times of serious fiscal constraints, we can still meet our highest environmental priorities and this is one of mine,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in signing the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> legislation. The 107,600-acre expansion will be undertaken in cooperation with the state of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, which will donate 35,000 new acres to the federal park. The government estimates it will cost $ 40 million to acquire the rest of the new acreage, with <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> havin agreed to pay 20 percent of the costs. The Everglades, the second largest national park in the 48 contiguous states, are home to 13 endangered species, but problems with the flow of waters have harmed the habitat for both birds and alligators. `` The woodstork, heron, ibis, egret and roseate spoonbill have all declined dramatically over the years,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panther, the alligator and many species of fish are declining.'' `` The <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Slough </LOCATION>, the river of grass through southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, has been both too shallow and too deep,'' the president said. `` Through this legislation that river of grass may now be restored to its natural flow of water.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> first enacted legislation in 1944 to create Everglades National Park, and it was dedicated by President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> in 1947. Efforts to drain and reclaim wetlands from the 1880s through the 1930s drastically reduced the natural flow of water through the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> in 1948 helped reduce the damaging flow of salt water and provided flood control, but left some areas with too much water and others with too little. The new legislation will require the corps to modify the Central and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> at an estimated cost of $ 45 million. It also puts limits on the use of waterboats in the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, with current users allowed to keep using the craft on existing routes.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it had delayed the pre-Christmas launch of space shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> at least two days because of lagging work at the launch pad. A statement said the new date of Dec. 20 is `` success oriented,'' meaning that any minor new problem could slip the liftoff to the 21st. It said additional time is needed to validate systems on recently renovated launch pad 39A and to prepare <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. `` We feel confident about readiness for a pre-Christmas liftoff,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenoir </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s associate administrator for space flight. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristofferson </PERSON> said a lot of small problems, many associated with new pad facilities, had put launch crews behind schedule. If liftoff slipped to Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, it probably would be postponed a few more days to free workers for the holiday. With the change, the shuttle swapped launch dates with a Titan 3 commercial rocket that had been scheduled for liftoff on Dec. 20. The Titan, which is to boost British and Japanese communications satellites, was rescheduled for 7:20 p.m. EST Monday. During a 10-day mission, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s five astronauts are to put a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> communications satellite into orbit and recover a science satellite before it falls to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The satellite has been in orbit nearly six years and is expected to re-enter the atmosphere in February. The flight duration will equal the longest shuttle mission to date and will be a stepping stone for even longer flights as <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> is being modified to stay aloft for 16 days and later for 28 days. Loading of propellants for <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s in-flight propulsion systems and auxiliary power units began a day late Monday because a faulty connector on an electronics box had to be replaced. Once the fueling began, the launch pad had to be cleared of all non-essential personnel because it is dangerous. That prevented workers from making up lost time in other areas. Work was running late even before the connector problem because of difficulties working with new systems on a mobile launch platform being used for the first time and with the launch pad, which recently underwent a two-year, $ 50 million refurbishment, receiving 130 modifications. In announcing a Dec. 18 launch date, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> cautioned last week that the flight might have to be delayed a day or so because of the new systems. Astronaut <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandenstein </PERSON> will command <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s crew. The other crew members are pilot <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetherbee </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivins </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Low </PERSON>.

 Even militant anti-apartheid leaders acknowledge that President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, during four months in power, has moved faster toward political reform than any of his predecessors. But leading activists remain deeply suspicious of him, suggesting he wants to ease international pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> without forfeiting the white minority's ultimate hold on power. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, 53, is viewed as an affable pragmatist, earnest but not charismatic. He has pledged to phase out discrimination, and has not shied away from confrontations with right-wing whites who want to maintain strict apartheid. However, he maintains his long-standing belief that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> politics must be conducted along racial lines. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> was a lawyer before entering <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1973.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Shrinks to Smallest Figure in Nearly 6 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recorded its best trade performance in almost six years from July through September as the deficit in the broadest measure of trade shrank 29 percent to $ 22.69 billion, the government reported Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the current account deficit narrowed by $ 9.40 billion from a second quarter imbalance of $ 32.08 billion, reflecting a big jump in the overseas earnings of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. But economists discounted the huge swing, saying it did nothing to change their view that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trade deficit will remain stuck at a high level through most of the next decade. However, analysts were more upbeat about a second report Wednesday showing that retail sales, spurred by strong spending on clothing and furniture, jumped 0.8 percent in November, the biggest gain in four months. Some economists said the surprisingly strong sales report, at the start of the all-important Christmas sales season, should help alleviate fears that the economy could be on the verge of tumbling into a recession. The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is the most important trade statistic because it measures not only trade in merchandise but also trade in services, the category that includes investment earnings between countries. For the third quarter, the services category registered a surplus of $ 8.72 billion after posting a $ 1.66 billion deficit from April through June, the first services deficit in three decades. But the services swing from deficit to surplus was attributed almost totally to changes in the value of the dollar. In the third quarter, the dollar was declining, meaning that the profits <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies earn in foreign currencies were worth more when they were translated into dollars. In the second quarter, a rising dollar had eaten into the profits Americans companies were earning in foreign currencies. The big swing in services helped offset a small increase in the merchandise trade deficit, which climbed 0.7 percent to $ 27.75 billion in the third quarter, and a rise in foreign aid and pension payments, the other category of the current account, which climbed to $ 3.66 billion, an increase of 27 percent. Analysts forecast that the merchandise trade deficit will remain at stubbornly high levels in coming years and predicted that the services account will dip permanently into deficit sometime early in the 1990s, reflecting the fact that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is now the world's largest debtor nation. As residents of a debtor nation, Americans hold less in overseas assets than foreigners hold in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s net debtor position stood at $ 532.5 billion at the end of last year and is expected to worsen by an additional $ 100 billion this year. That means that more and more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wealth must be transferred into foreign hands in the form of interest payments and profits earned by foreign companies doing business in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The net debtor number is clearly moving in the wrong direction,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <PERSON> DRI-McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. `` We are still borrowing money from overseas and that means that our interest payments to foreigners will be going up.'' At the start of this decade, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was running surpluses in its current account because earnings from American investments abroad were enough to offset perennial deficits in merchandise trade. But as Americans transferred billions of dollars into foreign hands to pay for merchandise imports, the investment cushion shrank rapidly and disappeared altogether in 1985, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said the third quarter current account deficit, the smallest since a $ 20.9 billion imbalance in the first quarter of 1984, could be the last good news in this trade measure for some time. Through the first nine months of this year, the current account deficit was running at an annual rate of $ 113.55 billion, down only modestly from the $ 126.55 billion deficit recorded in 1988. The government is scheduled to report Friday the monthly merchandise trade figure for October, the first look at how trade is doing in the fourth quarter. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, predicted that the October deficit figure could surge to $ 9.8 billion, up from a September deficit of $ 7.9 billion. He predicted the monthly merchandise trade deficit would likely remain stuck at the $ 9 billion level for many months.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is urging consumers not to use an over-the-counter food supplement distributed by a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> company because some bottles contain capsules with potentially fatal levels of stannous fluoride. <ORGANIZATION> Vitamin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Specialities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Wyncote </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, has asked its 22 retail stores in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to recall acidophilus capsules with lot number 069296 and has notified 140 mail-order customers, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said. The product is manufactured by Vita-Pure, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said in a release. According to the product label, the acidophilus capsules supply `` friendly bacteria to the intestinal tract'' and help restore and maintain the mucous membrane that lines the stomach and intestines. The company began the recall in late October after two consumers complained of vomiting and flu-like symptoms after using the product, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. However, <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said it was concerned that many consumers may still be unaware of the problem because only a small number of bottles were returned. An <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> analysis found that smaller capsules were mixed with slightly larger acidophilus capsules. The smaller capsules were found to have an average 784 milligrams of stannous fluoride. Stannous fluoride, used in toothpaste, is safe in small amounts. However, a 784-milligram dose could cause convulsions in an adult and could be lethal for a small child, the agency said. Five capsules could kill an adult. High doses of stannous fluoride can cause gastrointestinal upset and vomiting, which could limit the amount ingested and the adverse effects, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> appealed to the world's wealthiest countries Wednesday to make good on their promises of aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> so the new leaders in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> can `` put food on the table and goods on the shelves of stores.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> described the plight of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as winter approaches as severe. `` Pledges alone are n't enough,'' he told a meeting of two dozen foreign ministers as they committed their treasuries to a coordinated assistance program valued at up to $ 6 billion in the next several years. Most of the aid takes the form of investment and trade credits not to be paid out immediately. Included in the assistance is a $ 200 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contribution to a $ 1 billion stablization fund for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Additionally, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> announced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would provide $ 200 million to a 10-nation $ 500 million `` bridge loan'' for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> that is to help tide the country past the Christmas season until the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> declares it qualifies for a comprehensive aid program. Except for the $ 200 million, which comes out of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> fund, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last month appropriated $ 938 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary, has taken the lead within the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration in encouraging Eastern European countries to adopt market economies. As a lure, he dangles <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. Just before coming to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for talks with reformist Prime Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>. He promised the administration would consider economic support if the country continued to revise its economy and carried out a pledge to hold multiparty elections in May. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told the foreign ministers that `` the multiplying effects of people power are creating a new East-West equation. Ordinary men and women are peacefully asserting their basic human rights on a scale unimagined at the start of the year.'' But, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> went on, `` It is our task to support this courageous reform effort. After the streets emplty of demonstrators, after the people select new leaders, after governments become the servants of the people, after all this _ the economies must put food on the table and goods on the shelves of stores.''

 A member of a Soviet acting troupe who defected to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said Wednesday she loves her homeland but came to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for more freedom. `` I love the people of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and I love the people here. But I must ... tell you I have one dream. Without this dream, I ca n't live,'' said <PERSON> Larisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Firsova </PERSON>, a 24-year-old actress with the Central Children's Theatre of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Speaking in broken English and at times through an interpreter, <PERSON> Firsova </PERSON> declined to elaborate on her dream, saying it is considered bad luck to discuss such matters. She did acknowledge that it includes becoming an American actress. She said she has applied for political asylum and it is `` almost granted.'' `` I was told that it's all a matter of paperwork and I should just wait a few days,'' said <PERSON> Firsova </PERSON>, who is staying with a couple in the area. She declined to be specific but said she sought political asylum based partly on matters having to do with her husband, <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Firsova </PERSON>, also an actor. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has said it ca n't comment on the case because of confidentiality rules. <PERSON> Firsova </PERSON> did n't show up Monday as members of the troupe assembled at their hotel to head for the airport. The group had been performing as part of an exchange program with the Children's Theater Company of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> The actress appeared at the news conference in the office of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Min., wearing snow boots, gray slacks and a <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vikings </ORGANIZATION> sweatshirt Members of <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>'s staff presented her with an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag that the senator had asked to be flown over the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> as a token of welcome to her. The actress said she would attempt to help her husband emigrate as soon as possible. <PERSON> Firsova </PERSON> said that, while her family did not specifically know that she would defect on this trip, they knew of her desire to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and supported her.

<HEAD>U.S. Assails Salvadoran Rebels for Rejecting Peace Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> criticized the Salvadoran rebels Wednesday for rejecting a peace proposal by Central American presidents, calling the decision a `` tragic, missed opportunity'' to end the bloodshed. The five presidents, meeting in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> earlier this week, appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> rebels `` to immediately and effectively cease hostilities ... and rejoin the previously initiated process of dialogue.'' A communique issued by the presidents called on the insurgents to use the dialogue to achieve their demobilization and expressed explicit support for the Salvadoran government. The rebels angrily denounced the communique, ruling out demobilization. They said the communique gives `` unconditional support to the principal violator of human rights in the region'' _ the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> government. The insurgents said they can not be demobilized because they constitute a `` legitimate force with popular support in the entire Salvadoran territory.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said the rebel statement represents `` a tragic, missed opportunity to end the bloodshed which has plagued <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.'' He contrasted the insurgents' stand with that of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, who has expressed a willingness to reopen talks with the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> once they end their attacks in civilian areas. Discussing the Nicaraguan aspect of the peace process, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> noted that the presidents called for the renewal of cease-fire talks between the Sandinistas and the Contra rebels. He said those discussions broke down last month when the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> unilaterally walked out. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> wish to further the goals of the peace process, including voluntary demobilization, repatriation and reintegration of resistance members under secure and democratic conditions, they should renew their direct talks with the resistance,'' he said. He added that the Sandinistas should also take immediate steps toward further democratization, especially ending the harassment and violence against opposition candidates and supporters and freeing political prisoners. In a concession to the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, the presidents also called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to transfer to a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations-Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> commission <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds being provided to the Contras for food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials would consult closely with Central American, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> officials to determine how best to carry out that aspect of the presidents' communique. `` The important thing is that we believe these people -LRB- the Contras -RRB- continue to need food, clothing and medicine. That's exactly what we are providing,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said

<HEAD>Slightly More Raw Foods Free of Excess Pesticides, FDA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 96 percent of raw foods sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1988 had no pesticide residues or had levels within the legal limit, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. That's a slight increase over 1987, when 95 percent of the foods sampled did not contain illegally high levels of pesticides. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s analysis also showed that 61 percent of the foods sampled in 1988 had no pesticide residues, compared with 57 percent the previous year. Of the nearly 4 percent of foods sampled in the 1988 analysis that contained pesticide residues above the levels allowed, most involved residues for which the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has set no tolerance level, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> sampled 18,114 imported and domestic food products for its latest report, about 25 percent more than in 1987. The analysis found more imports contained higher-than-allowed pesticide residues than domestic foods. Of the 10,475 import samples analyzed, 6 percent contained excessive residues, while about 2 percent of the 7,639 samples of domestic foods exceeded the tolerance level or contained residues of pesticides not permitted for use on that product, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. The study covered 256 pesticides. Vegetables had the highest proportion of excessive pesticide residues at 5.6 percent. A breakdown shows that 7 percent of imported vegetables fall into that category compared with less than 3 percent of domestic products.

<TEXT>
 This tiny Ozarks community proudly calls itself `` <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s Christmas City,'' but there's little holiday cheer this season because the murder of the town's popular bank president remains unsolved. More than two months have passed since <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> was kidnapped from his home in predawn darkness and forced to open the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noel </ORGANIZATION> vault for his abductors, who took about $ 70,000. His kidnappers taped him to a chair weighted with concrete blocks and a 30-pound chain, then threw him from a bridge into an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> lake </LOCATION>, where he drowned. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> says it has no suspects and few leads. Many people in the town of 1,200 near the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> borders believe the odds of finding Short's killers shrink daily because of the lack of suspects and evidence. `` The consensus of people who come in and out of my post office is it will go unsolved,'' Postmaster <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Poage </PERSON> said. Nearly every door on festively decorated Main Street bears a yellow ribbon `` to signify we're waiting for <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>'s killers to be caught,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who bought his hardware store with a loan from Short's bank. The 51-year-old president of the town's lone bank is remembered as a `` genuine nice guy'' and community booster. After moving to <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> in 1986, <PERSON> Short </PERSON> did commentary on radio broadcasts of high school sporting events and wrote a weekly sports column for an area newspaper. Only hours before he was abducted, <PERSON> Short </PERSON> agreed to be master of ceremonies at the community Christmas parade for the third consecutive year. `` He was the kind of guy who, instead of sending someone to get the mail each morning, would walk to the post office and get it himself,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> special agent <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiman </PERSON> said investigators have not found anyone in <PERSON> Short </PERSON>'s 24-year banking career who might want to kill him. What investigators do know is this: About 3 a.m. on Oct. 6, a vehicle believed to be carrying three men drove to <PERSON> Short </PERSON>'s home about five miles southwest of <PERSON> Noel </PERSON>. Short, who lived alone, was awakened and forcibly driven to the bank. Someone also drove <PERSON> Short </PERSON>'s pickup truck to the bank. Two shots from a .45 - caliber revolver disabled the bank's surveillance camera and the lens Short opened the vault and his abductors scooped up cash _ police will say only that it was in the neighborhood of $ 70,000 _ mostly in $ 5 and $ 2 bills and quarters. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> believes the kidnappers intended all along to kill <PERSON> Short </PERSON> after he opened the vault. They bound his hands and feet with duct tape, taped him to an antique chair and tossed him from a bridge into <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cherokees </LOCATION>, about 10 miles west of <PERSON> Noel </PERSON>. His body was found five days later. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Elkins </PERSON>, a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, portrayed Short in a re-enactment of the crime for the syndicated television series `` Hard Copy.'' `` When they tied me up and tipped me over the bridge, I knew there was no danger of me falling but it was still frightening,'' he said. `` At that point, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> knows he's going to get killed. You know he was scared to death.'' Floodlights have gone up around homes since Short's murder, said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Short </PERSON>'s friend and golf partner. The close-knit community will probably never feel totally safe again, he said. Many fear that <PERSON> Short </PERSON> knew his killers and that they are still in the area. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has not ruled out that possibility, <PERSON> Geiman </PERSON> said. Banks in at least three states have posted a $ 50,000 reward, and <PERSON> Geiman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is optimistic the case will eventually be solved. Meanwhile, residents are trying to get on with their lives, hoping that the killers will eventually be brought to justice. `` It's with you 24 hours a day, but you have to get your mind back on business,'' <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said. `` Life goes on.''

<HEAD>Brazil's Presidential Campaign Gets Muddy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The presidential race has taken a turn for the nasty with a campaign spot in which a candidate's ex-girlfriend charges he offered her money to get an abortion when she was pregnant with their daughter `` He ruined my life,'' said <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordeiro </PERSON>, referring to socialist candidate <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Inacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, in an ad broadcast on Tuesday and Wednesday. In addition to talking about their relationship and the couple's illegitimate 15-year-old daughter, Ms. <PERSON> Cordeiro </PERSON> also said <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, known as <PERSON> Lula </PERSON>, was a racist and `` could n't stand blacks. A majority of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s 150 million people are black or mixed-race. The ad was made by <PERSON> Lula </PERSON>'s opponent, <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconstruction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Cordeiro </PERSON> says in the spot that her testimony was voluntary, but a former campaign worker for <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> claims the woman was paid about $ 23,000 for her participation. `` I could n't remain silent facing a case of corruption,'' said the worker, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> <PERSON> Amaral </PERSON>, adding she had quit <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>'s campaign staff after the interview. The Brazilian press has roundly condemned <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>'s tactics `` The campaign reaches the bottom,'' the respected daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Folha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Lula </PERSON>'s campaign coordinator, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomar </PERSON>, called the interview `` baixaria'' _ `` a low blow.'' The candidate says his daughter, <PERSON> Lurian </PERSON>, was born after an affair with Ms. <PERSON> Cordeiro </PERSON> following the death of his first wife in 1969. The press earlier this year `` discovered'' Lurian, but Brazilians did not react strongly to the disclosure. `` He offered me money to get an abortion,'' Ms. <PERSON> Cordeiro </PERSON> said in the spot. `` When she was born, I put her in his lap and said ` Now go ahead and kill her, because when she was in my belly I would n't let you.' <PERSON> Lula </PERSON>, in his own TV spot Wednesday, was shown standing beside <PERSON> Lurian </PERSON>, who was wearing the red-star button of <PERSON> Lula </PERSON>'s Marxist-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` Lurian was the product of a gesture of love,'' the stocky, bearded <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> said. `` To me, all that matters is what my daughter thinks of me. She knows what kind of a father she has.'' After his affair with Ms. <PERSON> Cordeiro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> remarried with <PERSON> Marisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Leticia </PERSON>, the widow of a slain taxi driver, who has one son. The da <PERSON> Silvas </PERSON> had three more sons, and Mrs. <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> takes part in <PERSON> Lula </PERSON>'s campaign rallies The personal accusations were seen as a response to polls showing <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> rapidly catching up as Sunday's runoff election approaches. Collor de Mello previously has portrayed his rival as a communist and a proponent of `` armed struggle.'' A poll published Wednesday by the respected <ORGANIZATION> Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> held a slim 4 percentage point lead over <PERSON> Lula </PERSON>. Just 10 days ago, polls had Collor de Mello leading by 15 points. In the latest survey, the institute interviewed 3,650 people in their homes between Dec. 8 and Dec. 12. It showed 47 percent of those questioned preferred Collor de Mello and 43 percent supported <PERSON> Lula </PERSON>. The margin of error was 2 percent. The two candidates were the top vote-getters in a 21-candidate field in the first-round election Nov. 15. Neither candidate won a majority, and a runoff was set for Sunday. Political analysts said the new ad shows how worried Collor de Mello's supporters are. `` With the desperation of someone who sees a certain victory endangered, Collor de Mello ... has assumed a right-wing posture, of order vs. chaos. He has made the campaign an ideological showdown,'' political columnist <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Noblat </PERSON> wrote Tuesday in the Jornal do Brasil newspaper of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. The election is <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s first popular balloting for president in 29 years. The last free vote was in 1960, when <PERSON> Janio </PERSON> <PERSON> Quadros </PERSON> was elected. He resigned after seven months in office, and three years later the armed forces took power in a coup and ruled the country until 1985. Civilian President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> was chosen by an electoral college controlled by the outgoing generals.

His head was slumped but his hands were hanging onto the window,'' Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> recalled, adding that the car's fumes were `` pretty strong, like it had been running for awhile.'' The man apparently was attempting suicide by carbon-monoxide poisoning and also appeared to have overdosed on drugs, said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. Police believe the 42-year-old man was having `` family problems, marital problems,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. The man was given emergency room treatment, then transferred to a psychiatric hospital, where officials declined to discuss the matter Wednesday. `` What are the chances of this person in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> calling a random number in <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION> and getting a recording'' describing a suicide attempt? <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> asked. `` And what are the chances of listening to the recording and not hanging up,'' he said of Ms. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. `` A lot of people hate talking to recorders.''

<HEAD>Female Santa Says Money Giveaway `Was Fun'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The cheerful Bostonian who flabbergasted bar patrons by handing out money _ $ 100 bills, $ 50s and $ 20s _ shrugs off the uproar she created. `` I'm just me. It's like I had this extra money, so I just started giving it out,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, 53, who describes herself as the daughter of `` an industrial tycoon'' and a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> native. `` It was fun.'' `` People keep asking why,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said, smiling up at reporters during a news conference Tuesday. `` It just happened. ... It's not like I was blowing the rent money.'' She said she was thrilled by the `` smiles that came back. ... It was great; it was great.'' By some estimates, she gave away $ 5,000 in the lounge of a motel near <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> before police asked her to stop. Her generosity was causing traffic jams as would-be recipients stampeded to the scene. The officers, called by concerned tavern owners, also advised her to save a little money for a rainy day. `` I promised the police I would stop giving money away,'' she said Tuesday, but `` I can still do things quietly. `` I think people should maybe read the dictionary and look up the word ` give.''' Until the news conference, Ms. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> had eluded the spotlight since her giveaway late Saturday and early Sunday. And she did not return telephone calls Wednesday. What prompted Tuesday's resurfacing? Hotel manager <PERSON> Lola </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> at the Holiday Inn-Midway, where Ms. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> was staying, asked for a contribution a children's Christmas party the hotel sponsors for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` She said she did n't have any money, but that she could help with publicity,'' Ms. <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> said. As Ms. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> predicted, several reporters turned out for her news conference at the hotel. `` We're using you,'' she said, teasing. After her performance as Mrs. <PERSON> Claus </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> was arrested early Sunday on a misdemeanor disorderly-conduct charge after her <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> stalled near the airport and she was reported trying to direct traffic and creating a ruckus. Ms. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> was released on her own recognizance, pending evaluation at the <ORGANIZATION> Bobby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comprehensive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where officials found no reason to hold her, and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, shift coordinator at the city's <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> department. She said agency workers took Ms. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> to a motel before dawn Sunday. She is to appear in court Jan. 26 on the municipal charge, which carries a penalty of from $ 5 to $ 500, city officials said. Neighbors were perplexed back home in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where Ms. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> has lived for 10 years in a neighborhood of narrow streets with Italian shops and restaurants. `` This is unbelievable, what's going on,'' said an upstairs neighbor, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, who asked that her last name not be used. `` I was shocked,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, owner of the J & amp; B Variety Store around the corner. `` She's never done anything like this since I've known her. She's a normal, average person.''

<HEAD>Tamil Tigers Oust Rival Militia, 60 Killed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BATTICALOA, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A powerful rebel group negotiating with the government for political power ousted a rival militia Wednesday in a battle that killed an estimated 60 people, mostly militiamen, residents said. In a three-pronged attack launched shortly before midnight Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> surrounded the town of <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION>, residents said. One young woman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the rebels came down the coast road from the lagoon and the jungle late Tuesday night. By midmorning Wednesday, she said, the shooting had stopped. By sundown Wednesday, <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> had received 26 bodies. `` Only one was a Tiger,'' a hospital official said. `` The rest were from the other side.'' Like many other people in this town of 60,000 people, he was reluctant to speak the name of the `` other side.'' But they acknowledged they meant the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a group set up shortly before the Indian peacekeeping forces withdrew from <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION> late last month. `` Most of them, according to parents, were forcibly conscripted to fight the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>,'' one hospital employee said. The Sri Lankan government has accused departing Indian troops, at the behest of pro-Indian Tamil groups, of training and arming the Tamil army, which the <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> government has outlawed. The Indian government, which sent peacekeeping soldiers to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> two years ago to put down the Tamil rebellion, has denied allegations it created the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to the 26 bodies at <ORGANIZATION> Batticaloa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, three more were seen along the road leading into town. Young Tiger guerrillas, most in their teens and carrying shining new AK-47 assault rifles, claimed at least 50 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> were killed in the battle. Well-placed residents in <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION> estimate the total death toll at 50 to 60. One said it might be as high as 90. `` The bodies have been pouring in all day and still they are arriving,'' the hospital official said. `` More will come when it is light again and people can find transport.'' The last of the bodies to reach the hospital as darkness fell lay on the floors of vans parked inside the hospital's front gate. At least three had their hands tied behind their backs. In the fading light, their wounds were not clearly visible but all appeared to have been shot in the head or neck. `` My husband. I have lost my husband,'' wailed <PERSON> Nathivathany </PERSON>, in between sobs that shook her entire body. <PERSON> Nathivathany </PERSON>'s husband, Thayaparan, was one of the young men whose bodies lay in a heap in the back of the van. Friends said the young couple had been married only a short time. But elsewhere in the town, there was an air of calm, with teen-age <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> standing along the streets in twos and fours. Red-and-white banners erected by the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> proclaimed `` great heroes days'' in the Tamil language. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> were very polite when they came into town after the shooting,'' said an English-speaking woman. `` People gave them tea and said we had dreams for the liberation of <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION>. `` Eighteen months ago people of <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION> compained about our Tamil militia _ including the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> _ saying they had been forced to contribute money, provide free food and even their own television sets,'' said the woman, also speaking on condition of anonymity. But as the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> tried to enter the political mainstream, they also had embarked on a public relations campaign, one that seems to be working. The <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> does not enjoy the same support. <LOCATION> Batticaola </LOCATION> is 135 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> and is one of the two eastern districts where <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> pulled out 10,000 of its troops in the past two months. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has said the remaining 26,000 troops will be out of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> by Dec. 31.

<TEXT>
 An American church worker accused of storing weapons for leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> was released from prison today into the custody of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador. President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Thomaston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, was released after 2 -LCB- weeks in jail because of insufficient evidence and would be deported. He said she would be asked to remain a witness in the case. `` If the evidence against her becomes sufficient, she will be summoned to return for trial,'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> told a news conference, although he acknowledged little could be done to force her to return. Shortly afterwards, reporters staking out the <LOCATION> Ilopango </LOCATION> prison saw Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> leave in a black Cadillac with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. The Cadillac was escorted by a caravan of Jeeps. There was no opportunity for Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> to comment and no indication where the caravan was headed. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said he thought Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> probably had in fact cooperated with rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, who launched a major urban offensive in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> last month. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said she was being released only because legally there was not enough evidence to hold her. `` I am morally convinced that Miss Casolo is guilty,'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said. He said she was being freed only because of lack of evidence. The president said he had not been pressured by the government of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to order Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s release. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a key financial supporter of the rightist government in its war with the rebels. Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> was charged with acts of terrorism, possessing weapons of war and criminal association. She denied the charges. Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., said earlier today he had been told in telephone conversations with Salvadoran officials, including <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, that Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> would be released and expelled from the country by Thursday afternoon <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> `` informs me that the judge in her case has ultimately concluded the charges against <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> were not fully supported by the evidence, and that she could not thus be fairly prosecuted under Salvadoran law,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said in a statement released by his office. Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in 1985 to work for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminars </ORGANIZATION>, a group that organizes tours for Americans to learn about the 10-year-old civil war. Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> and two Salvadoran friends were arrested Nov. 26 after a police raid on her house in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. From the walled garden behind the house, police said, they uncovered 103 mortar grenades, 213 blocks of dynamite, 405 detonators, 150 feet of slow-burning fuse and 21,945 rounds of ammunition for Soviet-made automatic rifles. Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> is to be expelled from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, according to the agreement reached with Salvadoran officials, <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said. On Tuesday, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Salaverria </PERSON>, said Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> would be released if she provided police with information about the people from whom she rented her house.

 Sirens wailed across <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> at noon Wednesday to mark the eighth anniversary of the 1981 martial-law crackdown, which <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> declared should be a reminder of the need for `` pluralism and tolerance.'' Hundreds of young people took to the streets in five cities, however, hurling rocks and firebombs to express anger at the crackdown and demand punishment for those responsible. In the most open discussion to date of the decision, newspapers were filled with articles examining Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s Dec. 13, 1981, declaration to suppress the Solidarity labor movement. `` Before December 1981 Solidarity did not appreciate the strength of the authorities,'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. `` After December 1981, the authorities did not appreciate the strength of Solidarity.'' In the crackdown, carried out with military precision, communication to the outside world was cut, thousands of Solidarity activists were rounded up and interned, the union was ordered suspended and at least nine miners died resisting authorities. Eight years after the event, Solidarity has not only regained legal status but it has taken control of the government from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. However, activists allowed <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> to be elected president in July with the minimum number of votes required. While older Solidarity activists approached the anniversary somberly, hundreds of demonstrators in <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION> hurled firebombs and paint at the doors of the provincial party headquarters, state radio reported. In <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>, several hundred teen-agers rallied and marched to police headquarters where they burned <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> in effigy, chanted `` Down with Communism,'' and threw stones and bottles at the building before police turned water cannons on them, radio said. A group of demonstrators attacked police headquarters with stones in <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION> and officers responded with truncheons, the state <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. Smaller anti-communist marches also took place outside the national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and, according to state television, in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>. In his message to mark the anniversary, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> muted his criticism while stressing that there should be efforts at reconciliation. Whether Polish national interests required the implementation of martial law is a question `` that belongs to historians,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` However one does not need scientific analysis to see the senselessness of the human losses and persecutions, the campaign of slanders and humiliations, the cult of force and the pacifying of public life. `` Today the tragedy of martial law reminds us of the need for cultured politics, pluralism and tolerance. The dramatic experiences of those days can not be repeated, because _ among other things _ we are wiser from those experiences. `` The tragedy of martial law can not overshadow the future, and the squaring of accounts can not replace the striving for a just and prosperous <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. Government spokeswoman <PERSON> Malgorzata </PERSON> <PERSON> Niezabitowska </PERSON> said the date has deep meaning for her, especially sitting in a government where `` literally, those who eight years ago were arrested and those who gave and signed the orders sit side by side.'' The fact the two sides could overcome their differences proves that `` those eight years, which were very hard and brought a lot of misfortunes, were not wasted. They became a lesson for both sides. The Communist side became convinced that without the participation of society it is not possible to govern. The opposition was shown that relentlessness in striving for freedom has got to be combined with political realism.'' Government spokeswoman <PERSON> Malgorzata </PERSON> <PERSON> Niezabitowska </PERSON> said the date has deep meaning for her, especially sitting in a government where `` literally, those who eight years ago were arrested and those who gave and signed the orders sit side by side.'' The fact the two sides could overcome their differences proves that `` those eight years, which were very hard and brought a lot of misfortunes, were not wasted. They became a lesson for both sides. The Communist side became convinced that without the participation of society it is not possible to govern. The opposition was shown that relentlessness in striving for freedom has got to be combined with political realism.'' Solidarity had called on factories nationwide to sound sirens at noon in memory of the day still vividly and painfully remembered. Among those interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> weekly Polityka were Col. <PERSON> Wieslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Gornicki </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s close aide, who said at the time he believed martial law was inevitable, although today he is unsure whether moderates on both sides could have prevented it. <PERSON> Gornicki </PERSON> said the public should remember Soviet pressure on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s `` threats, about which the public still knows too little.'' At a March 1982 meeting with <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> `` sneered'' that martial law was a `` lamentable half measure'' and authorities should be even tougher, <PERSON> Gornicki </PERSON> said. Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, whose police and riot troops carried out the crackdown, told the newspaper he regrets the `` injustice and harm'' that people feel, but that as a historical experience martial law `` turned out to be educative and valuable.'' `` From this experience stems the success of dialogue and today's essentially changing <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' he said. In a commentary, <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> said it is possible to discuss martial law `` in a calmer way.'' Justified non-violent resistance to martial law and loyalty to Solidarity through the difficult years finally allowed `` a historic breakthrough,'' it said. `` Though the price we have had to pay is great, all those years were not a lost time.''

 What appeared to be a prank call to the police turned out to be a very wrong number for a drug dealer. `` It was kind of a humorous situation,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> of the Narcotics Division of the state's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>. `` Here we have this mope that's calling us and he has no idea of who he is talking to.'' Public Safety Commissioner <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> said it all began when the phone rang in the agency's narcotics division. `` The guy said something like, ` Is Al there?' and our agent said, ` No, this is <PERSON> John </PERSON>,''' said <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>. The suspect then went on to describe a drug transaction that had apparently been arranged with the mysterious Al. At first agents thought it was a nuisance call, but the suspect became insistent, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` It proceeded to the point where we decided this guy was serious, he really wanted to sell drugs,'' said <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` So we started with the role-playing.'' After the agents went through the requisite haggling, a transaction was set up allowing undercover agents to purchase a small amount of marijuana. The buy was set up for Tuesday in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, and two men were charged with delivery of marijuana. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said the transaction involved about four ounces of the drug. ` Once in a while, we have an interesting day around here,'' said <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>. `` It's not every day you arrest two people just on a wrong number.''

 Two dozen Western nations that are coordinating a massive aid package for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Wednesday offered similar help to other East European nations moving toward democracy and market economies. The foreign ministers of the 24 nations, ending a one-day meeting, said they would `` respond positively'' to those nations shedding communism. `` The 24 would welcome requests -LRB- for aid -RRB- from other states,'' the ministers said. They mentioned <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. The donor countries _ including the 12 <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> nations, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ `` stressed the importance of the economic and political reform process'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But they did not overtly offer aid to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Sources said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> may need more aid than any other East European nation, but it would have been diplomatically unwise to put it on the list of would-be recipient nations. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told the meeting `` we can not ignore'' democratic reforms elsewhere in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. These showed `` our efforts at coordinating Western responses are addressing only the first phase of the challenge of economic and political reform in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said. Western aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is being coordinated by the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> at the request of the leaders of the seven most industrialized nations, who met in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in July well before the reform movements in other East European nations began to take root. To date, officials said, aid totaling up to $ 6 billion over several years has been granted or committed to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. It ranges from emergency food to long-term export and investment credits. On Wednesday, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and nine other countries formally underwrote a stabilization fund of $ 1 billion to prop up the zloty, the Polish currency, and help make it convertible. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will pay $ 250 million to the fund, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> $ 200 million and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> $ 150 million. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> will each contribute $ 100 million and the remainder will come from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> called the fund `` critical for the success of the currency and price reforms'' in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` The fund is also taking on symbolic importance for the Poles, an indicator of whether the West will in fact stand with them when they make hard economic decisions,'' he added. He said in addition to paying into the stabilization fund, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is granting <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> another $ 800 million in a range of programs including investment credits, food and medical aid and trade guarantees. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has a foreign debt of $ 40 billion. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s is half that, yet it is the highest per capita in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The 24 donor nations also discussed a $ 1 billion loan to help improve the Hungarian economy. Some are considering creating a development bank for <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The Hungarian loan will be made once <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> accepts <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> conditions to overhaul its economy which would also free funds from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and other western sources. Both <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> are near an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> Managing Director <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> said Monday a letter of intent for a $ 700 million loan agreement with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> could be initialed this week. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will put $ 200 million toward a $ 500 million temporary loan for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as it awaits help from the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, the White House said. Polish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, his Hungarian counterpart outlined to the western donors their economic reforms. `` One of our most important aims is to shape a healthy ... enterprise structure,'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. `` Our top priority is to maintain the country's credit-worthiness and to assure access to normal market financial resources that enable us to fulfill our far-reaching political and economic objectives.'' <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON> outlined his country's efforts to `` demonopolize'' the Polish economy `` by opening wider the doors to free enterprise.''

 A gang armed with guns and bombs attacked a security post on the Irish border Wednesday, killing two British soldiers and seriously injuring a third, police said. The attackers escaped unhurt after the attack at <LOCATION> Derryard </LOCATION>, an isolated checkpoint about two miles from the Fermanagh border with <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monaghan </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> said.

 <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> the dog and <PERSON> Whitehill </PERSON> the cat, seized last week in a dispute over back rent, were back home Wednesday, freed by a judge who decreed they were being held hostage _ sort of. `` The nightmare is over!'' 31-year-old <PERSON> Lynell </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelenka </PERSON> said as she hugged <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Whitehill </PERSON>. Civil Court Judge Thomas Early on Tuesday ordered the release of <PERSON> Zelenka </PERSON>'s 7-year-old <PERSON> Saluki </PERSON> and 11-year-old mixed-breed cat, which were seized Dec. 6 along with her car as security for the overdue rent. Her landlord, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, says <PERSON> Zelenka </PERSON> owes him $ 12,000, which he agreed to let slide while she sued over a back injury. Chambers claims she recently settled the lawsuit and did n't tell him. But <PERSON> Zelenka </PERSON>, who admits owing Chambers $ 6,000, ended up with only $ 750 after paying legal fees and medical expenses, Early was told Tuesday. Early said he has n't decided how much rent <PERSON> Zelenka </PERSON> owes, but ruled that <PERSON> Zelenka </PERSON>'s pets have value only to her and, unlike a cow or a horse, would bring no money if put up for sale. The judge said taking <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Whitehill </PERSON> was a form of hostage taking. `` Why should the dog and the cat be pulled into the middle of this thing and deprived of the love of their master?'' he said. Chambers' attorney said he will appeal. Back home at the apartment, <PERSON> Zelenka </PERSON> said the first order of business was a bath for <PERSON> Iris </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Former Comany Chairman Denies Bribery Charges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The former chairman of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest company told a court Wednesday he was engaging in a normal Japanese business deal, not being bribed, when he accepted discount-priced stocks from a firm accused of buying favors. The trial of <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON>, 79, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which began Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, is the fourth of five scheduled trials in the Recruit bribery scandal. Defendants in the fifth trial, to begin Friday, are <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, founder and former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> information services conglomerate, and two politicians accused of accepting bribes. A total of 12 defendants are charged with bribery and could face five years in prison each if convicted. <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>'s company allegedly tried to win favors and influence in the top ranks of politics, business and the bureaucracy. The Recruit scandal and trials have raised many questions about political gift-giving, business practices and the close ties between government and business in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> gave final approval Wednesday to legislation providing punishment for politicians who make donations at weddings, funerals and other events in their election districts without attending the event. Politicials have said constituents expect such donations. Under the new law, which takes effect Feb. 1, violators can be sentenced to a year in prison or fined up to 200,000 yen -LRB- $ 1,390 -RRB-. Shinto, who testified before Judge <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Toyoda </PERSON> in the no-jury trial, accepted the prosecution's factual allegations that he made about 21 million yen -LRB- $ 145,000 -RRB- in 1986 by buying shares in a Recruit subsidiary at a below-market price before they were offered to the public. `` I accepted the offer of shares, but I never regarded it as a bribe,'' Shinto said. He added that, during his business career, other companies had offered him similar shares as a sign of trust and longterm ties. `` Rejecting such an offer is considered rude in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' he said. Shinto denied doing special favors for Recruit. The prosecution alleged that Recruit got favorable terms on telephone lines, maintenance and other services. `` The telecommunications market has become a free market and <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> is a private company,'' Shinto said. `` I ordered all my employees to increase our services to our clients, and I believe they did just that.'' Prosecutors also say Shinto helped Recruit obtain two U.S.-made supercomputers and gave it special assistance. Recruit bought the supercomputers from Shinto's company in 1987 and 1988 after <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> bought them from <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We were never asked by Recruit to buy supercomputers from <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION>, but rather it was done by <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> independently to correct the trade imbalance between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> asked Recruit to buy them from us,'' Shinto said. Japanese business circles were stunned by Shinto's arrest in March. He had a reputation for clean dealings and had seen his giant company through the change in 1985 from government to private ownership. He resigned last December, immediately after his involvement in the stock deal was disclosed. The Recruit scandal began in the summer of 1988 and caused the downfall of Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who resigned last spring after acknowledging he received large donations from Recruit. Other key figures in the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also have been sidelined by the scandal and the honesty of ranking bureaucrats also has been questioned because of gifts they accepted from Recruit.

 A famed composer told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that the new <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> party chief is an opponent of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform and urged him to quit. <PERSON> Rodion </PERSON> <PERSON> Shchedrin </PERSON> took the floor on the second day of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies to criticize a widely publicized meeting in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s second city last month that many Soviets believe showed <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> party leader <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidaspov </PERSON> to be a conservative opponent to the president. `` I am of the opinion that the meeting was aimed at halting the revolutionary processes of perestroika in the country, and there were plenty of threats hidden by fig leaves of eulogisms addressed against our leader and his supporters,'' <PERSON> Shchedrin </PERSON> said. `` I think that your post is incompatible with what you have done,'' he said, addressing <PERSON> Gidaspov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gidaspov </PERSON> was chosen <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> party leader this year to replace <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solovyev </PERSON>, who was embarrassed in elections to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in March. <PERSON> Solovyev </PERSON> had no opposition but still lost because he received less than 50 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Gidaspov </PERSON> made an innocuous speech at the outdoor meeting, which was shown on <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> TV and later on a nationwide news program, saying mainly that it was time to stop talking about reform and start acting. However, other speakers and some of the banners at the rally gave Soviets a different picture. Some speakers sharply attacked cooperatives, the small privately held businesses that are an important feature of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reform. Banners called for top <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials to be brought to account for the country's difficult political and economic situation. <PERSON> Gidaspov </PERSON> denied he was leading the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> party organization toward opposing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. `` To make such statements before the high assembly that are based only on personal impressions seems to me not reasonable,'' he said. `` We consider the work of the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> party and public organizations as work aimed at speeding up perestroika,'' he said. <PERSON> Gidaspov </PERSON> had come in for more heat about the outdoor meeting at a `` countermeeting'' of 40,000 rank-and-file <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> Communists last week. When he tried to make a conciliatory speech to that meeting, he was drowned out by shouts of `` Resign! Resign!''

<HEAD>North Says He Doesn't Want to be Government Witness</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> said Wednesday that he does not want to be a government witness in the Iran-Contra case against his former boss, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> was `` the only one ... who did n't hang <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> out to dry'' during the congressional Iran-Contra hearings, <PERSON> North </PERSON> said at a pre-trial hearing in the case against the former national security adviser. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> is charged with conspiracy, two counts of obstructing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and two counts of making false statements in the Iran-Contra affair. North, in seven hours of testimony over two days, said his perceptions of the Iran-Contra affair had been influenced by <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> testimony, given under a grant of immunity. If <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> agrees, <PERSON> North </PERSON> could be barred from testifying. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> pressed the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide to provide specifics on how <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s testimony tainted his perceptions. `` I'm telling you I ca n't,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said, making it clear he would prefer not to testify at <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s trial, scheduled to begin Jan. 22. `` I hoped I would never set foot in a courtroom ever again,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said when asked why he had n't reviewed his trial testimony in more detail before coming to court this week. `` This is the fourth Christmas that my family has had its door darkened'' by the independent counsel's investigation and prosecution of the Iran-Contra affair, <PERSON> North </PERSON> said. The former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel was convicted in May of three felonies in connection with the arms-for-hostages deal. He is appealing that conviction. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` is not a friendly witness, not to the independent counsel. He may be -LRB- friendly -RRB- to the defense, but we do n't know that either.'' <PERSON> Beckler </PERSON> will file court papers specifying instances in which North gave different testimony or more detailed testimony at his April trial compared with his 1987 congressional testimony. North's congressional appearance preceded <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s nationally televised testimony Questioning North closely, <PERSON> Beckler </PERSON> did bring out that his recollection was affected by <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s testimony in connection with <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> tearing up a politically embarrassing policy statement that depicted the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> initiative as a straight arms-for-hostages deal. <PERSON> North </PERSON> said his memory of the event was colored by the fact that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> acknowledged in his congressional testimony that he had destroyed the presidential document, known as a `` finding,'' Nov. 20, 1986, amid public scrutiny of the administration's arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The presidential finding `` could have been any sheet of paper but for the fact that'' <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> `` confirmed it'' in his congressional testimony, <PERSON> North </PERSON> told <PERSON> Beckler </PERSON>. `` I do n't know for a fact ... that the document destroyed that morning was the finding,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said later when questioned by prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromwich </PERSON>. North testified at his own trial that he watched <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> rip up the document as then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> began focusing on a November 1985 CIA-assisted shipment of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, however, <PERSON> North </PERSON> said that he had n't actually read the document when <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> destroyed it. The destruction of the finding relates to four of the criminal charges against <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, accused of falsely telling <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he did n't learn of the missile shipment to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> until January 1986. The finding, signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in December 1985, was drafted because of the CIA-assisted shipment the previous month.

 Police raided the hideout of a self-proclaimed Moslem saint whose followers captured one of their colleagues, and at least 27 people died in the ensuing gunbattle Wednesday, officials said. The captive officer and three other policemen were among those killed in the fight that began late Tuesday in <LOCATION> Pakundia </LOCATION> village. It ended at dawn Wednesday with the arrest of <PERSON> Matiur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, a former army major who now calls himself a Pir or saint, police officials said. Twenty other people were wounded, said the officials in <LOCATION> Pakundia </LOCATION>, about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kishoreganj </LOCATION> district. They said the raid was ordered to free the policeman held captive by <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>'s supporters in the hideout, located in a sprawling building complex. The policeman had gone to the hideout Monday to investigate reports of `` anti-social activities by the <PERSON> Pir </PERSON>'s followers,'' an official said. He did not say what the anti-social activities were but it was believed to be a reference to gambling and selling drugs. <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>'s 16 disciples also were arrested and 30 others surrendered after the raid by about 700 policemen, they said. Earlier, at least 12 people were reported killed, but a search team found 15 more bodies inside the hideout Wednesday, the officials said. Self-proclaimed Pirs, who profess to cure physical ailments and prescribe ways to becoming rich, abound in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, a nation of 110 million people. About 88 percent of them are Moslems. President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, a former army general, is a follower of a popular god <PERSON> Hashmatullah </PERSON>, who claims to have thousands of disciples. Hashmataullah is based at <LOCATION> Atroshi </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Faridpur </LOCATION> district, 40 miles west of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. Also Wednesday, about 2,000 journalists across <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> went on a 16-hour strike to protest a government ban on a daily newspaper that supported anti-government strikes, the journalists' union said The ban on the Bengali-language <ORGANIZATION> Dainik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Millat </ORGANIZATION>, which has a circulation of 10,000, was imposed Tuesday. The government says frequent opposition-sponsored general strikes are crippling the economy, and estimates the loss at about $ 78 million for a day's work stoppage. Opposition parties demand <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s resignation, accusing his administration of being corrupt and autocratic. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, 59, has refused to step down and maintains he is willing to hold elections without handing over power to a caretaker government. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> took power in a bloodless coup in 1982. He resigned from the army in 1985 and a year later was elected to a five-year presidential term in national balloting that political opponents and foreign observers said was tainted by widespread fraud.

 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said Wednesday he was `` fully in line'' with new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals for reshaping the Western alliance in an era of a reduced security threat from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> advanced the political proposals Tuesday in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> spoke with reporters on the eve of a key meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. He said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers will discuss at their year-end meeting Thursday and Friday the political and economic changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, particularly in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said he strongly supported <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s call for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to set up an arms control verification staff, which would help Western nations monitor compliance with future disarmament accords. `` We can not and will not ignore that the historic change we see all around us will have an impact on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> itself,'' he said. The alliance `` must continue to provide security and stability in a time of turbulence and ... must also be increasingly an instrument that can shape political change,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> chief added. He said the ministers will be trying to encourage the reforms under way in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> as part of efforts to fashion `` a new architecture of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which will allow the division of our Continent to be peacefully overcome.'' The meeting will cap weeks of high-level talks among the 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with other alliance leaders last week to brief them on his <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> discussions with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The alliance nations have been discussing ways to make sure <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> keeps pace with the changes in the East. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> have talked about a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and a New Atlanticism. In his <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> speech, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s political role should be enhanced as its military work diminishes. He said an agreement between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the Soviet-led <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact to reduce the buildup of conventional, or non-nuclear, weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was `` the keystone of this new security structure.'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> was determined to wrap up a conventional arms treaty with the seven <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> nations next year. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been pressing for an agreement by June. Questions rose about the pace of the negotiations because of Greek opposition to a compromise plan to exclude a <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> port from the area covered by the treaty. The snag has held up <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plans to quickly put on the negotiating table in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> a draft treaty for bargaining with the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said work was continuing to reach a timely accord despite the delay. He said the ministers `` will give further impetus'' at their meeting to negotiations on the conventional armed forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> are collaborating on a list of Palestinians who could be sent to preliminary peace talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> legislator said Wednesday. <PERSON> Aryeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliav </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, made the comment after returning from a meeting in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The officials included <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaat </PERSON>, a top political aide to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Eliav </PERSON> said the intensive efforts in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> are aimed at submitting Palestinian names for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> approval in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next month as a step toward the first direct formal negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. The Labor legislator is the first <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official to confirm a report by the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday saying behind-the-scenes peace contacts were under way, despite <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s insistence that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> be excluded from the process <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a terrorist group and officially refuses to hold talks with its members. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, a spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, has denied Sunday's newspaper report. He also said Israeli Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Eliakim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> would go to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week to seek written <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> guarantees that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> be excluded from peace efforts. However, <PERSON> Eliav </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> were already at work drawing up lists of names to present to the Israeli and Egyptian foreign ministers when they meet in January with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meeting called by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, for which no definite date has been set, is supposed to set the stage for Israeli-Palestinian talks in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> about an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> proposal to hold elections in the occupied territories. `` There are some very, very intensive efforts under way in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> involving <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the Americans _ as advisers _ and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, to comprise a delegation that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> can accept,'' <PERSON> Eliav </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s denial of even indirect talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is false, <PERSON> Eliav </PERSON> added. `` Whoever thinks they are not partners, that they are not involved in the process, is living in a fool's paradise, like <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> in Wonderland,'' he said. <PERSON> Eliav </PERSON> said he met <PERSON> Shaat </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> ambassador in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamal </PERSON>, during a two-day symposium on the Israeli-Palestinian dispute sponsored by the Egyptian newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahram </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was ready to `` be flexible'' about <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> demands, <PERSON> Eliav </PERSON> said. `` I have the impression they understand they can not allow themselves the luxury of selecting only the people they want, and that they are putting together a list <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will find difficult to oppose. People in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> know they must not miss this boat,'' <PERSON> Eliav </PERSON> added. He refused to provide names of prospective <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> negotiators. The Israeli peace plan, introduced in April, calls for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to elect representatives to negotiate interim self-rule. The final status of the territories would be negotiated later. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has balked at accepting the plan because it does not guarantee the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> independent statehood. <PERSON> Eliav </PERSON> declined to elaborate on his talks with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials amid radio reports he could be questioned on suspicion of violating a law that bars Israelis from meeting with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> members. The lawmaker said he had stayed within the bounds of the 1986 anti-terrorist law because the meetings were held during a public conference.

<HEAD>Surprise: White House Chief of Staff Lauds Administration</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> confessed to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has made a lot of mistakes, some of them unreported `` doozies.'' Thus ended his confession. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> not only refused to shed light on the flubs, but devoted most of an hour to a glowing review of the administration, five weeks shy of its first birthday, that left practically no superlative unsaid. He called <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` probably the most underrated man in modern history to serve in the presidency.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, who said his aim was to influence the journalists' year-end analyses, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is getting raves, too, in polls that show his approval ratings in the mid-to-high 70s, `` numbers that truly are virtually unprecedented in history. From the savings and loan bailout to the war on drugs, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has set the agenda and shown an ability to work with the Democrat-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> without sacrificing his principles, the former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> governor argued. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has `` really excelled'' in shaping and encouraging the dramatic changes toward democracy in the Soviet bloc, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. `` It was not an easy year. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> just made it seem easy,'' said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has resisted the temptation to make `` instant'' foreign policy or `` snap conclusions.'' `` The one thing the president understands is that you do n't get extra credit for running out and doing it immediately on television,'' he said. He has handled the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc changes `` as one would handle landing a 10-pound fish on 2-pound line,'' avoiding the temptation `` to jerk that line and to try to pull the fish in all at once.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> also hailed his boss as `` the master of the small gesture,'' from inviting <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to his <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, seaside home to taking <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> out to a baseball game to his `` countless hours on the telephone'' with foreign leaders. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> even suggested that the lunch <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held on his July visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for both communist leaders and Solidarity members laid the groundwork for the new Solidarity-led government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. That in turn, he said, `` served as the catalyst for the very rapid change taking place in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Under questioning, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> defended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s controversial decision to send two top aides to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last Saturday to rekindle ties with that communist government, six months after a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recognizes that `` there's a billion people there,'' and he wanted `` to recreate a relationship that would allow whatever pressures we put on to be taken -LRB- as -RRB- credible,'' said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. Asked about the possibility of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will be the first to help, and the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies will await evidence of internal changes before putting together any aid package like the one crafted for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The administration has seldom seen internal quarrels spill out into the press, and <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> was asked how the White House managed that, a rare achievement in recent administrations. `` It has a calm, low-keyed mild-mannered chief of staff who does n't get upset at anything,'' said the imperious <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, evoking laughter _ loudest from his own aides. Any regrets? `` We've made a lot of mistakes. A couple of them you've caught. Most of them you have n't. ... There have been some doozies that you missed.'' Mmmmm. How about an example? His lips are sealed, and he added, `` I'm not even going to write a book.''

<HEAD>German, Crimean Tatars to Get Own Soviet Regions _ Eventually</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has decided to give ethnic Germans and Crimean Tatars who were expelled from their homelands by <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> their own autonomous regions but it will take years, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. `` The ice has been broken. A start has been made. We're working on creating such autonomy,'' said <PERSON> Rafik </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishanov </PERSON>, chairman of a chamber of the Soviet legislature, in remarks carried by the official news agency. However, he said, the nuts and bolts of how to create the regions still had to be worked out. `` For example, a 10-year program on resettlement. People ca n't just be expelled from the area for others to move in.'' The Tatars of the <LOCATION> Crimea </LOCATION> and the ethnic Germans who lived on the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> were forcibly resettled during World War II, when <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> kicked peoples out of their homelands on the grounds they could not be trusted to occupy strategic areas. The Tatars and Germans, among others, long have been agitating to return from <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> to their traditional lands, and last month the Supreme Soviet legislature declared that all peoples exiled under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> should be considered politically rehabilitated. But other people now occupy the lands and houses that belonged to the exiles, and re-establishing their dominion in their home regions will not be so simple. The Supreme Soviet took the basic decision that the two autonmous regions should be created on Nov. 28 but kept it quiet, apparently fearing explosive reactions from the populations now living in the regions. It was also a potentially dangerous precedent: The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is a patchwork of well over 100 ethnic groups, and many of them have outstanding territorial claims. Trouble already has been reported between ethnic Germans and Russians in several cities on the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION>. Residents of the <LOCATION> Saratov </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Volgograd </LOCATION> regions have protested the prospect of seeing many of the nation's estimated 2 million Germans descending on them. Ethnographers estimate there are some 500,000 Crimean Tatars in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and another 1 million in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Their protests near the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> in 1987 demanding to be allowed to return to their homeland were among the first tests of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s promises of greater democracy. Several thousand Tatars have been filtering back to the <LOCATION> Crimea </LOCATION> each year despite the lack of wholesale permission to return. A wave of some 100,000 ethnic Germans emigrated to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this year, but many would probably stay if they could be assured of their own republic, said <PERSON> Irina </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostroukh </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethnography </ORGANIZATION> who studies ethnic Germans. The Nov. 28 plan approved by the Supreme Soviet recommended excluding from the German region areas where resistance to German resettlement was strongest in order to avoid ethnic conflicts. The explosive conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region has led to 200 deaths and hundreds of thousands of refugees in the last two years. Both sides claim control over the mountainous enclave. The Supreme Soviet charged the government with creating a commmission to determine how to create the regions for the Germans and Crimean Tatars.

<HEAD>Biden Urges $1 Billion to Develop Anti-Narcotics Medications</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> called Wednesday for a $ 1 billion drive to develop anti-narcotics medications, saying the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration neglected that weapon in its war on drugs. `` Like AIDS, drug abuse is a national health emergency that threatens thousands of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lives and damages the fabric of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society,'' Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., told a news conference `` While no one expects to find a magic pill that eliminates drug addiction, expert researchers agree that we could be doing more _ a lot more _ to develop new treatments,'' he said. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said the nation should set goals of making a cocaine-blocking medicine available by 1997 and providing `` pharmacotherapeutic treatment-on-demand'' for heroin and cocaine addicts by the year 2000. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said he would introduce legislation that would launch a $ 1 billion medications development program over the next decade, provide drug companies with incentives to develop new treatments, streamline government safety evaluations, call on the surgeon general for a report on the issue and designate top priority research areas. These top priority areas would include the use of `` pharmacotherapeutic'' agents on pregnant women and their fetuses, treatments for new drugs that will appear in the 1990s and interaction between heroin and cocaine addiction. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> unveiled a report from the committee staff that pinpointed eight new medicines that might be used to treat addiction. Some reduce drug craving, while others merely substitute one addiction for another. One actually blocks the pleasure addicts feel as a result of taking their drug. The report said slow <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> procedures combined with pharmaceutical industry inaction and insufficient action by the administration to limit resources devoted to searching for new treatments.

<TEXT>
 Long-feuding neighbors <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> have agreed to build roads linking the two nations, share television programs, and cooperate on farm and industrial projects, news reports said Wednesday. Broad agreement was reached on most of the projects during an October summit between President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s government-owned news media reported Wednesday that the two leaders reaffirmed the decisions Tuesday during <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s one-day visit to <LOCATION> Sirte </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s north coast <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> had been bitter enemies since <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>, shunned efforts by <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> to unify their countries in 1972 Rapprochement between the North African neighbors began in May at an Arab League summit in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. Relations have improved quickly since then, and Tuesday's meeting was the fourth summit between <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. The only document they reportedly signed Tuesday provides that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> supply technical expertise for Libyan industry. News reports initially said the two leaders agreed that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> join in an Arab-European dialogue in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Dec. 21-22 and coordinate its positions with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. But the early editions of Thursday newspapers in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> later quoted the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader as saying the issue was still under discussion by Libyan officials. French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> called for the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> meeting to allow the foreign ministers of the 22 <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> members and the 12 member states of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> to focus on <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> problems. As reported by the government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, other Libyan-Egyptian projects include Egyptian help for desert reclamation projects in southeastern <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and construction of an 80-mile road connecting <LOCATION> Siwa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oasis </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s western desert with the <ORGANIZATION> Jaghbub </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oasis </ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s friends and parents expressed gratitude and relief Wednesday at the news that the church worker was being released from the Salvadoran prison where she'd been held on terrorism charges. `` I am deeply, greatly grateful to each and every one who has believed in <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> and her innocence,'' her mother, <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, told a news conference in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'s Whethersfield office just south of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, 28, was arrested Nov. 26 after a raid on her house in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, and was accused of storing weapons for leftist rebels. Police said they found thousands of rounds of Soviet-made ammunition and other armaments in the garden behind her home. Salvadoran President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Christiani </PERSON> announced Wednesday that <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, 28, had been released because of insufficient evidence and would be deported. Shortly afterwards, reporters saw the <LOCATION> Thomaston </LOCATION> native leave <LOCATION> Ilopango </LOCATION> prison with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. `` You do n't know whether to laugh because you're happy or cry because you're happy,'' said <PERSON> Susanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminar </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, the lay church group that sent <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> to the Central American country in 1985. `` We hope this helps stop the persecution of church workers that's going on in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said, weeping as she spoke. `` This confirms our standing all along of her innocence.'' In <LOCATION> Whethersfield </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, thanked volunteers and officials `` for bringing our daughter home.'' In <LOCATION> Thomaston </LOCATION>, a western <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> town of 7,000 people, the initial shock and disbelief over Casolo's arrest 2 -LCB- weeks ago was replaced by an effort to win her freedom. A hastily arranged prayer vigil drew 250 people and raised $ 1,000, teachers started a legal defense fund and other organized a letter - and Christmas card-writing drive Word of <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s release spread quickly at <LOCATION> Thomaston </LOCATION> High School, where <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> was student body president 10 years ago. `` All the faculty here are extremely elated that she'll be coming back home to us,'' said teacher <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` Word got around very very quickly, from room to room to room.'' A decade ago, <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> was a cheerful, popular high school senior more interested in cheering on the basketball team than changing the world. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, who came from a working class-family, finished at the top of her class, and honors came easily to her. In addition to being chosen student body president, she was the yearbook editor and was voted most ambitious, most creative and `` did the most for <ORGANIZATION> Thomaston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` She was the hit of the school,'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, now a vice principal at the school, said Tuesday. `` She was very intelligent, inquisitive, a bundle of energy. If anything needed to be started for school spirit or something, she would always do it.'' Friends described her as a compassionate, caring teen-ager, but said there was little sign of the spirituality Casolo would find working among El Salvador's poor. Her parents divorced while she was a student. Her mother supported the family by working as a bookkeeper at a vocational high school in <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION>. Friends say <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> became more religious and more interested in social work while at <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a prestigious liberal arts college in <LOCATION> Waltham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. She took a double major in American studies and Latin American studies, was captain of the soccer team and graduated summa cum laude. Friends say <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> experienced anxiety about choosing a career, torn between an attraction to social work and a feeling of obligation to find a well-paying job to help her mother. Social work won out. After working with Salvadoran refugees in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, Casolo, who is fluent in Spanish, left for <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. She worked for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminars </ORGANIZATION>, which organizes visits for prominent Americans to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` I think that she was something she felt called to do rather than simply take a job and make a lot of money,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, a close friend from high school. The work put her in close contact with a wide range of Salvadorans, from President <PERSON> Christiani </PERSON> and military leaders to church leaders and opposition party politicians. Casolo quickly formed a spiritual attachment to the country and its people, particularly the poor. In a letter to a friend, she spoke of joining the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to become a nun. In another letter, she wrote, `` I'm a pastor without religion. Only with lots of love.'' Even after her arrest, <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> remained upbeat, shouting her claims of innocence to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reporters at her arraignment and describing her imprisonment as a `` life-changing experience.'' `` I ca n't say I have faith in the system to find me innocent,'' she said. `` But I believe my innocence will shine through.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, whose complaint led to the congressional investigation of Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, asked the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday to widen its probe to include a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grant and <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> phone calls to a federal prosecutor. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, a Democrat who lost the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race to <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, in 1986, also said potential witnesses in the investigation should be subpoenaed to testify under oath. `` There are a lot of people with information who will be scared to speak out against <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, given his reputation for ruthlessness, unless the committee puts them under oath, which in a sense protects them,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said in an interview. He also said <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> should be put under oath. <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said later he would testify before the committee `` in any way in which they request. And I'm delighted to make myself available and to cooperate with them in every way and any way.'' At a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> news conference on another issue, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said he was unaware of <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s latest move, `` but it would n't surprise whatever it is, and I'm delighted that we'll have an opportunity to have all of Mr. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s charges reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said he was confident he would be exonerated. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, who currently runs the Democracy Project, a liberal research organization in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he filed the additional papers because the committee's special counsel, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuelke </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, asked him for `` any new information, insights.'' The phone calls <PERSON> Green </PERSON> referred to were made by <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> to then-U.S. Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> in 1984 and 1985. On one occasion, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> passed along a plea from the Rev. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gigante </PERSON> for a reduction in the sentence of his brother, <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Gigante </PERSON>, a convicted loan shark who also has been reported to be an officer in the Genovese crime family. <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> has said he was merely trying to help the priest, a constituent. In the other call, made at the behest of the late criminal lawyer <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> to review murder charges against an unnamed defendant. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> has said he later concluded <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> was referring to <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellano </PERSON>, then boss of the Gambino crime family. <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> has said he was unaware of the identity of the defendant in the latter case and that he was trying to save <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s office from being embarrassed if the charges did n't stick. The <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grant was $ 500,000 from a discretionary fund controlled by then-Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. The money was awarded to a coalition of black ministers, including the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> was to use the money to rehabilitate a building into a drug treatment center. The grant came one month after the group endorsed <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> for re-election in 1986. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, who is under indictment accused of stealing $ 250,000 from his organization, has said, `` If we had n't endorsed <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, I do n't think -LRB- Bishop <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> -RRB- would have had access to <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> and any funding.'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Zenia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mucha </PERSON> has said that the senator did not know of <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>'s role in the project. After <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> died last January, the project was dropped. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> filed his original complaint against <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> last July, and followed up with an addendum in September. He has charged that <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> misused his influence to steer federal favors to political contributors and friends.

 Companies that build planes, spacecraft and related equipment have too few skilled workers, as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> schools lag behind in science and math, an industry study concluded Wednesday. A survey of companies belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> showed 67 percent of the companies suffer from a shortage of scientists and engineers and 55 percent report a shortage of production workers. More than 80 percent said they expect more shortages in the future. The problem is made more serious by rapid changes in the technology needed in aerospace industries, by a lack of young people preparing for jobs with a technological focus, by the failure of women and minorities to choose such careers and by the fact that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students generally are doing poorly in science and math, said the <ORGANIZATION> AIA </ORGANIZATION> study. The survey was compiled from responses of 30 major corporations, including nine of the top 10 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contractors and eight of the top 10 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> contractors. Key shortages are occurring in jobs that involve computers, advanced materials, electro-optics and artificial intelligence, the study said. Among concerns raised by aerospace companies are that employees have insufficient hands-on experience, that schools put too much emphasis on theoretical models, that there is a lack of emphasis on design projects in college, and that people with advanced degrees are academically oriented and have to adjust to the faster pace of industry. Some companies also complained of deficiences in verbal and team-building skills among high-level professionals. Aerospace companies are responding to the problem by giving almost 40 percent of their total corporate contributions to education up to the high school level, with large amounts going to colleges and universities for research and development projects, the report said. A November report by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION> concluded that the nation faces a crisis in science education, with schools producing an inadequate number of science and engineering graduates.

 Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said Wednesday he will investigate a political campaign battle between government opponents and supporters this week that left one person dead and more than 20 injured. `` We hope to determine the causes of this violence,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> arrived at the head of a delegation of observers, invited by both the leftist Sandinista government and the opposition, to monitor the process leading to national elections Feb. 25. It was his second trip here this year. Sandinistas and leaders of the National Opposition Union accused each other of inciting the Dec. 10 riot in <LOCATION> Masatepe </LOCATION>, 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, in which a Sandinista campaign office and a private home were looted and two vehicles were burned. It was the worst outbreak of violence in the 2-month-old election campaign for president, vice president, a new legislature and municipal authorities nationwide. The Center for Democracy, a Washington-based observer group, blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. A report by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> said the riot was deliberately provoked but that its observers could not determine who was responsible. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he is pleased that so far all sides are intent on having free and fair elections. Accompanying <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was his wife <PERSON> Rosalynn </PERSON>; former Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash.; and former President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oduber </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> For the next three days they will travel throughout <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, talking to <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> observer groups about the electoral process. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he would like to see the money approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels channeled through a commission set up to oversee their demobilization. He stopped short of calling for demobilization of the Contras before the elections, saying, `` My hope is there will be no need for a Contra presence after the elections.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was commenting on this week's summit by five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents that called for disbanding the Contras and leftist Salvadoran guerrillas. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and Contra leaders want the Contras to remain in place as a fighting force until after the elections to make sure President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> keeps his promise the electoral process will be open and fair. The five presidents agreed Aug. 7 in <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, to call for demobilization of the Contras by Dec. 5 in exchange for <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s promise of electoral fairness But Contra leaders ignored the deadline and Central American leaders passed it by after violence re-escalated in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvavador </LOCATION> 10-year-old civil war.

<TEXT>
 The White House on Wednesday denied any association between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s brother, who has business dealings in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consideration of easing a satellite trade ban against <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The president and <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, who visited <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last February on business, are `` unaware of any association involving <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> aircraft,'' the contractor that is building three satellites for launch by the Chinese, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is considering lifting a ban on satellite exports to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a sanction he imposed because of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s violent crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators last spring. Affected would be three communications satellites that are being manufactured by <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> and are to be launched in joint ventures by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Administration officials have said the ban on satellite export might be lifted because <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> meant to restrict military trade, not commercial ventures. The president's brother is a business consultant to <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Settlement of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, an international merchant bank that arranges financing and other services for firms doing multinational business. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheinman </PERSON>, executive vice president of the firm, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision on the satellite matter `` is not relevant to our business plans.'' The president's brother did not return a reporter's Wednesday calls to his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Scheinman </PERSON> said it was `` pretty far out'' to suggest that a decision to resume the satellite transfers would benefit <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or the Asset Management firm. However, he acknowledged that `` future telecommunications capacity established anywhere in the world'' to technology starved countries like the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` would benefit any telecommunications interest,'' such as a client Asset Management is working with. That company, <ORGANIZATION> Sino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, is involved in a venture with a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> group to link data bases that are scattered all over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Scheinman </PERSON> contended the firm already has its plans for a communications network using all existing telecommunications avenues, including telephone lines, microwave, and an existing satellite. Thus, said <PERSON> Scheinman </PERSON>, Sino Trade is not concerned about whether more satellites are brought in. However, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday quoted an official of <ORGANIZATION> Sino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as saying that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision on the Hughes satellites could augment Sino Trade's project although the company would not be dependent on it. The official, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> satellites would offer a better communications link than the domestic one in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said the president's brother `` has been very careful in his dealings. ... He is cognizant of his brother's position and has been, in the past, outspoken that there is no relationship in his business dealings with those of the government or the president.'' <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> traveled through <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in search of business for his own development consulting firm last February. The president also visited those same countries later. The president's brother said at the time he saw no conflict of interest and stated he has a policy against doing business with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government or lobbying the government.

 Gunner's mate <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday former USS Iowa crew mate <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> was no `` suicidal freak'' and did n't cause the explosion that killed <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> and 46 other sailors. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> accused the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> of using `` a big coverup'' to thwart theories that the shipboard explosion was accidental rather than caused intentionally, `` most likely'' by <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, as the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has concluded. Rep. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on investigations, also has been critical of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s report And at the end of the hearing he told Vice Adm. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnell </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, `` You've pointed your finger when there's that little chance'' that the explosion was accidental `` Would n't you have been better off to say we do n't know?'' the congressman asked. <PERSON> Donnell </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> believes `` we do know'' that <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> most likely caused the explosion. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> was n't told until the morning of April 19 that he was going to be positioned at center gun in the No. 2 gun turret, `` so there would have been no time for planning'' a suicide explosion. He said <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> had once talked of suicide, but <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said he did not take him seriously. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said his own theory is that the blast was caused by a defective hydraulic rammer _ the piece of equipment used to shove the powder bags up against the projectile in the huge gun. He said he had had a problem with a rammer on the left gun in No. 2 gun turret about a year earlier, describing it as behaving like a transmission stuck between neutral and drive. He theorized that the rammer might have `` suddenly taken off,'' putting too much pressure on the propellant. He also maintained that gunpowder on the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> had been stored in high heat, that the cans were not airtight, and that `` you could smell ether'' when entering a powder storage area. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said the fact that the crew mates working closest to the center gun had not gone through the exercise together before `` may have been a contributing factor'' in the explosion. Questioned about his personal relationship with <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said they had a basically strong friendship, with occasional quarrels. Under questioning, he denied they had ever been homosexual lovers. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s official report on the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> accident Sept. 7 made no mention of a possible homosexual link between the two, although there had been earlier news reports that Naval Investigative Agents were pursuing such a theory. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said he thought other <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> crewmen spread rumors about the two because they did n't drink and spent a lot of time with each other. `` I knew it was n't true, and it did n't bother me,'' he said. `` He knew it was n't true. It bothered him.'' Petty Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullahy </PERSON>, who served on the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> beginning last December and was in the same division as <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, said of the two men: `` From the time I was on board, they were n't talking to each other. ... They hated each other.'' Yet, <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> never had <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> removed as the beneficiary on <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s $ 101,000 life insurance policy. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said that in settlement of the policy claim, he gave <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s family $ 2,500, his lawyer $ 40,000, and kept the rest. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> also revealed that he was named as beneficiary on a life insurance policy taken out by another sailor friend who is assigned to the USS Roosevelt. He said he saw nothing particularly unusual about such arrangements. The gunner's mate sat alone at the witness table in his <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> uniform. His wife of one year sat in the first row of the public seats. He said there would have been no reason for <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> to think he would be in the gun turret on the day of the fatal explosion last April. `` He was off the watch list'' for the gun-firing exercise, <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said. `` He was expecting his -LRB- next -RRB- assignment to be in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.'' The gunner's mate described the last seconds before shipboard blast off the coast of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> was part of the crew engaged in the firing exercise, passing gun powder bags from a storage room to the center gun where the shooting was to take place. He said the overheard last words of Petty Officer <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, who was in center gun position with <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, would have been far different if the explosion had been intentionally caused. `` He would n't have had as his last words, ` I'm not ready yet. We've got a problem in here,''' <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. `` He would have said, ` Hey, excuse me guys, he put a bomb in here.' If <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> was going to blow up the ship, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> would have stopped him. They were literally standing shoulder to shoulder.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has concluded that <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> `` most likely'' caused the explosion by inserting some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in the gun, whose barrel has a 16-inch diameter. But it has acknowledged that the cause of the explosion likely will never be solved beyond a doubt because everyone near the gun was killed. `` <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> did not cause the explosion,'' said <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>. `` I do not think he committed suicide. I believe the report is very misleading.'' `` It's a big coverup, in my opinion,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> was not the suicidal freak they make him out to be.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers have said that while some safety lapses were discovered in the course of the investigation, there was no substantial risk involving the 16-inch guns and the powder used to fire them. The captain of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>, testified earlier in the week he would not have allowed firing to resume six weeks after the accident if he had lingering safety concerns.

 The party that took <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>'s orders for 35 years expelled him Wednesday, and his replacement as leader exhorted Communists to prepare for `` a nationwide exam'' in free elections promised for May The policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also agreed to join other <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> parties in surrendering its constitutional guarantee of supreme power. Members made the decisions in a three-day discussion of reform, while tens of thousands of people stood outside to remind them promises must be kept. <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>, who became party chief when <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> was forced out Nov. 10, said Monday that free elections should be held in May. On Tuesday, he told the Communist leadership: `` We have to ... conquer _ this time in the real sense of the word _ the hearts and minds of the millions of Bulgarians. `` Soon we will face a nationwide exam: free and democratic elections ... and it is there we must show that we are not only worthy of, but also practically capable of, leading'' the country. Some of <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>'s remarks at the closing session of a three-day meeting were carried by <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency. <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> reported the expulsions from the party of <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>; his son, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Milko </PERSON> <PERSON> Balev </PERSON>, a close associate of the former leader. <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, 78, has come under increasing attack for alleged mismanagement and corruption, as well as his dictatorial rule. The news agency said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would propose to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that it remove two constitutional clauses in which the party is given sole power. One defines the party as `` the leading force'' in society and the state, and the other says the party `` heads the construction of an advanced socialist society.'' As the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting drew to a close, a crowd estimated by Western reporters at 60,000 gathered in the plaza outside to show support in a rally sponsored by the party. <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>, who served 18 years as foreign minister under <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, told the crowd: `` Our party does not need a law to guarantee its leading role. It is the people who decide.'' Signs hoisted above the throng said `` A <ORGANIZATION> Bulgarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Untainted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>,'' and `` Together with the <ORGANIZATION> Bulgarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for New Democratic Communist Socialism.'' Nearby, outside the <ORGANIZATION> Alexander </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, about 2,000 people applauded a speaker from the <ORGANIZATION> Agrarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> party who declared: `` Today we end this semi-existence.'' The speaker, not identified, was referring to the subservient role given the <ORGANIZATION> Agrarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the only other legal party the Communists allowed. <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> has moved swiftly to oust <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>'s associates from the ruling party Politburo in favor of people more likely to embrace reform. In a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> said the party should start talks with independent groups immediately and relinquish the guarantee of sole power, as has been done in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. He proposed that free elections be held by May. <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> was removed from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week and his son was kicked out of the committee and all other party posts in November. The former party leader has been accused publicly of living lavishly in a workers' state, in 13 opulent official residences and six hunting lodges. Officials have said the residences and lodges will be turned over to the public. <PERSON> Balev </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>'s private secretary for many years, was ousted from the Politburo soon after the downfall of his boss. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukanov </PERSON>, considered second in the new hierarchy after <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday `` there are full grounds for detailed investigation of the income and expenses'' of <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> and his family, <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Lukanov </PERSON> heads a new party committee on corruption that is investigating `` financial and other violations by ... <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, his family and his closest circle; cases of profiteering; cases of corruption and the abuse of power for personal favors,'' and other allegations, <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said. Many speakers at the Tuesday committee session criticized <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> and said anyone associated with him who remains in power should resign or be dismissed. Politburo member <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilov </PERSON> demanded <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> and close associates be punished and asked how the system could allow `` dictators'' to rule so long. On Sunday, more than 50,000 people demonstrated in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, chanting calls for reform and dialogue between the Communists and opposition. It was the largest pro-democracy display since the Communists consolidated power in 1946.

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> tightened his grip on power Wednesday, reshuffling his <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> on the eve of a meeting by the legislature to discuss naming him chief of state. A foe said this would mean `` the beginning of a fascist dictatorship.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> communique announced the promotion of 49 officers, four of them to the rank of lieutenant colonel, automatically making them members of the general staff. On Thursday, the 510-member legislature dominated by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is to discuss a proposal by his supporters to name him chief of government with powers greater than those of provisional President <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. The so-called Popular Power Assembly was formed by <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and is made up of representatives of mayors and county council chairmen. It replaces the single-house <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> vacated Sept. 1 <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> annulled May 7 elections for a new president, legislature and other offices when returns showed opposition candidates were winning by a landslide. He later named <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, a longtime crony, as provisional president. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> recently was named coordinator of the assembly. As chief of government, he would have total authority over the country, since he will also be retaining his present job of Defense Forces chief. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s job would be reduced to a ceremonial post. `` This would be the beginning of a fascist dictatorship that gives civilian and military power to a single chief,'' <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, head of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Demcoratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s latest move. `` He can name himself emperor. ... We know he is the one who rules and decides everything,'' <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, another opposition leader, said. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> ran as presidential and vice presidential candidates in the May 7 elections annulled by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The general, who survived two coup attempts in as many years, was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in February 1988 on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges. He denies the charges. Since then, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> along with diplomatic pressure have failed to force him out of power. Senior officers attempted coups to overthrow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on March 16, 1988, and on Oct. 3 but failed to remove him. More than 10 people were killed in the last attempt. Among those promoted to lieutenant colonel were Maj. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cedeno </PERSON>, the chief of state security, and police chief Maj. <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Maylin </PERSON>. Among those still under arrest after the October coup are three former members of the general staff _ Col. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, the ex-intelligence chief, Col. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ow </PERSON> <PERSON> Joung </PERSON> and Lt. Col. <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Palacios </PERSON> <PERSON> Gondola </PERSON>.

 Prince <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> of <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said on Wednesday he is worried <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts may get low priority as the western world focuses on the sweeping changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Following his half-hour Oval Office visit with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the prince said that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> backs the East European moves toward political freedom and economic reform, but added: `` As we look at peacemaking in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> region, we hope that the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> does not slip on the international agenda. And that certainly is a concern of many people in our part of the world share.'' `` It's been valuable to speak to the president during this period of world transition and to state our concern and our commitment for lasting peace in our region,'' he said. <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> voiced an optimistic note for the future saying, `` I would expect the new year period would be an interesting one for all concerned in the region.'' The meeting focused on the recent parliamentary elections in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> as well, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Oil Executive Criticizes Foreign Oil Leasing Idea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A prominent oil executive suggested Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> drop consideration of a plan to cut the cost of building <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> emergency oil reserves by leasing, rather than buying, oil from foreign producers. `` I have a little problem with going with hat in hand'' to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> or other foreign producers to, in effect, ask for help in filling the emergency reserve, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Silas </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, told a department hearing. `` If it's a good program, it ought to be funded'' by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayers, he added. <PERSON> Silas </PERSON> said putting leased <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would only add complications in the event of a serious <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dispute with a leasor country. `` It may end up in a confrontation where you'd have to nationalize'' the leased oil, <PERSON> Silas </PERSON> said. The Phillips chairman was responding to questions from Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, who told <PERSON> Silas </PERSON> his department was considering a variety of ways of reducing the cost of filling the oil reserve, which now hold 580 million barrels of oil in a series of underground salt domes in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> indicated his department, in considering the oil reserve question as part of a broader national energy strategy, had not yet decided whether the less costly leasing option would enhance or detract from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> energy security. The department had disclosed earlier this year that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the No. 1 foreign supplier of oil to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, had expressed interest in leasing oil for the emergency reserve, although no specific proposals had been discussed. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told Wednesday's hearing `` many nations of the world are approaching us rather aggressively'' about participating in a leasing program. He did not name any of the countries. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milsten </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Offices </ORGANIZATION>, told <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> his association was concerned about the leasing idea but had not yet formed a firm opinion. The strategic reserve `` might not be seen as a serious defense mechanism'' in an oil supply emergency if part of the stockpile was leased rather than owned by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, <PERSON> Milsten </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Weapons Cache Discovered Next to Red Cross Apartments</HEAD>

 Israeli troops shot and wounded at least 10 Palestinians on Wednesday in clashes throughout the occupied lands, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> journalists and hospital officials said. The army meanwhile reported finding a cache of knives, axes and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> flags outside a building housing <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> relief officials in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. News reports said the weapons were put there by a Palestinian gang. <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> is a center of anti-Israeli unrest. `` Something seemed suspicious about the house, and we went into the yard and underneath some leaves found a knife, and then axes, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> flags and all sorts of equipment,'' said an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television. TV said the weapons apparently belonged to a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> gang who took advantage of immunity the army granted to the apartment grounds used by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. Repeated phone calls to the the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> went unanswered, but an army spokesman said the group denied any connection to the weapons and praised the army's action. The find came as <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> merchants observed the second day of a three-day strike in memory of four <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists slain by troops on Dec. 1, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said. The brother of one of the slain activists was shot and wounded Wednesday as troops searched his <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> home, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. Nine other Palestinians were wounded in clashes around the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmed one Palestinian wounded in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and said the military was investigating the other reports. At least 631 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis during the two-year <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising against Israeli rule. Forty-three Israelis have also died, and Palestinians have killed 155 of their fellow Arabs on suspicion of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities.

<HEAD>Mass Grave of Children Discovered in Northern Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials on Wednesday announced the discovery of a mass grave with the remains of 135 children of North African Jewish immigrants who died in a 1957 epidemic, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television reported. The report came after a day of prayers and accusations by other Jews from <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> peninsula. They feared the grave could hold the bones of about 600 children from their community that were reported missing in the 1950s shortly after their arrival in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The discovery of the mass grave reopened one of the most mysterious chapters in the history of immigration to the Jewish state. There has never been an authoritative explanation of the disappearance of the Yemenite children. One theory is that they were taken to collective farms and lost contact with their parents. Another is they were dispersed to other immigrant camps. However, news reports said the remains in the mass grave were instead those of North African children who died during the epidemic. The unmarked mass grave was discovered last week in a cemetery in <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yona </LOCATION>, a village 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, when gravediggers tried to dig in an unused portion of the cemetery. The find was leaked to the press by a gravedigger who said he feared the children's remains might not be treated properly, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> TV reported. Dozens of Yemenite families flocked to the gravesite Wednesday shortly after its discovery was announced on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. Almost 47,000 Yemenites, nearly the entire Jewish community, were brought to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as part of `` Operation Magic Carpet.'' That program ended in 1950. <PERSON> Yisrael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessar </PERSON>, a legislator from the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a Yemenite immigrant, called on Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to order an investigation into the discovery after it was announced. However, police investigators said the remains were of children of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> immigrants who died in a nearby hospital and were hastily buried in a mass grave without a marker for `` economic reasons,'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. Most of the North Africans were from <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. There was no report of what sickness killed them, but various epidemics swept through Israeli camps in those years, including cholera and tuberculosis. The mass grave is next to the sites of two such camps. <PERSON> Nissim </PERSON> <PERSON> Atiya </PERSON>, a gravedigger who buried the victims in 1957, said the children's families were notified of their deaths, and `` it was all done officially.''

 The deluge of indignities continued for <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, the disgraced former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, when the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> city government decided Wednesday to take back his honorary citizenship.

 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members continued their attack on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to send high-level officials to confer with Chinese leaders, complaining Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> refused to allow one of those officials to come to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to defend the action. `` It seems the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is willing to send Mr. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> 6,000 miles to apologize to the Chinese leaders, but it was not willing to send him two miles to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to explain this action to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>. Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> had been invited to testify about the trip before a hearing convened by two House Foreign Affairs subcommittees <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> made the surprise visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last weekend with <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> could not testify because he was filling in for Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who is in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. However, spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> had briefed several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the mission. Democrats vowed to press early next year for punitive sanctions against the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government in retaliation for its violent crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last June, saying they could prevail even if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoes the bill. <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> was harshly critical of the Eagleburger-Scowcroft visit, contending they apologized `` for being offended by the savage squelching of those who courageously sought basic freedoms in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>.'' Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, defended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I do n't know of a soul who believes that the Scowcroft mission went to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to apologize to the Chinese,'' he said. `` This Congress and this administration have no intention of kowtowing to illegitimate Chinese actions.'' However, <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> said he believes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has an obligation to take whatever steps it can to persude the Chinese lift the `` yoke of political oppression'' The weekend mission, he said, can be seen as a test of the ability of outside parties to `` help extricate a proud nation from an embarassing corner.'' `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is prudentially betting that a historically xenophobic <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is more likely to temper its stridency at home and abroad if it is n't perceived to be capitulating to the pressure of foreign powers,'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> said. As House members wrangled over the issue, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, weighed in on behalf of those who contend <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a serious blunder in sending Scowcroft and <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, in a speech before the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> compounded his blunder when he moved to lift sanctions he had imposed against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by executive order. Those moves, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said, include renewing subsidies for wheat sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, permitting Chinese engineers to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to work on upgrading Chinese fighter planes and a possible lifting of a ban on exporting communications satellites. `` These actions represent an embarrassing eagerness to please the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government and an awkward reluctance to support the aspirations of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` It should be the other way around.''

 Nine women who bared their breasts on a city beach last summer were not covered by the Constitution, a judge ruled Wednesday. <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> City Court Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> refused to dismiss the charges, saying the women violated a state law that prohibits public breast exposure. He also found them guilty and fined them. Defense attorneys argued during a trial this fall that the law is `` a badge of inequality'' and a violation of the 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law. They asked <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> to declare the law unconstitutional and he gave them time to present written arguments before making his ruling. The prosecutor argued that the law is constitutional and conforms to community standards. The women were arrested in June for removing their tops on a <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> beach. Charges were dropped against a 10th because she was nursing her child, which is exempt from the state law. Exposure carries a maximum penalty of 15 days in jail and a $ 250 fine. `` It was very disappointing to have his ruling against us. I see it as a crushing blow against equal rights for women,'' said defendant <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Schloss </PERSON>. Seven women _ then known as the <LOCATION> Topfree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seven </LOCATION> _ were charged with indecent exposure in 1986 after they removed their shirts in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Cobbs </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. Those charges were dismissed by a judge who called it an issue of free speech. Three women who were arrested in both cases were given $ 100 fines Wednesday: <PERSON> Schloss </PERSON>, 41; <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, 43; and <PERSON> Ramona </PERSON> <PERSON> Santorelli </PERSON>, 31, all of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>. Six other defendants were either fined $ 50 or ordered to do community service: <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Nieser </PERSON>, 25; <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, 41; <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, 35; and <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Leibowitz </PERSON>, 21, all of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, along with <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiller </PERSON>, 61, of <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. The women were also given criminal discharges, meaning another arrest for a defendant within a year could reopen the charges against her. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> dismissed charges against <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien-Dovan </PERSON>, 31, who was nursing her child. During sentencing, some of the women said they would continue to go shirtless.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has approved a new <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> correspondent to replace the newsman expelled after the government crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday. The foreign ministry conveyed its approval to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> three days after a high-level <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation returned from a surprise trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The delegation discussed ways to mend the strained ties between the two governments that have existed since hundreds of people were killed in June when the Chinese military advanced on the demonstrators in <LOCATION> Tianamen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. `` We welcome'' the decision to approve <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> <PERSON> Nealer </PERSON>'s accreditation, which has been pending since September, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement <PERSON> Nealer </PERSON> is head of the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and Pacific News department. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Pessin </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> newsman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomfret </PERSON> were expelled from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after being accused of spreading rumors and lies about the military crackdown. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said he did n't know whether the Chinese decision on <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> was related to the weekend talks in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> led by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION>. `` We think this is a positive step,'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said. The next move, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said, is for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to stop jamming the Mandarin and Cantonese language <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, as they have since June. The four-hour English-language broadcasts are not jammed, he said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, criticized by some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the recent overtures to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> while <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities continue to harshly suppress pro-democracy dissidents, has made clear it would welcome any reciprocal gesture from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The first such gesture came when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official news agency announced Monday, the day <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> returned, that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would not sell <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> medium-range M-9 missiles that have been a subject of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern. After <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> returned, the administration revealed it was considering lifting a ban on satellite exports to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused Wednesday to reply when asked if he was prepared to lift the ban, but a spokesman said there had not been a final decision. The Hughes Aircraft-manufactured communications satellites fall in the category of items on the government's sensitive munitions list that were automatically included in a suspension of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> imposed to protest the crackdown. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, a source said the satellite deal would be approved Friday. The source, who has been following the administration's deliberations, spoke on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> called word of the concessions to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> an indication of `` an embarrassing eagerness to please the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government and an awkward reluctance to support the aspirations of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people. It should be the other way around.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said after the June crackdown that there could not be business as usual with any government that would take such action. `` Yet that is exactly what appears to be happening,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. On the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> side, members of the <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> subcommittee harshly criticized the trip to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and lambasted Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> for declining to appear before the panel to report on his talks in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.

White House spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>'s main mission was to speak to two Chinese friends of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, one a mid-level government official and the other a former member of government. <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said, was `` simply to hear their thoughts about the changes going on in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'' since the June demonstrations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> served as liaison officer, then the highest-ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, in 1974-75.

<HEAD>USAir Strips Old DC-9s to Look for Wear</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> is taking apart three of its older planes to search for age-related structural flaws in an around-the-clock effort to get a head start on an expected tightening of aircraft safety standards. `` We're trying to look in places you normally ca n't look at to see what we can do to prevent a problem in the future,'' said <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON>. A task force comprising representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, airlines and aircraft manufacturers began studying the safety of older planes last year in the wake of several age-related accidents. It began its work in October 1988, six months after a section of the fuselage of an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet peeled off over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON>, director of aircraft heavy maintenance for <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspection recommendations are likely to become mandatory in February. <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> accident, which killed a flight attendant and injured dozens of passengers, the catalyst for the closer look at older planes. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> selected three DC-9s, each about 20 years old, for the program. The airline has completed what it calls an inch-by-inch inspection of one DC-9 and returned it to the <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> 400-plane fleet. The second plane in the program is at an airline maintenance hangar at <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s airport. Mechanics are to have it finished within a month. The 22-year-old DC-9, built for <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in 1967 and bought by <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> a decade later, has been stripped of its paint and cabin furnishings. Three shifts of 18 mechanics each work day and night, searching for flaws not readily revealed by more common inspection techniques. The thick smell of primer floats inside the hangar and there is a constant whir of machinery and ping of hammers on rivets. Mostly, the mechanics are looking for evidence of corrosion, which airline officials believe leads to fuselage cracks. Standing over a table beside the 107-foot-long plane, mechanic <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Garman </PERSON> worked Wednesday to replace corroded metal from underneath the aircraft. `` We'll either treat it or we'll replace it, depending on the depth of it,'' <PERSON> Garman </PERSON> said. `` It's kind of like your rusty fender on a car,'' he explained. `` If it's just a little bit of rust, you clean it up and paint it, but if it's real deep, you replace that area.'' Working on a scaffold alongside the plane, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Slack </PERSON> placed a metal reinforcing strip above the plane's windows from front to rear. Tests have shown that area to be more susceptible to stress cracks than other parts of the plane. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> estimates the procedure will cost about $ 1 million per plane. After the first three DC-9s are completed, airline officials will review the program and make any necessary adjustments before continuing. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, the airline's vice president of heavy maintenance, said 29 planes are scheduled to be completed in the next four years. A total of 50 of <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s 74 DC-9s will be stripped and inspected, he said. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said he's not worried that patching up the aircraft might make <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet look less sky-worthy. `` It all in your perspective,'' he said. `` When you see an airplane at the gate that has patches on it, should you be concerned _ or should you be concerned if you see an airplane that does n't have them?''

 On July 18, 1863, despite fatigue and poor rations, the 54th <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Colored Volunteer Infantry marched across a half-mile of sand on a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> beach to lead the ill-planned attack on <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> harbor. The regiment lost more than 40 percent of its men. The story of the 54th, the first black regiment from the North to fight in the Civil War, and its youthful white colonel, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, unfolds in `` Glory,'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Zwick </PERSON>'s masterful movie for Tri-Star Pictures. <PERSON> Zwick </PERSON> presents a powerful, moving tapestry of war's senselessness The screenplay by <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarre </PERSON> is partly based on the books `` Lay This Laurel'' and `` One Gallant Rush,'' and letters <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> wrote home to his parents. The movie _ narrated by <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> as <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> _ is largely seen through his eyes. Young and privileged, but disillusioned and battle-scarred after the gory and indecisive Battle of <LOCATION> Antietam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> returns to his wealthy, powerful and abolitionist parents in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> just in time for a lavish party and an offer from the governor to take command of an all-black fighting regiment. He rises in rank from captain to colonel and musters his men, who include his childhood friends <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Elwes </PERSON> -RRB-, who is white and becomes a major, and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Braugher </PERSON> -RRB-, a second-generation free black who volunteers as an enlisted man. Much of `` Glory'' focuses on the basic training of a ragtag group of runaway slaves and free men, who are denied all the basic supplies given to white soldiers, including proper shoes and the coveted blue uniform, and are asked to accept less pay. They have much to learn about soldiering and about human relations, in a fight for freedom and the restoration of the union. As Trip, an embittered runaway, <PERSON> Denzel </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> -LRB- `` Cry Freedom,'' `` The Mighty Quinn,'' `` Power'' -RRB- does a star turn. His hatred, desires, feelings are worn on his face, such as when he's flogged for supposedly trying to desert Not one word is uttered; he merely locks eyes with <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> -LRB- `` <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blues </LOCATION>,'' `` War Games'' -RRB- and allows a single tear to fall. <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, meanwhile, shows clear repulsion and sorrow. Why? Because the whip _ a symbol of the servitude from which the men had fled _ had been used on Trip in the past: His back is a jungle of ugly scars. `` Glory'' becomes Trip's story _ as well as <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION>'s _ as the runaway undergoes a radical self-realization. In the end, the 54th becomes the only family he's ever known. <PERSON> Zwick </PERSON>, the Emmy-award winning director of `` Special Bulletin'' and `` thirtysomething,'' stresses visual acting in `` Glory.'' Action speaks louder than words, and he focuses on facial expressions and body movements rather than histrionics, gimmicks or slick words. He also is spare with dialogue. When the 54th marches past the white regiments _ who regarded the blacks as a joke and less than men _ to lead the assault against <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, only four words are spoken by the once hostile whites: `` Give'em hell, 54.'' Ultimately, color no longer is the issue. The men are fellow soldiers about to die. And like `` Gallipoli'' and `` Hamburger Hill,'' the overriding issue becomes the utter futility of war. The battle scene at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wagner </LOCATION> is beautifully choreographed, the men running along the beach, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag full and billowing. It is poetic and yet powerful. `` Glory'' makes good use of battle scenes. They are exciting, frightening and realistic. At <LOCATION> James </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the 54th gets its first taste of fighting. After firing a few rounds and watching a Confederate unit retreat, more Confederates appear through the mist like gray ghosts and the battle soon becomes hand-to-hand combat. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> was second unit director, and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Minor </PERSON> coordinated the stunts. `` Glory'' is bound to be a contender at Oscar time. It also has a haunting but overused score by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>, with choral work by the Boys Choir of <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. The music is lovely but unfortunately the filmmakers use the same refrain so often that just about every scene becomes a climax. There are good performances by <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> -LRB- `` Street Smart,'' `` Driving Miss Daisy'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Jihmi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> as a stuttering enlisted man and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> as the fierce no-nonsense Irish sergeant-major who whips the 54th into shape. <PERSON> Braugher </PERSON>, whose theater credits include `` Much Ado About Nothing'' and `` King <PERSON> John </PERSON>'' at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Shakespeare Festival, makes his film debut in `` Glory,'' and is someone to watch. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> appears as <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>'s mother. The Freddie Fields production has a running time of 122 minutes and is rated R.

<HEAD>Mercenary Says President was Accidentally Slain by Bodyguard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A French mercenary widely blamed for killing the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Comoros </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islands </ORGANIZATION> said the president was accidentally shot by his own bodyguard during an army attack, a newspaper reported Wednesday. Meanwhile a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> news agency said <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> and South African officials met with the mercenary, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Denard </PERSON>, on Wednesday in an attempt to persuade him to leave the remote islands off southeast <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Denard </PERSON>, who heads the mercenary-led <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> on the islands, said President <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> was fatally shot on Nov. 26 during an assault by army troops, The Star newspaper reported from the Comoros capital of <LOCATION> Moroni </LOCATION>. The report did not say why the army was attacking the nation's leader <PERSON> Denard </PERSON>, in a statement read to journalists Tuesday night, said he was in the room with <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> at the presidential palace when the shooting occurred. But he again denied any responsibility for the killing, The Star reported. The mercenary, a veteran soldier of fortune who has fought in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, declined to answer questions or elaborate on the circumstances of <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON>'s death other than to say a bodyguard actually shot the president. <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> and 30 other French and Belgian mercenaries use the Presidential Guard to control the islands despite widespread opposition by residents, who have taken to the streets in protest. The mercenary said he was prepared to leave the islands if he is allowed to go `` with honor.'' He is negotiating with the French and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>, the largest aid donors to the Comoros, and wants financial compensation in exchange for leaving. The French news agency Agence France-Presse, in a report from <LOCATION> Moroni </LOCATION>, quoted unidentified sources as saying French and South African officials met with <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> for 20 minutes Wednesday morning. There was no information on what was discussed, but the agency said a sticking point is <PERSON> Denard </PERSON>'s demand for a guarantee he will not be prosecuted in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for his role in an unsuccessful 1977 coup in the West African country of <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION>. Comorans widely blame <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> for <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON>'s death. According to various sources, the two men argued about several matters just before the shooting. <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> helped engineer a coup that ousted <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> in 1975, the year the island nation became independent from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> then led a 1978 coup that restored <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> to power. He and his fellow mercenaries have remained a leading force on the islands ever since. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said at Wednesday's weekly Cabinet meeting that `` any idea of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> military intervention is excluded'' in the Comoros, government spokesman <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pensec </PERSON> told reporters

 Chileans elect a new government Thursday, returning to a democratic tradition that was a model for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> until Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> seized power in 1973. The opposition is expected to win. Of 7.5 million registered voters, 3.5 million have never voted in a real election. Voting is mandatory and failure to vote can bring a $ 95 fine. Most pre-election polls gave <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, who represents an alliance of 17 centrist and leftist parties, a lead of more than 20 percentage points over pro-government candidate <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>. A third candidate, 47-year-old conservative entrepreneur <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Errazuriz </PERSON>, is expected to finish far back. The opposition alliance led the effort that defeated <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in an October 1988 referendum by rejecting a proposal that he continue as president until 1997. That forced him to call elections. Although he will be out as president, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> says he will remain as army commander for eight more years, sheltered by a constitutional provision that prohibits the new president from dismissing him. The opposition has urged him to retire, but acknowledges it is the general's decision. A violent coup led by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in September 1973 overthrew the 3-year-old elected government of the late President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, an avowed Marxist, during a period of political and economic disorder. Interior Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> told foreign reporters the election was `` the culmination of a orderly, staged process'' that started the day of the coup. He said the military government `` had kept its word'' to restore democracy once it established order, rightened the economy and created a new legal framework for government. Upon taking power, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> had promised to rule `` only as long as circumstances demand.'' In preparation for the Thursday's vote, municipal workers stripped campaign posters from walls and telephone poles, and painted out political graffiti that blossomed in a generally peaceful campaign. Campaigning ended Monday night by law. Soldiers and police guarded polling places, along with strategic sites in the cities and countryside. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> made no public statements, but Gen. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucar </PERSON>, the deputy army commander, asked Chileans to `` go and vote peacefully, knowing they can count on all guarantees necessary to cast their ballots freely and secretly.'' <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> <PERSON> Cimma </PERSON>, met Wednesday with Gen. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Parera </PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> garrison, and said <PERSON> Parera </PERSON> gave assurances the armed forces would guarantee a clean vote. Another coalition official, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Krauss </PERSON>, asked the government to report voting results `` in strict accordance with the law.'' In the 1988 referendum, widespread allegations arose that negative results were held back for hours before the government admitted <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> had lost. <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> said initial results would be reported after the first 350,000 votes, about 5 percent of the total, were counted Thursday night and updated reports would follow every 90 minutes or so. <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> said final results for the 38 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats and the 120 in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> would be known about noon Friday. Cardinal <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fresno </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> said Wednesday: `` I believe we can now say in all truth that spirits have calmed and we can be confident of a new dawn in peace and fraternal friendship.'' The church was one of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s few outspoken critics during years of anti-leftist repression that followed the coup. It condemned violations of human rights, including the disappearances of hundreds of dissidents and the torture and expulsion of thousands more. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, 71, is a moderate Christian Democrat, active in politics for four decades and known for a low-key, conciliatory style. He has stressed the need to avoid confrontation and seek national reconciliation. <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>, 40, is an internationally respected technocrat who joined <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s economic team in 1975 and was finance minister from 1985 until May, a period of steady economic growth and low inflation. His advisers hope to keep <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>'s vote total below a majority in the three-way race and force a runoff.

 Town officials, fearing that beaver dams would flood recently repaired <LOCATION> Linseed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, decided to rub out the rodents but found themselves having to take on schoolchildren and The Beaver's Club. Pupils at <ORGANIZATION> Breor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in this small town about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> fired off a batch of letters last week accusing selectmen of being cruel and asking, `` please do n't kill the beavers.'' About six beavers live in a marshy field next to the road, according to <PERSON> Micki </PERSON> <PERSON> Seigel </PERSON>, who lives in the area and has printed up bumper stickers saying, `` I love the Linseed Road beavers.'' This week, a pupil's letter reached <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beavers </ORGANIZATION>' Club of <LOCATION> Hampden </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counties </ORGANIZATION>, a Holyoke-based service group, asking them to help their namesakes. Selectman Chairman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Zgrodnick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Wednesday he remains convinced that trapping is the best solution to protect the $ 350,000 worth of repairs on the road. `` I do n't know much about beaver dams, but I know they're bad,'' <PERSON> Zgrodnick </PERSON> said. He defended his decision not to call in an engineer before authorizing the trapping, but said an engineer would be called in this weekend to assess the potential for damage. <PERSON> Zgrodnick </PERSON> said selectmen told people opposing trapping that if they could find another way to deal with the problem `` very, very quickly, go ahead.'' Beaver Club President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Davignon </PERSON> said his group was not interested in joining the political fray, but was willing to consider a request for help if a compromise is agreed on, such as installing special drainage pipes. Club members visited <PERSON> Seigel </PERSON> this week at Running Gutter brook. A small beaver lodge and dam have turned the field by the road into a shallow pond now covered with ice. <PERSON> Seigel </PERSON> said her main objective was to buy time until the field froze over. `` I am not an animal rights activist,'' she said. `` It just seemed, why kill them if you do n't have to.'' The beavers appeared this summer and the issue of the road threat surfaced this fall, said <PERSON> Zgrodnik </PERSON>, who said he did not recall who first brought it up. Some in town said they were n't sure how the issue got so controversial. `` We were kind of caught surprised ourselves when we started reading in the newspapers and we started checking into it,'' said Water Commissioner <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Osepowicz </PERSON>. Even if beaver dams block storm drains, water will drain through slits cut into the curb, Highway Superintendent <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> was quoted as saying in a local newspaper last week. <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> had no comment Wednesday. `` All the answers come from town hall,'' he said. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, a biologist with the state Division of <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION>, said about 1,400 beavers are killed in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> each year during the season between Nov. 15 and Feb. 28. `` We get hundreds of nuisance complaints,'' <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said.

 In a decision <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> might admire, a judge Wednesday authorized Mrs. <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> to share equal gift-giving Christmas rights with her famous husband, and declared their sleigh `` community property.'' Furthermore, Mrs. <PERSON> Claus </PERSON>' title is now `` Ms.,'' and she is `` emancipated from any household duties'' so that she may accompany her jolly spouse on his airborne tours of the world, according to the ruling by <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Choppelas </PERSON>. Christmas generosity symbolized by <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> is a `` universal phenomenon'' and should have no gender strings attached, the judge added, undoubtedly with an eye to his political future. A courtroom jammed with spectators, reporters and photographers broke into cheers and applause at the conclusion of a rather unruly and holiday-happy 60th session of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s mock <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>. The just-for-fun court is a 14-year <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> tradition staged in a real City Hall courtroom, with a real judge, real lawyers, clerks and stenographers. Only the witnesses are phony. Everybody has a good time with such questions as who invented the martini, is chicken soup Jewish penicillin, and where did chop suey come from. `` Thank you for not starting without me,'' said the judge to the trial advocates, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Supervisor <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Alioto </PERSON>, who said <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> was a woman, and Public Defender <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who said he must remain a male. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who will run for re-election, let his witnesses carry the case. The stage was set by a reading of <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s `` A Visit From St. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>,'' by a local talk show personality.

 Talk of reunification raises the specter of a `` Fourth Reich,'' Communists said Wednesday, but West German plans for hundreds of millions of dollars in aid are the latest sign the two countries are coming together. A <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> newspaper quoted <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, the former West German chancellor, as saying the Soviets prevented a potential bloodbath in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> on Oct. 9, when protest against the old hard-line leadership of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> reached its peak. <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON>, interim president of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, told church leaders a new constitution expected next year would provide for individual states within a federal system, another sign of the Communists' continuing loss of power. Indignities continued for <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, the disgraced former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief deposed Oct. 18. The <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> took back the honorary citizenship bestowed on him in 1982. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the ultra-right <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said it would try to organize an East German sister party to enter candidates in free parliamentary elections planned for May. About 1,000 high school students, teachers and parents demonstrated in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> against mandatory instruction in the Russian language. Several thousand students and parents in the northern city of <LOCATION> Stralsund </LOCATION> demanded that teachers who belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> be fired, and 2,000 people in <LOCATION> Schwerin </LOCATION> demonstrated against German reunification, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> reported. For several weeks, at least a half-dozen new projects involving the two Germanys have been announced every day, many initiated by West Germans. The East German government has acknowledged the `` German question,'' but has publicly insisted no formal union will occur. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> must adhere to `` socialist, anti-fascist, pacifist and all international leftist traditions, especially those of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>.'' It said a West German `` pocketing'' of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was not on the agenda, and rejected `` a Fourth Reich, however that would be formed'' _ a reference to <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Third Reich. Other newspapers took a similar line against reunificiation, including <ORGANIZATION> Neue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION>, published by the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, who recently broke with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Neue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> said demonstrators in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> who called for reunification were expressing outdated `` megalomaniac dreams of Greater <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' New Forum, which has 200,000 members and is the largest opposition group, officially opposes reunification, but increasing calls for one German state at its Monday night rallies in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> have threatened to split the movement. In an interview with East German television, President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> cautioned against attempts to speed reunification and against `` heating up'' the already volatile political situation in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> opposes reunification and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has urged a cautious approach, but signs of a virtual de facto union grow daily. On Wednesday, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said it was providing $ 540 million to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for 17 environmental cleanup projects. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has one of the most polluted environments and some of the most fouled rivers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and experts say help is needed urgently to prevent an ecological catastrophe. Mayor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Momper </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and his <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> counterpart, <PERSON> Erhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Krack </PERSON>, announced agreements Wednesday ranging from joint subway tickets to Western investment in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Economics Minister <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> Luft </PERSON> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said she expects <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to pass a law on joint ventures within three months. West German businesses have been preparing for huge investments. West Germans have seized most of the initiative to date, prompting East German warnings against a wholesale national sellout to the rich, capitalist nation. East German cities also have appealed to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> sister cities for aid, however. West German cities have sent food, medicine, heaters and even scaffolding, municipal officials said at a conference in <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION>. On Thursday, Economics Minister <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is to meet with Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, bringing a three-point economic aid plan with him.

 State officials vowed they would fare better on their next visit to a potential radioactive waste dump site after they were chased and cornered for five hours Wednesday by anti-dump protesters. More than 100 dump opponents scored a moral, if not psychological victory, when they demanded police arrest them, or the members of a scouting team from the state <ORGANIZATION> Low-Level </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radioactive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Siting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, for trespassing. The commission's field teams were on a walking tour of the proposed site in the town of <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> when they were spotted around noon by more than 100 dump opponents, according to protest organizer <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. The protesters tracked footprints left by the seven state officials as they ran up and down hills in the wooded area before catching them on a county road and surrounding them with a human chain, said <LOCATION> Allegany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholes </PERSON>. The officials were released some five hours later after the owner of the land they were surveying filed a trespassing complaint against them. Meanwhile, 100 miles to the east, 20 protesters were arrested in <LOCATION> Cortland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> for disorderly conduct after they refused to allow a state inspection team to leave one of two potential sites there, according to a sheriff's department dispatcher. In <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scholes </PERSON> said the protesters ignored warnings to stay away from the proposed site and camped out there overnight. The dump opponents said the state officials were on private property and the owner was never told the team would be there to inspect his land. `` Either you arrest them or you arrest us,'' <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Allegany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nonviolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> told the officers. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Giovanniello </PERSON>, the owner of the property, said state officials did not have his permission to be on his land. `` They never notified me _ no phone call, no nothing,'' he said. Siting commission staff member <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodale </PERSON> called Giovanniello's claim `` sheer nonsense.'' After <PERSON> Giovanniello </PERSON> filed a written complaint against the state, the dump opponents allowed the officials to leave. As they did, the group howled and yelled, `` See you in the morning.'' Protesters vowed they would again block commission members from inspecting the other two possible dump sites in the county. <PERSON> Goodale </PERSON> promised his group would return. `` They may feel it is,'' a moral or psychological victory, said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkleberger </PERSON>, executive director of the commission, who visited the <LOCATION> Cortland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> site Wednesday. `` I consider it a draw. We did accomplish the task we set for ourselves for the day.'' Commission officials in the <LOCATION> Cortland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> town of <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> had to be escorted two miles after protesters there formed a human chain and pinned them in their cars. The anti-dump group sent cars, trucks and tractors to the site Wednesday morning after members who have been watching the two <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> sites around the clock reported the state field crew's arrival, said <PERSON> Taffy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rook </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Citizens Against Radioactive Dumping At one point, three state officials and several deputies were `` trapped'' in the woods by protesters who had blocked all roads leading to the site, <PERSON> Rook </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Concerned Citizens of <LOCATION> Allegany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said about 20 protesters camped out overnight in freezing temperatures at two of the three Allegany sites to block state officials from beginning inspections on land there. They were joined by other protesters at daybreak, she said. Siting Commission officials said they hoped to start testing possible sites after the deer hunting season ended Tuesday. `` I hope that people do n't go outside the law,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baranski </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the commission. `` The courts have made it clear that the commission has the right and responsibility to do this.'' Anti-dump groups in <LOCATION> Allegany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cortland </LOCATION> counties have promised to prevent the testing from taking place. The groups said their protests would be nonviolent but said they expected arrests. The five possible sites were chosen by the commission in September. Under federal law, states must have a place to store low-level radioactive waste by 1993. The commission plans to complete soil testing and other evaluations by spring. The commission will then narrow down the number of sites to two or three for more comprehensive tests.

<HEAD>School Program Launched to Reduce Gun Violence Among Youths</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's first comprehensive program to teach kindergartners and high schoolers alike about the dangers of guns was launched Wednesday by <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s public schools. The special curriculum was developed following a record 43 gunshot deaths last year in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> of children 18 and under; so far this year, at least 48 children have been killed in gun-related incidents in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION>, school officials said. The program was made necessary by an increase in the prevalence of guns in society, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Krop </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` We now feel compelled, unfortunately, to teach kids about guns,'' <PERSON> Krop </PERSON> said earlier at a news conference at Coconut Grove Elementary. `` Essentially our message to young people is, ` You do n't touch a handgun.''' That message will be reinforced in the classroom with discussions aimed at helping students recognize unsafe situations and know how to react when encountering guns. A video also will be shown to middle and senior high students focusing on the trauma of a gunshot death or injury _ through the experiences of other kids. One teen-ager describes the trauma of accidentally shooting his father; also interviewed were a football player left paralyzed and a girl who lost a leg in gun attacks. Brochures and a video were being prepared for parents to help them insure the safety of their children. Wednesday was declared `` Gun Safety Awareness Day'' by <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's fourth-largest school district. `` Today's youngsters are at a greater risk of gun violence than any previous generation,'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautman </PERSON>, executive director of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence in <LOCATION> Washignton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said Friday at the news conference. `` We want the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> program to serve as the national standard for education to reduce gun violence, death and injury among youth.'' In 1987, one out of every 10 children who died in the nation was killed with a gun, and gun accidents were the fourth leading cause of accidental death for children, according to Ms. <PERSON> Lautman </PERSON>. A new state law aimed at protecting children from accidental shootings also authorized the development of a gun-safety program in public schools. The measure, which took effect in October, requires gun owners to take reasonable precautions to keep loaded weapons away from children 15 and younger; the law provides for jail time and fines for gun owner's carelessness. <PERSON> Dade </PERSON>'s program to prevent gun injuries and deaths among children is tailored by age groups. For example, at the elementary level the emphasis will be on role-playing, while in the sixth through 12th grades, students will focus on issues surrounding gun violence, including conflict resolution activities and the role of the media. The curriculum was developed following discussions in April led by volunteers from the <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION> with some 400 middle and senior high students about guns and gun violence. Among the findings, released Wednesday, were that students have mixed opinions on whether guns are good or bad, with black and Hispanics most aware of and involved with daily handgun violence; students believe guns are more common today than at previous times; and that anti-gun messages need to show more the pain and loss suffered by victims of gun violence. <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dupuch </PERSON>, a second grader at <ORGANIZATION> Coconut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grove </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION>, said he had never been around a gun but he knew what they could do. `` Kill,'' he said without hesitation. And what had he learned so far about them? `` Not to touch guns,'' said the shy 7-year-old.

 A band of 10 to 12 raiders attacked a security post near the Irish border with guns and bombs Wednesday, killing two British soldiers and seriously injuring a third, police said. No group claimed responsibility, but suspicion fell on guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> fighting British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The gunmen escaped unhurt after the attack at <LOCATION> Derryard </LOCATION>, an isolated checkpoint about two miles from the Fermanagh border with <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monaghan </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> said. The victims were members of the 1st Battalion of the King's Own Scottish Borderers. Six other soldiers and a police officer survived unhurt. A police statement gave this account: A truck backed up to the checkpoint. As soldiers approached, men inside opened fire and threw grenades, killing one soldier. As the men were firing, a van was driven into the checkpoint and abandoned. A short time later, it exploded, killing another soldier and wounding a third. The truck sped away. An army patrol spotted it headed for the border. The patrol fired but the men escaped, abandoning the vehicle at the border. About four hours before the attack, 12 masked gunman with a truck and van took over a nearby house. They left shortly before the attack, taking a tractor that had not been recovered. The deaths brought to 12 the number of British soldiers killed in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> this year.

<DATELINE>FORT BENNING, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soldiers marched onto a computerized Fort Benning range Wednesday to demonstrate four of the world's most advanced military rifles _ technology the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> hopes will double the combat effectiveness of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in the 21st century Firing single shots and bursts, the helmeted shooters scored hits on stationary and moving targets up to 300 meters away while loudspeakers rattled with the sounds of returning `` enemy'' fire to heighten their stress levels. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> will begin seven months of tests next month to see if new weapons technology can help soldiers score twice as many hits on the battlefield despite fear and fast-moving targets. Four companies have supplied prototypes for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s Advanced Combat Rifle test. All the rifles fire in the semi-automatic and fully automatic modes, and three can fire three-shot bursts designed to overcome aiming errors. The Colt Industries' version is derived from the M-16 but has a redesigned handguard pistol grip and an adjustable buttstock for improved handling. It fires standard M-16 ammunition or a duplex cartridge with two rounds. Colt says one bullet travels straight to the target; the other diverges slightly to improve the hit probability. A rifle submitted by the <ORGANIZATION> AAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hunt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, uses a standard brass cartridge, but the projectile is a steel dart known as a `` flechette.'' Flechettes are lighter than bullets, move faster and have a flatter trajectory that makes them accurate to 600 meters, said <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shisler </PERSON>, the ARC project manager, from <ORGANIZATION> Picatinny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arsenal </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>. A rifle submitted by <PERSON> Steyr-Mannlicher </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Steyr </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, fires a steel flechette from a cartridge with a plastic case The futuristic-looking Steyr design is shorter than conventional military rifles because its operating mechanism is in the buttstock. The Heckler & amp; <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> prototype, resembling an elongated home video camera, also has the mechanism in the buttstock. The West German rifle fires a small bullet from a rectangular `` caseless'' cartridge made from molded propellant. The cartridge is about 1 inch long and three-eighths of an inch square. The H & amp; K and <ORGANIZATION> Steyr </ORGANIZATION> ammunition are extremely light. Besides the prototypes, soldiers will fire M-16 rifles to provide control data during the test. <PERSON> Shisler </PERSON> said the new rifles are among the world's most advanced military weapons and the first to include features such as multiple projectiles and burst firing that help overcome human factors. `` We've always wanted a weapon to be reliable, to be accurate to perform under all kinds of environments and conditions,'' he said. `` These guns are more fireable. They fit the soldier better. ... What we're trying to do is help compensate for problems the shooter has because he's scared, because he's in combat.'' The Army has spent about $ 40 million since 1982 on research and development and expects to spend another $ 17 million by 1991 when officials decide which technology, if any, to pursue. If one of the designs is accepted, soldiers could have the M-16 replacement as early as 1996, officials said at a briefing Wednesday. Starting Jan. 16, the rifles will be tested by teams of 18 <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> shooters on a computerized $ 2.7 million range. They'll fire at moving and stationary targets from 25 to 600 meters from prone, standing and foxhole positions. Another 18-member team will arrive in April. Ten female shooters will test the weapons in August and September. Each target has curved rods that sense the projectiles' shockwaves as they travel within 15 feet of the target So, the computer not only plots the shooters' hits and displays them on video monitors, but also their misses. Army officials said it's impossible to duplicate combat conditions, but shooters will feel added stress because of interservice rivalry and peer pressure. They'll exercise before firing and wear heart monitors during the tests. Army tests indicate an M-16 rifle fired under ideal conditions can hit 300 meter targets whenever the trigger is pulled. The hit probability at the same distance drops to about 65 percent during marksmanship training. `` The M-16 was a fine weapon. It's reliable and accurate. It ranks among the best,'' <PERSON> Shisler </PERSON> said. `` In combat, soldiers are frightened and do n't have time to aim. Our goal is to increase their effectiveness.''

 A man accused of plotting to assassinate President <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bongo </PERSON> has died, the second alleged conspirator to die in custody, the official <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION> news agency AGP reported Wednesday. The agency, citing medical sources, said <PERSON> Doukakas </PERSON> <PERSON> Nziengui </PERSON> died Tuesday afternoon at <LOCATION> Libreville </LOCATION>'s central hospital of `` excessive arterial tension.'' In <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, a group called the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Respect </ORGANIZATION> and Application of the African Charter of Human Rights charged that <PERSON> Nziengui </PERSON> died in prison while being interrogated. A second man accused in the case, 39-year-old <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, died in early November in prison of malaria, the news agency said. Gabonese officials announced in October that they had foiled a plot to kill <PERSON> Bongo </PERSON> on Sept. 23, saying the conspirators intended to arrest the prime minister, defense minister and parliament speaker and take control of the government of this former French colony in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Hungarian Prime Minister <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> said Wednesday that his country was the first <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc nation to `` probe the limits of Soviet tolerance'' and that one major goal now is to avoid an explosion. <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON>'s comment came as he cut a scheduled three-day British visit to 12 hours because of the pace of events at home. He cautioned that a proposed austerity budget will provoke opposition, but said tough measures are <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s only hope of developing a market-oriented economy. `` This program is not being applauded by the people ... tensions will emerge,'' he said, speaking through an interpreter at a news conference. `` What everybody needs to comprehend now is that the future of the country is at stake. Stability and avoiding an explosion _ this is one of the main lines of Hungarian policy.'' <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> reacted coolly to a suggestion that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is being cautious about distancing itself politically from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was the first to probe the limits of Soviet tolerance,'' <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> said, referring to the dissolution of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> before the rapid changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` And do n't forget, in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> this was not done in the streets.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> disbanded itself in October and formed the the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which espouses democratic principles. In <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s first democratic elections for 41 years due next year, the party will compete with others for power. <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON>, 41, a reformist member of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s former communist party, came to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as 24 industrialized nations coordinating a big aid program to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> met in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. His visit was part of an aggressive campaign for Western aid. He also wants access to Western high technology denied to communist countries during the Cold War. Western countries have pushed for austerity as a condition for aid. `` We are not able to do it on our own,'' <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is not looking simply for smiles and pats on the back.

 The government Wednesday appealed to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for fast approval of its plans for economic reform but said it does n't need special powers to bypass lawmakers as proposed by Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. Deputy Finance Minister <PERSON> Marek </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabrowski </PERSON> told a news conference that if the austerity measures, tight budget and anti-inflationary plans succeed, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s 900 percent annual inflation rate will disappear by mid-1990. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> caused a sensation Tuesday when he said <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> should simply grant the government wide powers to put into effect whatever economic measures it deems necessary to combat the nation's $ 39 billion foreign debt, widespread shortages of goods and industrial production problems. `` Time is running out,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said when he made the proposal. Parliamentary debate on all the laws could delay the program, he said. However, government spokeswoman <PERSON> Malgorzata </PERSON> <PERSON> Niezabitowska </PERSON> said at the news conference with <PERSON> Dabrowski </PERSON> that the government was surprised by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s proposal. She said it will not seek special powers because it would rather have <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> approve the legislation, although `` in a speeded-up way.'' `` The success of the whole difficult project depends to a great extent on social support. Thus, the opinion of society's representation, of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, is of great significance to us,'' said the spokeswoman However, when pressed, she said she could not exclude the government accepting special powers if <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> decides to give them. The economic plan of the Solidarity-led government has been praised by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> will complete `` in the nearest days'' a letter of intent outlining the program, the official said. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> would grant about $ 700 million in loans to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in exchange for the reforms. The agreement would also open the door to a broader flow of credit and financial aid, with promised help from Western countries already exceeding $ 3.2 billion, <PERSON> Dabrowski </PERSON> said. If the government's plans succeed, the pace of price rises, currently more than 50 percent a month, should fall to an average 25 percent a month in the first quarter of 1990, said <PERSON> Dabrowski </PERSON>. They should fall 2 to 3 percent more each month for the rest of that year, he said. Inflation will be cut through reduced government spending and tax increases to balance the budget, limits on wage increases through tax penalties, an end to government subsidies to force inefficient enterprises to close, and making the Polish zloty fully convertible against hard currencies in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The effect will be `` dramatic,'' the deputy minister said. It may cut real incomes by 20 percent, industrial production by 5 percent, and the gross national product by 2 to 3 percent, he said. Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s government has been working around the clock this week to prepare by Sunday more than a dozen pieces of legislation to radically transform the economy beginning Jan. 1.

 Soviet diplomat <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Nosenko </PERSON> said Wednesday that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> should take part in the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> peace process and help negotiate a cut in the flow of arms to the region. `` The time has come in which <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> must return to the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> family in order to negotiate a reduction in the flow of arms to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Nosenko </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview. <PERSON> Nosenko </PERSON> is from the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s Latin American Department. He said he came here to take a closer look at a summit of five Central American presidents. The meeting concluded Tuesday with a call for the demobilization of Salvadoran leftist guerrillas and U.S.-supported Nicaraguan Contras and an end to all help for insurgents in the region. The presidents asked the superpowers not to interfere in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` If <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> takes part directly in the negotiations we can know its position and try to gain some kind of accord,'' <PERSON> Nosenko </PERSON> said before returning to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He refused to elaborate, but said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should guarantee the accords reached by the Central American presidents. `` I think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are very close in their positions, because both countries want a diplomatic solution to the crisis in this region,'' <PERSON> Nosenko </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nosenko </PERSON> reiterated that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> stopped all arms shipments to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government last year. However, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said last week that a Soviet ship with a cargo of helicopters was due Dec. 18 at <LOCATION> Corinto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast.

The somber comic book hero's clash with the Joker rang up an estimated $ 21 million in rentals from its Nov. 17 release until Dec. 4, eclipsing `` E.T.

The previous high was 91.8 million in rentals, set in the last week of November 1988, when `` E.T.'' was released. When it comes to video sales, however, it appears that <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>'s `` E.T.'' probably will outperform `` Batman.''

 The district attorney acknowledged Wednesday that he is investigating charges that the Rev. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for homeless youth, improperly spent the shelter's funds. After nearly two days of silence amid news reports that <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> provided an apartment, money and gifts to a young male prostitute and took him on trips, <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> issued a statement saying the probe was in its `` earliest stages.'' `` No determination has been made as to the truth of the allegations, nor can such a determination be made until the investigation has been concluded,'' <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said. But he said, `` Press reports of leaks attributed to unnamed law enforcement officials are inaccurate, may unfairly damage reputations and can only impede the investigation.'' Spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> denied the young man's allegations. `` We categorically deny any kind of -LRB- illicit -RRB- relationship between Father <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> and this youth,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Harnett </PERSON>, the shelter's chief executive officer The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that investigators had the youth wear a recording device during a conversation with <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> in an effort to confirm the illicit sex allegations. A law enforcement source told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the youth's name was <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, 20 It is not clear whether <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> managed to record anything but <PERSON> Harnett </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> suspected at the time that he was `` possibly being set up.'' He added that he was not concerned about anything <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> may have said. `` I think it was outrageous and disgusting for the district attorney to outfit this kid with a wire to try to entrap <PERSON> Father </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Harnett </PERSON> said. `` I can tell you Father <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> is a lot calmer about this than I am.'' The law enforcement source, who spoke to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on condition of anonymity, said the probe began after <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> took his allegations and `` documentation'' to the district attorney's office. The source said the young man worked in <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s computer operation and was able to obtain printouts about expenditures that he gave investigators Investigators are looking into the matter as possible financial misconduct, the source said. <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> staffers are cooperating fully with the investigation and no subpoenas have been necessary. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, 62, a Franciscan priest, brought <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in February after the young man told the priest he wanted to escape prostitution. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> called the allegations `` scurrilous'' lies and said the young man had emotional problems. The Post, meanwhile, reported that a female employee at <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had said <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> might have been involved with a second youth. Officials of the district attorney's office refused to comment. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> has hired a criminal defense attorney, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON>. `` There is no case and there never was any case'' against <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who had been silent on the case, issued a statement in support of <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>. `` In all my personal association with <PERSON> Father </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> and those who work with him, I have seen nothing but self-sacrifice and commitment to the most abandoned in society. `` As archbishop of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, I have held Father <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>'s work in high esteem,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> opened in 1969 after six teens showed up at his apartment looking for a place to stay, according to spokesmen for the shelter. Since then the organization has grown into an $ 85 million-a-year operation with seven shelters in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, one in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, and four in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The organization gets more than 90 percent of its funds from private donations.

 A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> appeals court set aside the conviction of death row inmate <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> on Wednesday, more than two years after a judge ruled the black man was unfairly tried in the slaying of a white teen-ager. `` This will make this Christmas as bright as can be. It was worth the wait,'' <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> said from the visiting area of death row, where he spent nearly nine years and once came within six days of execution before getting a stay. `` It's been a long time,'' <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>, 38, said after he was told the court's decision. `` I'm very thankful. I did n't know what it was going to, when it was going to be. It's a prayer that's been answered. It's going to take some time to sink in _ to soak in.'' In a 6-3 decision, the appellate court said <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> did not get a fair trial when a jury convicted him of the 1980 strangulation and rape of a teen-ager at <ORGANIZATION> Conroe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> was a janitor. His first trial ended with a hung jury. An all-white jury found him guilty in a second trial. <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>'s attorneys and supporters contended the conviction was racially motivated. Then on Oct. 9, 1987, after a 10-day evidentiary hearing moved from <LOCATION> Conroe </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, retired state District Judge <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON> recommended that <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> get a new trial because the previous two had been tainted with racism. In Wednesday's decision, the Austin-based appeals court said the state's investigation of the slaying led to a trial that lacked `` the rudiments of fairness'' and ordered <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> released to the custody of the <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff for a possible new trial. <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Speers </PERSON> said Wednesday he was `` obviously disappointed'' with the court's ruling. `` I felt the conviction should have been upheld,'' said <PERSON> Speers </PERSON>, who declined to comment further until he had reviewed the court's decision He planned a Thursday afternoon press conference, possibly to discuss whether he will pursue a third trial. Prosecutors have maintained that <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> is guilty and denied allegations that he was the subject of racial discrimination. <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> is the third <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> inmate in a year whose conviction has been set aside in cases that have drawn national attention. The court set aside the capital murder conviction of <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, whose case was the subject of the movie `` The Thin Blue Line,'' for the 1976 slaying of a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officer. The court later set aside the robbery conviction of <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> woman who prosecutors say will be tried again for her alleged part in the 1980 robbery of a fur store. The court said the outrage over the teen-ager's murder `` can not justify the subversion of justice that took place during the investigation, which ultimately affected the trial of her accused perpetrator.'' <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGeurin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, said he would ask the court to set bail for his client and hoped <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> would be home for Christmas. The appeals court refused Wednesday afternoon to set bond, and <PERSON> DeGeurin </PERSON>'s bail motion in a <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> district court was not ruled on by late Wednesday afternoon from the 122nd district court in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>'s attorneys offered evidence that police and <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutors had set out to prove that <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>, the only black janitor at the school, was guilty, rather than seeking the real killer. Another janitor who testified for the state allegedly was threatened by a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Ranger, and the state suppressed information that could have implicated someone other than <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>, according to examples of improper investigation cited by the appeals court. `` I'm sitting here screaming having a fit, I'm so happy,'' said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON> of the Free <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> <PERSON> Coalition </PERSON>, a 200-member, Houston-based group that has fought to keep <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>'s case in the public eye. `` We're just excited. We just ca n't believe it.'' `` Thank-you Jesus!'' said <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ola </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>, when she was told of the court's decision. `` Pray for us and let's hope everything works out.'' `` I'm thrilled to death for <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> and his family,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Beathard </PERSON>, a fellow inmate. `` But I hope nobody out there makes the corny comment that the system works. The system failed <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON>. It's been eight years. And there are more and more of these cases coming up.''

 The government announced its economic recovery plan Wednesday, promising five more years of bureaucratic control of such mundane details of life as the number of eggs produced for each Soviet consumer. Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> rejected radical reforms like the legalization of private property and the selling off of money-losing state enterprises, drawing immediate scorn from disappointed progressives in the Soviet Parliament. If bureaucrats really want to raise annual egg production _ targeted at 285 per person by 1995 _ they should raise chickens, economist and parliamentarian <PERSON> Gavriil </PERSON> <PERSON> Popov </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. `` Five years ago, we said it was a choice between five-year plans and perestroika, and unfortunately, it turns out the five-year plan has won,'' said fellow deputy <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunich </PERSON>, in the lobby outside the snow-covered <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s Palace of Congresses. The government proposal shifts the emphasis of traditional central planning away from heavy industry to consumer goods and services. They are to quadruple in the next five-year plan, from 1991-96. It also would transfer some control from bureaucrats in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to those in the republics. Elsewhere in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc Wednesday: _ <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s opposition and Communists agreed that the president should be elected by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> before Jan. 31, according to negotiators. There was no agreement on who would become president, only that the person would be a Czech not affiliated to any political party. That seems to point toward opposition leader <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, a symbol of the country's peaceful revolution. Earlier, the new opposition-dominated government said it is drafting laws ensuring freedom of religion, assembly and association. _ <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> expelled <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, the hard-line leader ousted last month after a 35-year rule, and agreed to join other <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> parties in surrendering its guarantee of supreme power. _ Communists in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said talk of reunification raises the specter of a `` Fourth Reich,'' but West German plans for massive aid infusions indicate the countries are quickly coming together. _ Poles marked the eighth anniversary of the 1981 martial-law crackdown, which Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said should be a reminder of the need for `` pluralism and tolerance.'' _ <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> outlined their economic reforms at a meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, with 24 Western nations that are coordinating aid to prevent Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s reforms from being derailed by economic troubles. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> believes it can salvage the sinking Soviet economy without resorting to Western economic models. He claimed his plan was a radical reform `` for carrying the economy out of a crisis.'' Food and consumer goods are in painfully short supply and authorities are wondering whether they'll have enough fuel to heat apartments through the long winter. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> deputy <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreev </PERSON> said the plan was so bad he hoped the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would throw it back at the government for a complete rewrite. Moreover, he suggested the ministers responsible be replaced. The government's moves toward a market economy are vague and fragmented, dooming them from the start, said <PERSON> Popov </PERSON>, one of 300 deputies who signed up to comment. `` You ca n't assemble it gradually,'' he said. `` You ca n't have the carburetor working while the starter is idle. If the motor is working, it must be working completely.'' `` Enterprises are drowning, not because they do n't know how to swim, but because the center has tied their hands,'' he said. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>'s program was a clear victory for the conservatives, who dominate the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> even rejected the program of his own top economist, Deputy Premier <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON>, who had urged the sale of unprofitable state enterprises beginning in 1991. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> agriculture chief <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> stood up to reject reformers' suggestions that `` small peasant holdings'' could solve the country's food crisis. He said the only reason huge collective farms can not feed the Soviet people is lack of technology and cash, and announced that they turned a profit of $ 10 billion last year _ for the first time in their 60 years of existence. It was not clear how <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> arrived at the profit figure. While this year's harvest was good, there have been no reports of drastic improvements in farm productivity or increases in state prices that would explain such a sudden jump in profits. The proposal calls for control to shift from bureaucrats in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to bureaucrats and factory managers in the republics. Despite lip service to creation of a `` socialist market,'' consumer demand still would not drive Soviet decisions about design, production and distribution. `` Does this mean we abandon planning? Of course not,'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said. `` We have to leave free to the market only that part of production that would not lead to unbalancing the economy.'' Price reform would be postponed until 1991 and 1992, and even then, some would remain under state control. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> desperately needs to reform its state-set prices, which waste enormous resources by charging too little for scarce and expensive goods. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> indicated that every plan for price reform had been opposed. The program did include surface changes, including the creation of government bonds, raising interest rates, and long-term land leasing. The 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> interrupted the premier's 1-hour, 45-minute speech with lukewarm applause only when <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> declared the state would remain the owner of `` means of production'' _ factories and equipment. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said the government would begin using more economic rather than managerial means to run the economy in a second stage of reform beginning in 1993. He specifically cited control of prices, credit and investment. His report appeared to contain nothing that would give Soviets an incentive to work efficiently.

 Despite concerns about security, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will go to violence-torn <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> on Feb. 15 for a four-nation summit on illegal drugs. The meeting, expected to last one day, will be in <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s north coast. The region is infamous as a haven for cocaine druglords, who are waging a campaign of violence in retaliation for a crackdown by the government of President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>. Other participants, in addition to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, will be President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. On Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had expressed determination to attend the summit but said a final decision was still pending and `` I will not do anything imprudent.'' Praising Barco for battling the drug cartel, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said, `` I do n't want to undermine the courageous stances he's taking. ... And I do n't want to be the one that sends a signal that nobody should go to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> because they ca n't be protected.'' One top administration official said Wednesday night the drug summit probably will be held at a <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> naval base. The official said that for better overall security the entire <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> entourage, including staff and the press corps, would remain at the same location, rather than operating from separate site than the talks, as is often the case on presidential foreign trips. Wednesday's announcement came after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed legislation authorizing $ 240 million in aid for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> to help the Andean nations wage their war against drugs. The three <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations are the source of most of the world's cocaine supply. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had promised the increased aid as part of the anti-drug strategy he unveiled Sept. 5. The legislation authorizes spending $ 115 million for narcotics control assistance and $ 125 million for military and law enforcement aid to the three countries. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated his commitment to help the nations that `` form the front lines of the struggle against the drug cartels.'' Disrupting and dismantling `` the criminal organizations that support the international production, processing and trafficking of drugs are essential components of our national drug control strategy,'' he said. The violence in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> since President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> declared war on the drug cartels `` shows that they are entrenched and powerful. International cooperation is essential if they are to be defeated, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in particular, must be generous in providing assistance,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The measure waives restrictions on using <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid to train police. It also raises from $ 500,000 to $ 2 million the rewards the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will pay for information leading to arrest and prosecution of international terrorists. While praising <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` for this timely response to my request,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also registered an exception to a provision that would allow either <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to block aid if the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> fails to submit certain reports. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> regards any such legislative veto provision as unconstitutional.

 A woman who walked away from prison nearly 12 years ago and lived a model life until her arrest last year was granted parole Wednesday and is to be released Friday. `` I just ask for forgiveness,'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 38, told the state parole board during a 15-minute hearing. `` I just want you to know I have changed my way of thinking.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was serving a 12-year sentence for the armed robbery of a jewelry store when she escaped. While a fugitive, she earned a high school diploma, overcame drug and alcohol abuse, remarried and began a successful career in real estate. The Department of Probation, <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> board, which rejected Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s request for parole in May, voted 6-1 for parole on Wednesday. The Severn, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, woman is to be released Friday from the Women's Correctional Center in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> `` I'm sure it's going to be hard to stay in a little cell,'' knowing freedom is imminent, Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said at a news conference after the vote. The board stipulated that Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> will be supervised by <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> authorities until March 1996. She also must make restitution to the jewelry store she robbed of $ 4,300 in cash and jewelry in 1974. In January 1978, Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, then known as <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, walked away from a work-release center in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, and embarked on her new life. In May 1988, police tipped by her ex-husband, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, arrested the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> native at her new home in Severn. Only then did her second husband, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, and her sons, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, 19, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, 18, learn her past. After her capture, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> allowed Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> to serve her time at a prison in <LOCATION> Jessup </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, so she could be near her family. She was brought to <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> this week for the parole hearing. Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said she plans to recruit and train real estate agents, and try to lead a normal life without fear of the law. `` I hope to just be settled and have a routine day with a routine job and a routine home life,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> expressed regret over her past, saying, `` I wish that I could take it all back but I ca n't.'' <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON>, the lone dissenter in Wednesday's parole board vote, noted that Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was indicted on five counts of armed robbery and twice fled custody _ the first time in October 1975 when she walked out of a <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> corrections facility. She was captured the same day. But a police officer in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> who worked on Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s case and the solicitor who prosecuted her last year for the escape charge both wrote letters to the board recommending her for parole

 Friends of <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> said Wednesday the announcement by Salvadoran officials of her release proved her innocence. A senator said the move averted a rift in U.S.-Salvadoran relations. Casolo, 28 and a native of <LOCATION> Thomaston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, had been accused of storing weapons for leftist rebels in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, where President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said the church worker would be freed and expelled despite his being `` morally convinced that Miss Casolo is quilty.'' Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Wednesday night. Salvadoran officials said prosecutors had failed to develop sufficient evidence linking Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> to a cache of weapons found buried behind her house the day of her arrest Nov. 26. `` You do n't know whether to laugh because you're happy or cry because you're happy,'' said <PERSON> Susanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminar </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the lay church group that sent Casolo to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to conduct non-partisan tours of the country for church workers and visiting officials. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, who wept as she spoke of <LOCATION> Casolo </LOCATION>, said, `` We hope this helps stop the persecution of church workers that's going on in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. ... This confirms our standing all along of her innocence.'' <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, speaking at a news conference Wednesday in the <LOCATION> Wethersfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, office of Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, thanked volunteers and officials `` for bringing our daughter home.'' Her mother, <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, added, `` I am deeply grateful to each and every one who has believed in <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> and her innocence.'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, who had spoken by telephone several times with <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> over the last several days, said the decision to free <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> was a favorable development in relations between the two countries. `` I welcome this announcement for the signal it sends about the legal system in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> _ a system that has not exactly distinguished itself for fairness or even humaneness in recent years,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, a moderate Democrat who has supported military aid to <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s government, praised <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s handling of the matter and stressed that he had made no threats or promises about his support for continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. `` There were no deals. There are no conditions on aid,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, D-Conn., said the release of <LOCATION> Casolo </LOCATION>, `` certainly avoids what could have been a disaster in terms of their relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He added, `` The result, whether it was judicially motivated or politically motivated or both, is very positive.'' But other congressmen said the resolution of <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s case does not resolve problems for church workers still held in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON>, D-Wash., who visited <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> in prison, said: `` There are many individuals who do not receive such fortunate treatment and who do not have the benefit of so many friends in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> Our relief at <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>'s release must not diminish our concern for the many other church workers she leaves behind.'' And Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass. and an opponent of military aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, predicted that persecution of other church workers would not end. `` One has to ask: If the government did not have the evidence to bring her to trial, why did it see fit to deport her?'' he commented. Friends and officials viewed the decision to expel <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> as necessary to protect her. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gans </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> classmate of <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s, said, `` It's not a fair result in the sense that any sort of guilt would come with that.'' <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said she was `` very sensitive to how she feels about leaving the country.'' Casolo has been in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> since 1985 and has said she wanted to stay, even if that meant standing trial. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said he too regretted the expulsion but added that, `` in terms of personal safety, -LRB- it -RRB- is probably in <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>'s best interest.''

 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> on Wednesday described the views of those who advocate the legalization of drugs as `` stupid and morally atrocious.'' `` It does n't make any sense,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview. `` It is becoming something of a fashion to believe this in certain circles of opinion. But even though it's fashionable, it's still every bit as dumb and compassionless as it was before. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> pressed his counter-offensive against the increasingly outspoken ranks of those arguing for drug legalization a day after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweet </PERSON> said drugs _ including cocaine and heroin _ should be legalized, taxed and dispensed by the state because the war on narcotics is being lost. Sweet, a Republican and former prosecutor appointed by President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> as a trial judge in the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, said it was `` time to abolish the prohibition _ to cease treating indulgence in mind-alteration as a crime.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who denounced such views in a speech at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, said Wednesday that he is unswayed by the growth in the number of legalization advocates or by the fact that they cut across the political spectrum and include, for the first time, a federal judge. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, visiting <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said the judge was `` simply out of step with mainstream <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ... We totally reject the idea that the way to solve the drug problem challenging <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is to simply roll over and legalize it. It's not going to happen in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration.'' `` Judges are n't any more immune to ignorance than people in other professions,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` If he does n't like his work, if he's tired of sentencing people, he should find another line of work,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said about Sweet. `` It's better to have clogged courts ... than crowded, jammed pediatric wards of cocaine babies, which we will have a lot more of if we take his proposal seriously.'' The legalization argument `` is as stupid and morally atrocious as it ever was,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. Sweet, in Tuesday's speech before the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yrk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmopolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said the result of drug legalization `` would be the elimination of the profit motive, the gangs, the drug dealers. Obviously, the model is the repeal of Prohibition and the end of <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> and Dutch <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>.'' Sweet was harshly criticized by other officials, including Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D-Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` Judge Sweet is absolutely wrong,'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said. `` If his policy were accepted, he would be consigning millions of more to lives of addictions. He would be responsible for the deaths of millions more. ... It is a policy that is irresponsible.'' <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the special <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state prosecutor for narcotics, agreed with <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>. `` This is a classic case of Sweet going sour,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, Sweet's secretary, said the judge was conducting a trial Wednesday and was not available for comment. The ranks of drug legalization advocates include conservative political commentator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, economist <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION>'s Democratic Mayor <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> rattled the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration by stating similar views in a speech given at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and excerpted in the Wall Street Journal in October. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he does n't believe the arguments will `` change the basic views of most Americans. They've seen it up close. Anybody who has seen a child go through this is not likely to be moved by this abstract argument.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he opposes legalizing any kind of drug, even marijuana, despite the fact that he does n't believe it's more harmful than alcohol. `` The last thing I would want to do is recommend the wider use of a drug that makes young people stupid. ... We have enough of a problem with liquor, thank you.'' But he's not advocating a return to Prohibition: `` We ca n't go back. Society's made a judgment it's OK. But we certainly do n't have to compound the problem.

<HEAD>Britain Calls for Lifting Sanctions to End Apartheid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said Wednesday the way to end apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is by gradually lifting economic sanctions as the government dismantles its segregation system rather than imposing a trade embargo. Attempts to isolate the government of South African President F.W. de Klerk are not the answer, British Ambassador Sir <PERSON> Crispin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s Special Session on Apartheid. `` Nor are sanctions. ... They certainly weaken the South African economy, and in doing so they increase misery and poverty, in particular among the most vulnerable parts of the community,'' its black majority, he said. `` Their political effect is to increase resistance to change rather than to encourage it,'' <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON> said. `` When Mr. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> does take the necessary steps, we believe it would then be right to lift some of the measures imposed by the international community, so as to acknowledge progress and encourage <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to proceed further down the path of dialogue.'' <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON>'s advice received polite applause; in the 159-member <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, the overwhelming majority of nations believe <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is implementing limited reforms only in response to the limited sanctions imposed so far. Most nations favor a total, mandatory trade embargo against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, butthe <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> have used their veto power in the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to consistently block such moves. A <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> call for all nations to sever economic, military, sports and cultural links with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> also has met with partial success. Apartheid has established a racially segregated society in which the 28 million South African blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 <LOCATION> DULZURA </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> _ The death of a man apparently mauled by a pack of dogs could lead to a criminal investigation of the animals' owners, whose fearful neighbors had complained about marauding dogs, the sheriff's office said Preliminary findings of the autopsy Wednesday will be available Thursday morning, but if it attributes 69-year-old <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s death to the dogs, the criminal probe would ensue, Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenwolde </PERSON> said Wednesday `` A lot of questions need to be asked before we can speculate about what the outcome is going to be,'' <PERSON> Tenwolde </PERSON> said. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was attacked near the <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranch </PERSON>, where the dogs apparently lived, while he was walking to work. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> was unavailable for comment, but his wife, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>, said: `` It has never happened before. I ca n't imagine what happened.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Delany </PERSON>, caretaker of the <LOCATION> Monahan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> worked, found the body after driving to pick up his newspaper at his mailbox off the highway. `` It was unbelievable,'' <PERSON> Delany </PERSON> said. `` He appeared to have been eaten alive. That's the only way to describe it. He was eaten alive. I just knew he was gone.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Slough </PERSON>, an off-duty <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> policeman who lives nearby, went to investigate what he thought was a dogfight and found two dogs picking at the body. They attacked him and he shot and killed one and wounded another, police said. <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazzard </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said seven dogs licensed to <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> had been impounded. <PERSON> Hazzard </PERSON> said the dog wounded by <PERSON> Slough </PERSON> was being treated by department veterinarians. She said all the dogs would remain in department custody. `` The department has had contacts with Mr. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> and his dogs prior to the unfortunate incident and all documentation relative to those contacts have been forwarded to the sheriff's homicide unit,'' <PERSON> Hazzard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had complained in the past about the unrestrained dogs and family members said he had been bitten on at least one other occassion. His friends and relatives also said the dogs' owners have refused repeated requests to keep their pets fenced in or on leashes. <PERSON> Muriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, a neighbor, said she no longer walks along the dirt roads because of the dogs. `` Those dogs were so vicious that, even when they were behind a fence, my dogs panicked,'' <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> said. `` I had to give up my walks because those dogs were so threatening.'' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> police investigator <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomonsen </PERSON>, who is married to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s niece, <PERSON> Deanne </PERSON>, said the dogs often run in a pack of six to 12, menacing neighbors and passers-by. <PERSON> Delany </PERSON> said: `` The dogs always chase my truck, and they've attacked me on my horse.

The investigation has lasted four years. Since January, the probe has resulted in 22 people being indicted or pleading guilty. <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>'s former chief bingo inspector, W.D. `` Donnie'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, is serving a seven-year federal prison sentence on a conviction that includes extorting payoffs from bingo operators.

 Lawmakers on Wednesday approved a bill affirming President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s emergency powers after last week's failed coup but limiting them to three months and rejecting some tough measures proposed to restore order. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> declared an indefinite state of emergency Dec. 6 and this week asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to grant specific powers under the declaration. The bill approved Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> limits the powers to 90 days. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version could extend them up to six months. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will resume debate on its version Thursday. Renegade troops surrendered their last stronghold Saturday after at least 113 people died in the rebellion that began Dec. 1. However, authorities say about half the estimated 3,000 troops who took part in the coup attempt are still at large. Both congressional bills would let authorities search for weapons and ammunition in private homes without normal legal constraints. But searches and seizures would be `` in the context of constitutional guarantees'' under the House version, meaning a warrant would be required, Rep. <PERSON> Edcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagman </PERSON>, sponsor of the amendment, said. Another amendment says measures to put down the rebellion must be `` within the protection of the bill of rights.'' The House Rules Committee, dominated by pro-administration stalwarts, proposed a six-month emergency period and its section on searches and seizures did not refer to constitutional guarantees or the bill of rights. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted against letting Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> intervene in labor disputes and suspend labor laws. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version would keep the provision, which critics regard as a virtual ban on strikes. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said she needed stronger powers to search for weapons and rebels still at large. Business groups asked for curbs on strikes to enhance confidence among investors. Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> denounced Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s emergency decree as a move toward dictatorship. Former human rights lawyer Sen. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Saguisag </PERSON> defended it because of the coup attempt. Emergency powers also could be used in extending the lease on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and approving them would have `` dire implications'' for civil liberties, said <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, a defense minister and martial law administrator under President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> from 1972 to 1981. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> broke with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and joined a popular uprising that installed Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> as president in February 1986 and drove <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> into exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where he died. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> later joined the opposition to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said Wednesday that rebels who attempted the coup were still capable of staging terror attacks and assassinations. He said the government will no longer seek <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air cover over <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> territory. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jets flew `` persuasion flights'' to discourage more bombing runs on the <LOCATION> Malacanang </LOCATION> presidential palace and the military headquarters by rebel aircraft, turning the tide in favor of the government on the first day of the mutiny.

 A communist congress endorsed a multiparty system and free elections for <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> Wednesday, opening the way for a non-communist government in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s second-largest republic for the first time in 44 years The congress also elected <PERSON> Ivica </PERSON> <PERSON> Racan </PERSON>, 49, as new leader of the Croatian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Racan </PERSON>, who has publicly advocated radical democratic reforms within communist <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, received 41 votes in a secret ballot in the Central Committee. The only other candidate, <PERSON> Ivo </PERSON> <PERSON> Druzic </PERSON>, received 29 votes. <PERSON> Dragutin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimitrovic </PERSON>, a member of the party's decision-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the party by its actions `` is showing its readiness to put its platform to the public for approval.'' Twelve burgeoning political opposition movements already exist in the central Yugoslav republic and seek official legalization. Parliamentary elections are scheduled in April. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is in its worst crisis since the communists consolidated power in 1945. The question of pluralism instead of continued one-party rule is straining already tenuous ties between some republics and a moribund economy heightens tensions. The liberal northern republic of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> was until now the only of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six constituent regions to openly advocate introduction of Western-style democracy. The communist leadership of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, the largest republic, vehemently opposes introduction of a multiparty system both in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> and federally.

 A special panel on drug trafficking charged Wednesday that the daughter of the defense minister and her husband were involved in the cocaine trade. The commission said <PERSON> Tania </PERSON> <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON>, daughter of Defense Minister <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, and her husband, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mateo </PERSON>, smuggled U.S.-bound cocaine into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in electrical appliances from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The panel said she `` took advantage'' of her well-known name to bring the drug-laden items into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> without interference from airport authorities. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Coello </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said her whereabouts are not known and she is presumed to have fled the country. <PERSON> Mateo </PERSON> had been arrested in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and handed over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. However, he was later freed for lack of evidence. The defense minister's stepbrother and a former ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, ex-Col. <PERSON> Rigoberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>, is serving a 10-year sentence in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for cocaine trafficking <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> was arrested at the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> airport on May 15 with 25 pounds of cocaine in his suitcase. He was dismissed from the armed forces and stripped of his diplomatic status. `` <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has been a transit point for U.S.-bound narcotics since the last part of the 1970s,'' the panel said. It said Honduran authorities confiscated 18,480 pounds of Colombian cocaine from 1984 to 1988. It said `` a favorite technique'' of drug traffickers has been to buy influence from military leaders with costly gifts and business partnerships. The report was the first from the nine-person commission created in June by the legislature. The results of the ongoing inquiry are to be handed over to judicial officials.

 An electrician who slept on the streets after losing his job and his family said he won a position as a teacher at a technical school because he refused to give up hope. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Delano </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 42, said he learned where to get free coffee and find shelter while living on the street, but kept thinking there must be a way out. `` I can still remember that I wanted to find a job. But how? I stunk and was dirty,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said recently. `` Who in his right mind would hire me? `` I finally went to a shelter because I knew the people who ran them knew how to help me get back on my feet.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is n't homeless any more. He learned new skills through Jubilee Soup Kitchen's career development program, and teaches commercial and residential electrical installation at <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said he found his life going into a tailspin after returning to his native <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, in 1984 from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION>, where he'd worked as an electrician for years. His electrical contracting business in <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> failed, and a breakup with his wife, June, followed. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> almost three years ago because he had relatives in the city, but said he was unable to break into the skilled electrician's field. `` Then, when I filled out applications for lower paying jobs, they would look at my trade experience and tell me I was overqualified,'' he said. `` I finally got some odd jobs through a temporary job placement service by lying on my application and saying that my only skill was as a dishwasher.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> took his first step back when a caseworker introduced him to Jubilees' 12-week career program. He was offered the job at <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> even though he had no teaching experience. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s positive attitude was a deciding factor when he hired him to start work Oct. 2. `` He was n't mad at the world because of what happened to him,'' he said. `` He just wanted to put it all behind him and get on again with his life.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said he's trying to restore relationships with his sons _ <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, 23; <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, 20; and <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, 18 _ all in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> after losing touch with them. `` It's hard for me to pick up my relationships with them again because I'll have to tell them what happened to me,'' he said. `` That's hard.''

 A <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> woman accused of storing arms in her garden for leftist rebels returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Wednesday night after being freed from prison and deported from war-ravaged <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think I've suffered as terribly as thousands of Salvadorans have suffered here,'' <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, 28, said in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> before boarding a commercial flight to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> 2 -LCB- weeks after she was jailed on terrorism charges. Accompanied by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Comalapa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> insisted on her innocence when she was allowed to speak briefly with a few pool reporters. She said she signed a release statement acknowledging she was arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of having stored weapons and ammunition for rebels, but added, `` My position was always that I was innocent.'' <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> said she believed her release supports that contention. She telephoned her parents in <LOCATION> Thomaston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, from the airport. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said she told `` them she'll be home for Christmas.'' He also said she had expressed the desire to return to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> someday. `` She sounded confident, her voice was loud and clear,'' said her mother, <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, after talking with her daughter. `` She sounded like a happy person. She said she loved me very much.'' President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said earlier there was not enough evidence to continue holding Casolo. She was released into the custody of the ambassador, who picked her up in a black Cadillac escorted by Jeeps on Wednesday at the women's prison at <LOCATION> Ilopango </LOCATION> on the eastern outskirts of the capital. The caravan went to the airport and entered through a restricted entrance. Reporters were not allowed access either at the prison or airport. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> was put on an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and ushered to an undisclosed location upon her arrival, said the Rev. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminars </ORGANIZATION>, who traveled with her on the plane. `` It was a very emotional time for her, being taken straight from the prison to the airport and deported, because of her love for the people and the country of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. She decided late Wednesday to remain in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and not return immediately to her home in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, according to staffers for Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., who has followed the case Her travel plans beyond that were undecided, but church officials at the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> news conference said <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> planned to hold a news conference sometime Thursday. In <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, friends and well-wishers in her hometown prepared for her homecoming. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, a close high school friend of Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s, put up a sign on the town green that said, `` Welcome Home, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>. We Love You.'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> told a news conference he thought Casolo probably had cooperated with rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, who have fought U.S.-supported governments for 10 years and launched a major urban offensive in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> last month. `` I am morally convinced that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> is guilty,'' he said. The case against <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> will proceed and she was asked to remain available in case judicial authorities need to question her further, <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said. `` Evidence _ be it incriminating or exculpating _ will continue to be gathered,'' the president said. `` If the evidence against her becomes sufficient, she will be summoned to return for trial.'' He acknowledged that little could be done to make her come back to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Casolo and two Salvadoran friends were arrested Nov. 26 in a police raid on her house. She was charged with terrorism, possessing weapons of war and criminal association, all of which she denied. There was no immediate word on the cases against those two Salvadorans. In the walled garden behind the house, police said, they dug up 103 mortar shells, 213 blocks of dynamite, 405 detonators, 150 feet of slow-burning fuse and 21,945 rounds of ammunition for Soviet-made automatic rifles. She said she did not know how the materiel got into the yard of her rented home on the northwestern edge of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> denied his rightist administration was pressured to free Casolo by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the key financial supporter of his government. `` The judge's decision to release her is strictly judicial,'' he said. `` It is a political decision that we have made to deport her.'' Judge <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> of the criminal court handled the case. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said he spoke with Sen. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, who telephoned several times to ask about the case, but `` at no time did Sen. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> try to exert pressure. Indeed, his position was that, if there was sufficient proof against her, her trial should go forward.'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said earlier Wednesday he was told in telephone conversations with Salvadoran officials, including <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, that Casolo would be freed and expelled by Thursday afternoon. A statement issued by his office said <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> `` informs me that the judge in her case has ultimately concluded the charges against <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> were not fully supported by the evidence, and that she could not thus be fairly prosecuted under Salvadoran law.'' <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> spent five years in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, working for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminars </ORGANIZATION>, which organizes tours for Americans to learn about the civil war. <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibarra </PERSON>, her defense lawyer, filed a writ Monday requesting her release for lack of evidence. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said the judge ruled favorably on the writ. Her last <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residence was in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wash </LOCATION>, said Wednesday: `` I am glad for <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>'s sake that she has been released because there were serious questions about the ability of the Salvadoran judicial system to provide her a fair trial. `` There are many individuals who do not have the benefit of so many friends in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Our relief at <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>'s release must not diminish our concern for the many other church workers she leaves behind.''

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Rule Out Marcos Liability in Wrongful-Death Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge Wednesday refused to remove the late <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> from liability in a lawsuit that accuses him of heading an anti-opposition network that led to the killings of two political foes. The ruling meant closing arguments will go as scheduled Thursday in the 3-week-old trial, which claims Silme Domingo and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON> were fatally shot June 1, 1981, because their anti-Marcos activities drew the attention of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> intelligence agents. The Marcoses' attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON>, had asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON> to order a directed verdict in favor of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his widow, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, removing the case from the jury hearing the case. Other defendants in the case had opted to have <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON> judge their liability. Dr. <PERSON> Leonilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Malabed </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> friend who allegedly maintained a slush fund that paid $ 15,000 for the murders, asked <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON> to dismiss him from the case, as did the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON> did not immediately rule on the motions for <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, Malabed or the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> said. Three men were convicted of the murders on the theory that <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON> were victims of an internal union dispute in the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cannery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. Both were union officers. The two victim's survivors have brought the wrongful-death lawsuit, which seeks $ 30 million in damages. <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Malabed </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfieri </PERSON>, had asked <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON> to end the case against their clients on grounds that the plaintiffs had failed to show any direct link between their clients and the murders. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, a local attorney for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> government, said he asked for dismissal under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. Under the act, government agents' actions must be within the scope of their employment for the government to be liable, he said. The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> argues that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' actions against his opponents were done for his personal gain, <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said, not on behalf of the country from which he fled upon his overthrow in February 1986.

 <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayburgh </PERSON>, as a strong-willed soap opera producer, rashly decides to fight back when a psychopathic computer hacker undermines her life in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> movie `` Fear Stalk.'' Her character, <PERSON> Ally </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON>, shuns the advice of friends and battles this dangerous man on his own terms. `` He steals her purse and belongings and gets the information he needs to tap into her life through the computer,'' said <PERSON> Clayburgh </PERSON>. `` He takes her money, he victimizes her. Then, against advice, she fights back. It escalates into a deadly competition. He's never been challenged before.'' `` Fear Stalk'' also stars <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Macht </PERSON> as her boyfriend and the soap's director, and <PERSON> Sada </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> as her mother. It will be telecast Sunday. `` Ally has computers in her office and home,'' said <PERSON> Clayburgh </PERSON>. `` The scripts for the soap opera come in to her by computer. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Weston </PERSON>, who wrote the movie, worked in soaps while she put herself through law school. She creates an interesting milieu. She creates a sort of parallel between what's going on on the soap opera and what's happening to me.'' Early in her career, <PERSON> Clayburgh </PERSON> worked on the soap opera `` Search For Tomorrow.'' `` It's so hard to learn all those lines,'' she said. `` But for my first six months I was in bed and communicated only by blinking my eyes. I had been in an accident. When I finally came out of the coma, I kept saying, ` Oh, thank you, doctor. Thank you for saving my life.' The cast and crew called me ` Grateful Grace.'''

<HEAD>New `CBS This Morning' Producer Has Difficult Mission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> recently became the second executive producer `` CBS This Morning'' has had since its debut on Nov. 30 two years ago. He has what some consider the morning version of `` Mission Impossible.'' Like its previous incarnations, the two-hour program remains a distant third in ratings against <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' Like his precedessors on past and current <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> morning shows, <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> is expected to change that. `` I do n't think it's impossible,'' says <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON>, 33, a former vice president of <ORGANIZATION> CBS-owned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> KCBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` I think it's tough, though. That it is. <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> figures for last month's important ratings sweeps _ local stations use the results to set advertising rates _ gave <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Morning'' a 2.5 ratings average, well behind the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> shows; they were tied with a 4.4. Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes. But the Nielsens contained a ray of hope for the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> reveille team of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. The ratings were up two-tenths of a point from those of the previous November. Tiny, yes, but a start. To improve on that, <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON>, in the custom of new producers, plans some changes: a different musical arrangement of the show's theme music; more ratings-boosting travel, and what he calls `` more visual variety. No costly new set, a staple of arriving executive producers, is planned by <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Waukegan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, native whose background is in local news. But he is trying to get `` name'' contributors on various topics, among them Chicago-based movie critic <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Siskel </PERSON>, best known from the syndicated `` <ORGANIZATION> Siskel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Ebert </PERSON> `` film-review series. Others contributors, he says, would report on parenting, science, the environment and aging. In addition to his plans to rely more heavily on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> correspondents, he has hired two new full-time staffers, features reporter <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> and Hollywood-based entertainment reporter <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Kmetko </PERSON>. And, in a move that got his show some publicity last week, he hired <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>, the brother of `` Today'' co-host <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>, to do sports segments and occasional fill-in anchoring on `` CBS This Morning.'' But <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> does n't think his show will get a swarm of disaffected `` Today'' viewers next month when <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>, after 13 years on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s show, yields her co-host chair there to <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Norville </PERSON>. `` Certainly <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> has a big following, and her departure is undoubtedly going to cause some of her followers to look around at what else is available,'' he says. But he theorizes that `` Good Morning America'' would be the chief beneficiary of any `` Today'' viewer defection simply because it has been on since 1975 and, like its <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> rival, is a place of relative stability. CBS, in contrast, still is trying to get back morning viewers who, after all the years of change, may have given up on it, he says: `` I think a lot of viewers do n't realize that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> is a viable alternative here. And so, I do n't think we would stand to gain as much from this -LRB- <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>'s exit -RRB- as perhaps GMA will. But I think we certainly stand to gain.'' Reassurances of stability in CBS' morning effort might help aid its cause. No doubt for that reason, <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> has been downplaying <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s unusually frank comment last October on `` Donahue'' that `` my days are numbered'' if her show's ratings do n't improve. Asked if she and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> will continue as anchors all next year on `` CBS This Morning,'' <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> immediately replied, `` Yes.'' He laughed when advised that constitutes a ringing endorsement in network TV today. He also added qualifying comments. The anchor team of <ORGANIZATION> Sullivan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> will remain `` to the extent'' that he has control of the situation. `` Obviously, there are forces and factors out there in the world that could change that,'' he said. `` I suppose that if for some reason, the show started bleeding ... and we started doing a 1.4 -LRB- rating -RRB- for 12 weeks in a row, somebody would have to say, ` Wait a minute, there's a mistake somewhere ...' `` But it's our intention to stay the course, stick with what we've got, and improve on the program.''

<HEAD>Kenyan Woman Battles Plan for 60-Story Building in People's Park</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIDRIKKE SCHANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The ruling political party's plan to put up <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s tallest building in a park set aside 26 years ago for the common man stirred enough outrage in environmentalist <PERSON> Wangari </PERSON> <PERSON> Maathai </PERSON> that she went to court to stop it. That raised the hackles of Parliament _ which held her action to be tantamount to suing the head of state _ and the court eventually threw the case out as lacking merit. But not before the issue raised a public outcry rarely seen in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. Officials found themselves accused of being irresponsible, insensitive and unaccountable. Soon after independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1963, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s first president, <PERSON> Jomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyatta </PERSON>, dedicated the 10-acre park on the edge of <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> for the use of everyday Kenyans. He called it <LOCATION> Uhuru </LOCATION> _ Swahili for freedom. Today the park is an oasis that offers an inexpensive respite for <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>'s thousands of day laborers. Many of them, lacking money for lunch, use the park for what sarcastically is known as an `` airburger'' _ a lunch-hour nap. After plans for the park were announced by the <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's only legal political party, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> arap </PERSON> <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> allowed debate to go on for a little more than a month. Then he assailed the building's critics as having `` insects in their head'' and told them to `` shut up.'' His order silenced most of the building's detracters. Not Mrs. <PERSON> Maathai </PERSON>. She went to court despite <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s threats to have her <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> tree-planting organization banned. The park has a processional, a pond with recreational row boats, walkways and tiered levels for relaxing and picknicking; it provides a getaway for the `` wananchi'' -LRB- common people -RRB- living in the crowded neighborhoods and slums ringing the city. Scores of citizens in letters printed by <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s two independent newspapers pleaded with the government to put the complex elsewhere. They, like Mrs. <PERSON> Maathai </PERSON>, have been dismissed as ignorant and subversive by the government's most vocal stalwarts in a country where views contrary to the official position are strongly discouraged. In a letter to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mwangi </PERSON> wrote: `` I use the park with my family most weekends. I see people there who have no other forms of recreation, with their families, men with wives and barefoot children but happy to have those moments of tranquility when they can forget the struggle of daily living. ... `` Please have a care for the wananchi. We are already suffering from other problems.'' <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s leaders maintain the project will lend prestige to what already is one of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most developed and prosperous cities and will provide thousands of needed jobs. Critics do n't dispute these aspects of the project; they say they just want the building moved to one of the other vast open areas surrounding the city. The complex, which is expected to cost $ 197 million and take about four years to complete, will include a 60-story main tower with a four-story statue of President <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> in front, two 10-story wings, an auditorium, parking for 2,000 people, and conference facilities for 5,000 people, even though a conference center already exists just a quarter of a mile from the proposed site. In a public statement, the <ORGANIZATION> Architectural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> protested putting the project in the park. It contended the building will destroy the grassy belt on <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>'s perimeter that earned the metropolis the name `` <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in the Sun.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Maathai </PERSON> has earned the most vehement and vitriolic condemnation from Parliament for her outspoken criticism of the building, which has continued despite the president's directive for people like her to shut up. Mrs. <PERSON> Maathai </PERSON> initially was reviled for her protests in letters to individual members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the British high commissioner -LRB- ambassador -RRB- and the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> media magnate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, who owns a share of the ruling party's media interests. She also called on the people of <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> to `` stand up and raise their voices.'' She drew even harsher rebukes for seeking a court injunction to bar construction of the complex. Members of Parliament assailed her 12-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> as bogus and subversive. On Dec. 11, the High Court dismissed her suit _ a `` non-starter from the date of filing.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Maathai </PERSON>, who before the ruling accused the court of being more concerned with `` politics than law,'' said she was disappointed in the decision but would appeal it to the attorney general's office. `` The most important thing is to rise and express one's opinion and say no when you should say no,'' she said. `` If we are not listened to then at least we have done what we could do within our own constraints.''

<TEXT>
 The fingerprints of an old <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> hand are showing. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s overtures toward an unbending government in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> are in line with the policy recommended by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, who reopened the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> door to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> 17 years ago. In person and in memo, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> has urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to keep it ajar despite the deadly crackdown against democracy demonstrators, a Chinese hard line that remains in force. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent two senior administration officials to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last weekend, taking the first step toward repairing relations. He defended the mission against a wave of Democratic criticism, and some Republican skeptics, by saying that isolating <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would only make things worse. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> six weeks ago, the first prominent American visitor to confer with officials there since the government clampdown that began with the massacre in Tiananmen Square on June 4. The former president then urged steps on both sides to improve relations, and recommended exactly the kind of official mission <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> then ordered. The people and the policy involved in the controversial gesture to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> are testament to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s role as a central figure in U.S.-China relations for nearly two decades, a role that survived his Watergate downfall. Directly or indirectly, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> has influenced <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> policy since the era of pingpong diplomacy 20 years ago, prior to his breakthrough presidential journey to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1972. In 1974, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser and senior man on the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> mission, was a deputy to <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> when he was national security adviser in the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> White House. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> went secretly to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to prepare for <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s 1972 trip. Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Egleburger </PERSON>, the other half of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mission, also is a one-time <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> aide. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, the former secretary state, also visited <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> this fall, and returned saying that the Chinese should not be isolated. That was the administration theme as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his spokesmen defended the Scowcroft journey, while acknowledging that the Chinese had done nothing to moderate their crackdown on dissenters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> know they will have to address human rights concerns to fully repair relations. `` But I do n't want to see that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> remains totally isolated,'' the president said Monday after <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> returned and briefed him on the weekend mission. `` ... There has not been normalization of relations because Gen. <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, at my request _ and it was my idea, my suggestion _ went over there and had very high level talks in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. But the Scowcroft visit included some of the trappings of normal relations, including a state dinner and exchange of toasts with typically flowery words about cooperation and friendship. The Chinese apparently got to orchestrate the visit, the schedule and the way it was announced, at 2 a.m. on a snowy Saturday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The timing of the announcement was that the Chinese asked that we not announce it until they arrived in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> HousepPress </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. While the White House said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s economic and diplomatic sanctions against the Chinese remain in place, they appear to have been eased before the Scowcroft mission, with earlier top-level contacts and with business dealings. `` The president suspended the export of military weapons and defense articles to the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but did not intend to disrupt normal civilian commercial relations,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said A suspension of international development bank loans remains in effect. Scowcroft's assignment was said to be to brief Chinese leaders on the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> meetings between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He also was said to have expressed continuing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern over the crackdown. But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the trip was not prompted by Chinese concessions or internal changes. He said both <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> had urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to seek renewed contacts with top Chinese officials. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> discussed his <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> visit with the president and his top advisers, including <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, at a White House dinner early in November. He also gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> an 18-page written report on his meetings with Chinese leaders and his views on the way relations might be improved. In a version he later made public, the former president said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a strong strategic interest in closer ties with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and suggested that the suspension of high level contacts had even then served its purpose in venting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> outrage at the <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> crackdown. Isolation, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said, would only strengthen reactionary forces in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` ... The administration should consider taking one step on its own now, the resumption of contacts between high level administration officials and Chinese officials,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> advised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a month ago. `` Such an action should not require the Chinese to act first ...'' That's what happened. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Democratic critics, who deemed the original sanctions inadequate, now accuse him of bending, wavering and kowtowing to the Chinese. There are suggestions that they may vote for tougher sanction laws next year. The political backlash over the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gesture will depend in large part on what <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> does now. `` The stickiest question is who goes first,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> had said in his <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> memo. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did.

<HEAD>Workers Will Want More in 1990, Says Chamber</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Losing the fight to prevent an increase in the minimum wage has left the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in a somewhat sullen mood about the immediate economic consequences. It will, the chamber says, result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of job opportunities, ignite a new round of wage inflation, raise the deficit, compromise <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitiveness and force some companies to forego expansion. The chamber was in the forefront of opposition to the increase, which takes the hourly minimum to $ 4.25 from $ 3.35, and it still smarts from the defeat, saying it resulted when `` sound economics fell victim to political expediency.'' More recently it expressed its ire in The Business Advocate, a monthly newspaper delivered to members and opinion leaders, saying the inrease will have a ripple effect on workers in higher-paying jobs. `` When wages at one level increase, employees at higher levels place a new and greater value on their services,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, director of the chamber's Employee Relations Policy Center. He said numerous studies concur in his finding that the increase will cost jobs. He cited one by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> that indicated between 125,000 and 800,000 jobs would be lost if the rate were raised to $ 4.55 as once proposed. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agreed, however, to a lesser increase, bringing the minimum to $ 3.80 on April 1, 1990 and to $ 4.25 one year later. It also permits a lower, short-term training wage for some teenagers. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> cites a 1981 report by the <ORGANIZATION> Minimum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, named by former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, that found that each 10 percent increase in the minimum wage has the potential to raise the nation's payroll by 0.76 percent. Since the new law will raise the wage 27 percent, the Business Advocate article concludes that labor costs will rise by about 2.05 percent, or more than $ 46 billion. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> did express satisfaction that `` though we lost the last battle, we saved businesses more than $ 9 billion by holding off a wage increase for the past three years,'' and that it helped push through a training wage. The latter, opposed by organized labor, will allow employers to pay a lower minimum wage for three months to first-time workers under age 20. The training wage of $ 3.35 would begin April 1, 1990, rising to $ 3.61 a year later. While the minimum wage puts a base under minimum wages in much of the nation, it is already exceeded in other areas, with some food outlets already paying $ 6 an hour or even more for unskilled workers. The chamber article did n't address another criticism of the higher minimum, one made by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s business school, that the increases might not be as effective as believed in reducing poverty levels. <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> testified during hearings held prior to the law's signing on Nov. 17 that many earning the minimum are not primary breadwinners in their families but instead are relatively comfortable people earning second incomes Regardless of who gets the minimum wage, and the automatic increases that lift it over the next two years, the chamber said it expects those earning above the minimum are likely, as a consequence of the law, to want more. `` Expect wage pressure,'' it warned.

 The crater of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, the deepest, most visible scar on the town where it fell, is disappearing under new homes. At the end of November, contractors began building 11 houses in <LOCATION> Sherwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crescent </LOCATION> where the falling wreckage of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 killed 11 residents of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> last Dec. 21, the final deaths of a terrorist bombing that killed the 259 passengers and crew of Flight 103. `` Some people needed an awful lot of sustaining just to get to this week,'' said <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON>, who directs a team of social workers in the town. `` The frustration that it has taken so long to rebuild has been very great, crushing for some people. Others have little interest, because they do n't really want to go back, but feel they have to go back because so much effort has been put in by so many people.'' The crater has been filled and the street restored. Burnt shells of houses have been pulled down, and only muddy vacant lots betray the extent of the destruction. The construction reflects the determination to wipe out all traces of the disaster. Along the sidewalk of <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Crescent </PERSON>, however, a lone pot of flowers testifies to a town torn between remembrance and forgetting. <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> lost its quiet obscurity just after 7:03 that cold Wednesday night, when explosives hidden in a radio-cassette recorder shattered the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet `` Maid of the Seas.'' At 36 seconds past 7:03, the <ORGANIZATION> Eskdalemuir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> 15 miles from <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> recorded seismic shocks, apparently caused by the falling wreckage. The main part of the fuselage, with enough jet fuel to push a 747 from <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, exploded in <LOCATION> Sherwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crescent </LOCATION>. Shattered metal and flaming fuel spewed over dozens of houses, and debris blocked traffic on the four-lane north-south highway. A forward portion of the fuselage landed across town in <LOCATION> Rosebank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crescent </LOCATION>. The plane's nose fell 3 miles from town, across the road from the stone church at <LOCATION> Tundergarth </LOCATION>. `` The night it happened, one of the first things I saw was the body of a child hanging in a tree,'' said <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, who lives in the <LOCATION> Rosebank </LOCATION> area. `` That child will never leave me.'' The town's population of 3,500 nearly doubled with the influx of a thousand police officers, 700 military personnel, 500 other volunteer and support workers, and hundreds of reporters, photographers and camera crews. Sheep now graze placidly where the plane's nose fell and the two shattered houses in <ORGANIZATION> Rosebank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> have been rebuilt, but the memories remain. `` When you think the number of houses -LRB- in <LOCATION> Rosebank </LOCATION> -RRB- that face in that small area where 61 bodies were found ... there must be more than a hundred people who could not avoid seeing that mayhem,'' <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelling </PERSON>, assistant director of social work for the <LOCATION> Dumfries </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Galloway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, recalled one family that `` identified with the young boy that was lying in their garden for two days _ they started grieving for him, they wanted to know his name.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, whose home was 120 yards from the <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Crescent </PERSON> crater, brought his family back to the house two days after the disaster. `` We wanted back in, to settle the kids if nothing else,'' he said. Repairs put them out of the house for six weeks, however, and it was 10 months before the job was complete. But they never thought of moving, he said. Before talking with a reporter, <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> shooed his daughters out of the parlor. Talk of the disaster upsets them, he said, and with the onset of winter he realized his older daughter, now 5, had become afraid of the dark. `` We do talk about it with them on their own. They understand what happened,'' he said. In the months after the disaster, some adults as well as children had difficulty sleeping, <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON> said. `` There were reports of children not sleeping or having nightmares or playing what their parents thought were rather bizarre, unsavory games _ playing airplanes and crashing them and so on,'' he said. `` But that's definitely understandable, and people were encouraged to understand that was OK, that it was a way of dealing with it.'' He said there have been no reports of children developing serious behavioral problems. `` I think the people with the serious and lasting problems are in the uniformed services ... just because of what they had to do in the recovery of bodies,'' <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON> said. The torn bodies reawakened some men's memories of combat service, in one case going back to World War I, he said. For some women, the disaster brought back moments of great personal loss _ of a husband, a child or parents. `` One of the things you hear people say is that they do n't feel safe anymore. If it happened once it can happen again,'' <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON> said. `` Some of them are quite unable to use public transport _ buses or trains. Airplanes are just out of the question.'' <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON> said some residents have admitted fearing the dark, or the noise of a passing truck or express train. When one <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> man took a train to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, his wife kept the television on all day expecting news of a rail disaster. Reflecting on the work in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pelling </PERSON> talks about `` the timelessness of disaster'' for survivors. `` It is there, it has happened, it is always going to be there,'' he said. `` While they desperately want to get this episode behind them and feel they are going forward, they are not going to be able to shake off the night of the 21st in quite as easy terms.'' Agencies that came to help are thinking now of leaving. `` I think we should melt away. We're another scar of the disaster,'' said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON>, who directs the Community Support office set up by the regional council. <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON>'s office runs by two clocks, one set on <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> because some of its contacts are with authorities and insurors in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as well as with relatives of the American victims. The approach of the anniversary made memories unavoidable. On the afternoon of Dec. 21, the town will dedicate a monument in the Dryfesdale Cemetery bearing the names of the 270 dead. A memorial service will be held that night outside the town hall, used a year ago as a temporary mortuary. Some <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> relatives of victims plan to attend. `` We're hoping that after the 21st we can get back and have our town to ourselves,'' said <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Moloney </PERSON>, who works with a childrens' group formed after the disaster. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a member of the district council, agreed. `` I think they see it as a watershed, a time for looking forward again. I think people hope -LRB- the anniversary -RRB- will be an end to the media attention.''

 The wrenching disaster of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 had an unexpected side effect for this small market town. The rebuilding effort has given residents the impetus to push for some renewal projects. Beyond paying to rebuild destroyed homes and other essential repairs, the local government has borrowed money to refurbish dozens of units of public housing. Residents also pushed for better lights and street repairs, and got them. And now they are pressing plans for a park on the site of an abandoned factory. `` We just took a good look at ourselves and decided we were being badly done by,'' said <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, vice chairman of a residents committee in the <LOCATION> Rosebank </LOCATION> area. `` We're grasping the opportunity, because now the regional council is very sympathetic to requests from <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` I think they are things we should have pushed for years ago.''

<HEAD>Prescription Drug Abuse Down But Rules Hamper Some Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drug enforcement officials are declaring a partial victory in one battle of the war on drugs: the diversion of prescription drugs to the illicit market. Cases of prescription drug abuse reported to the national <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> have fallen by almost one-third since 1981. But some medical professionals say the tougher new rules are preventing effective treatment of many Americans with legitimate needs for such medication. In 1981, 131,618 incidents of pharmaceutical abuse were reported to the warning network, but by 1988 that number had dropped to 88,525, said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Haislip </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is the one part of the drug problem where we have made genuine progress and reduced the size of it,'' said <PERSON> Haislip </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s diversion control chief And yet, the diversion of legal drugs remains `` a very large problem,'' he said. Most frequently abused are the narcotic painkillers Percodan, Dilaudid and codeine; the stimulants amphetamine and <PERSON> Preludin </PERSON>, both prescribed for short-term treatment of obesity; the sedative Doriden; and tranquilizers such as Valium, <LOCATION> Librium </LOCATION>, Xanax and Diazepam. The profit potential in diverted drugs is huge. A single 4 milligram tablet of Dilaudid costs a bonafide patient about 60 cents but can sell on the street for as much as $ 60, <PERSON> Haislip </PERSON> says. He estimates that up to 15 percent of the 25 billion prescription pills and capsules manufactured legally each year wind up on the street. The drugs reach the black market through several routes: physicians who intentionally write unnecessary prescriptions, patients who convince doctors that they need the drugs when they do n't, pharmacies that falsify records and thefts from drug stores. The authorities' biggest weapons in the battle against diversions have been tighter regulation of physicians and pharmacies and monitoring of prescriptions. Some observers contend the requirements have made life more painful for patients with a legitimate need for frequently diverted drugs. `` Physicians go out of their way to avoid attracting the attention of regulatory agencies,'' write physicians <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON> in a new book, `` Drug Treatment of Cancer Pain in a Drug-Oriented Society.'' `` As a result, they underprescribe the dosage of opiates and fail to provide patients with prescriptions for drug quantities sufficient to cover a reasonable time interval, thus making frequent requests for resupply necessary,'' the doctors write. `` This prescribing behavior is humiliating for patients.'' Take the case of a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> minister highlighted in a documentary film by <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, who works at a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> cancer center. The Baptist minister, suffering from cancer and seeking a stronger painkiller from his doctor, was rebuffed as if he were an addict. `` You're a dope head and I'm going to dry you out while you're in here,'' the minister quoted his physician as saying In an interview, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> related the case of another patient who was receiving a toxic dose of acetaminophen because his docotor was prescribing it in combination with codeine rather than a stronger medication _ simply to avoid the scrutiny that attends prescriptions for the most frequently diverted painkillers. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Haislip </PERSON> said the federal regulation specifies that the legitimate treatment of pain should not be impeded. He rejected arguments that physicians are hesitant about prescribing necessary drugs, noting that morphine prescriptions rose 300 percent from 1982 to 1986. `` That's an enormous increase, but the statistics do not show any such comparable increase in diversion for that drug, which leads me to believe that it is for cancer and most all of it is legitimate,'' <PERSON> Haislip </PERSON> said. However, he acknowledged that some patients may have trouble finding pharmacies willing to carry certain controlled drugs. A recent nationwide survey found that only 38 percent of responding drug stores routinely stock an oral morphine preparation, in many cases because of fear of robbery. While some doctors shy away from prescribing the most potent drugs, a few others have made an illegal living from it. Officials cite the case of Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. He ran two weight-reduction clinics in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and `` was writing about 45 percent of the prescriptions for Preludin for the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>'' when arrested in 1982, said <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Prosecutor <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said at the time that investigators sent undercover agent <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, who is not overweight, to one clinic to buy the stimulant. `` <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> told him they would have to make it look legal, so <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> would have to bring four fat girls with him,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. `` He came back with the girls, all law enforcement officers, and got the prescriptions.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, originally indicted on 63 counts, pleaded guilty in a plea bargain to one count of illegally prescribing the drug. He lost his medical license and was sentenced to five years in prison, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. The federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 tightened the rules for those handling drugs with a potential for abuse. Such drugs are broken down into five categories, or schedules: _ Schedule I drugs, such as heroin, have the highest potential for abuse but no accepted medical use and can be used only for research _ Schedule II drugs are the most dangerous and subject to abuse This category includes Percodan, Dilaudid, morphine and some codeine formulations as well as amphetamines and Preludin. Federal regulations require that everyone who prescribes or handles Schedule II drugs register with the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>; that manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies complete special DEA forms on every transaction; that patients have a written prescription that can not be refilled; and that the drugs be kept in a safe by the manufacturer, importer and distributor _ but not the pharmacy. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> even sets production limits. _ Schedule III, IV and V drugs pose a lesser danger and are deemed less subject to abuse Doriden is a Schedule III drug and most tranquilizers are Schedule IV. Schedule V includes many over-the-counter narcotic preparations. Federal regulations for the Schedule III, IV and V drugs are increasingly lenient. Nine states have gone beyond federal rules, imposing a multiple-copy prescription system, with most of the states requiring the physician, the pharmacy and state officials to retain a copy of each prescription. Officials of the states _ <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ say such programs enable them to spot those who seem to be prescribing or dispensing inordinate amounts. All the state programs affect Schedule II drugs. Some include a few Schedule III drugs, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, citing an alarming number of prescriptions, recently added the Schedule IV sleeping pills and tranquilizers such as Valium and <LOCATION> Librium </LOCATION>. Officials say <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' multiple-copy program helped crack the case of Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, although the long lines outside his clinics in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nacogdoches </LOCATION> already had attracted law enforcement attention. The White House Conference for a Drug Free <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> recommended in June 1988 that all states establish such programs, and the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> supports them. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and some drug companies oppose the programs, citing concerns about patient care, among others. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, the pharmaceutical association's professional affairs director, said Schedule II prescriptions go down dramatically as soon as such programs are instituted, and that can hurt patients `` who truly do need large quantities of medication.''

 <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Houck </PERSON> have seen the drug war from the other side, fighting a sometimes futile battle to obtain painkillers for a 5-year-old daughter being destroyed by cancer. They raced to hospitals at all hours of the day and night to get prescriptions for morphine that were good only for 48 hours, searched the area for pharmacies that would risk the possibility of a break-in to carry the drug, and tried to comfort their terrified daughter when she asked the unanswerable question: `` Why does this have to happen to me?'' `` It is tragic enough to lose a child, but it's awful to live with the terror of her agony,'' <PERSON> Matilda </PERSON> said in an interview at her home in this <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, suburb. <PERSON> Kendra </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> <PERSON> Houck </PERSON> was born Oct. 28, 1983; she died March 3, 1989. A six-month failure by doctors to diagnose her neural blastoma meant that when it was discovered in August 1986, the only options left were experimental treatments. The doctors told the Houcks their only child would have had a good chance of recovery had the cancer been diagnosed earlier. Instead, for the next 2 -LCB- years, the family suffered through experimental treatments, enjoyed a 10-month remission, doled out dosages first of codeine and Demerol and later morphine, celebrated <PERSON> Kendra </PERSON>'s fifth birthday and learned all about the nation's drug laws. Two days after Halloween 1988, <PERSON> Kendra </PERSON>'s condition deteriorated dramatically. `` From that day on, it became morphine ... and even that was n't real effective,'' said <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> `` She would be screaming on morphine,'' said <PERSON> Matilda </PERSON>, a gentle woman whose voice wavered as she tried to restrain tears. `` It just was n't cutting the pain. She was conscious and in agony.'' By the time <PERSON> Kendra </PERSON> died, her eyes pressed open day and night by a brain tumor, she was taking more than 100 milligrams of morphine every four hours. To <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>, `` the real issue ... is access'' to morphine. The Houcks found that very few pharmacies carry the drug out of fear of robberies; those that do generally have very little on hand for the same reason. <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> said pharmacies refused to tell him over the phone whether they carried morphine because they feared a holdup. The prescriptions were good only for 48 hours, which meant that in times of need, they would race to <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to get one from the doctors who knew <PERSON> Kendra </PERSON>'s condition. But they could not get the morphine there because <PERSON> Kendra </PERSON> was at home, not in the hospital. Eventually, they found a pharmacist who knew their situation and would have the morphine ready when they needed it. He sold it to them at cost. Even then, the price was $ 494 for a typical three-day supply, <PERSON> Matilda </PERSON> said. `` I felt like the sick and dying are paying the price for our drug war,'' she said. These are not radical, anti-establishment people. They did not attempt illicit street buys of heroin for <PERSON> Kendra </PERSON>'s pain _ something experts say would not have helped her _ or marijuana for her nausea. `` That would have been an option to us had we chosen to do it in an outlaw way,'' <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> said, but it would have been `` 100 percent inconsistent'' with their lifestyle. In addition, he said, they were concerned how <PERSON> Kendra </PERSON>'s mix of drugs, had it included heroin or marijuana, would have affected her. Merely handling the morphine seemed odd to <LOCATION> Dewey </LOCATION>. `` It was strange to fool with this stuff that was verboten,'' he said. `` We had jugs full of it and we could not get enough'' for <PERSON> Kendra </PERSON>. After <PERSON> Kendra </PERSON> died, the nurse immediately cleared out all the leftover controlled substances, destroying them in the presence of another health-care professional. `` I did n't understand why I could n't just flush it down the toilet with the Valium'' he said.

<HEAD>Lexus LS 400: Comfort, and Delicious Attention to Detail</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The 1990 Lexus LS 400 is a car drivers will want to live in. I did. The LS 400 test car had better soundproofing than my apartment and an ambience several notches higher. It further beat out my abode by coming equipped with an automatic compact disc player, operating by remote control from the trunk. As a friend noted: `` This is a car that you would n't mind riding in, even if you had a horrendous commute. In fact, you'd look forward to it.'' Such is the calming influence of the Lexus, the first of a new breed of Japanese imports designed to lure buyers from such upscale European luxury cars as <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, BMW and <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>. Early indications are that the LS 400, the larger of the two Lexus models available, is a worthy competitor. `` Lexus transports you literally and figuratively into another dimension,'' says Car and Driver magazine. `` The car's smoothness and air of total integration is both a wonder and a delight.'' Automobile magazine says, `` Another master stroke from the land of the perfect machine.'' Both magazines have named the LS 400 one of their top 10 autos of the 1990 model year. What is so alluring about the LS 400? After all, on the outside, this Toyota product is understated. The rounded front end resembles that of a Mercedes. My first clue to the pampering offered by the LS 400 was the electronic steering wheel that automatically tilts and telescopes in or out to a pre-set position as the key fits into the ignition. The steering wheel also contains an airbag. Then came the whisper-soft startup. For the first couple of times, I needed to check the automatic lights on the test car's dashboard to confirm the engine had started On the road, the car was equally quiet. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> worked 18 months to develop a tire that meets <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s rigid standards for that peaceful ride. I also admired the smooth shifting of the four-speed, automatic overdrive transmission. I barely noticed as the powerful 32-valve, V8 engine and well-tuned transmission went through their paces. And the antilock brakes were the most sensitive I've encountered. Finally was the attention to detail. Front seats were wide and comfortable, with electronic controls for personal adjustments. Even the headrests were electronic. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> used a computer to study passengers' weight distribution so the seat design would ease fatigue. The height of the seatbelt anchors also were electronically adjustable, so shorter people do n't have to tolerate chafing at the neck; with the touch of a button, the belt could be lowered on the door post. The power window buttons were well-designed, to accommodate even long fingernails. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> had its engineers put on fake nails before deciding the final design of the window buttons. The premium sound system, with the remote CD player in the trunk, was superb. The changer holds six compact discs, selected before the drive begins, and is operated from the dashboard panel. A convenient two-cup holder popped out from the center armrest, and the spacious trunk contained a nifty first aid kit, complete with travel case, and an auto repair kit. The LS 400 is larger and more popular than the other Lexus model, the ES 250. Company spokeswoman <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiman </PERSON> said that of the more than 9,000 Lexus vehicles sold since the line was introduced in September, the majority are LS 400s. Target buyers are baby boomers entering their peak earning years, she said, noting that the number of Americans aged 35 to 65 will grow from 78 million to 94 million into the next decade. Household income of the Lexus buyers will be $ 50,000-plus, <PERSON> Weiman </PERSON> said. Early Lexus sales showed the interest of import owners. Among the first 1,000 buyers, 35 percent traded in European imports, while 20 percent traded in Japanese models, <PERSON> Weiman </PERSON> said. Twenty percent traded in domestic vehicles. In its competition with the European luxury cars, the Lexus has an advantage in price and a disadvantage as the new kid on the block. The LS 400 starts at $ 35,000, thousands less than the Mercedes 300E, at $ 39,950, and the lowest-priced <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>, the $ 39,700 XJ-6 four-door sedan. But Lexus does n't have the years of name recognition granted the <ORGANIZATION> BMW </ORGANIZATION>, Mercedes or <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> nameplates. That does not deter <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> from predicting sales of 16,000 Lexus cars this year, with sales next year set for 75,000. The LS 400 is a new vehicle, so Consumer Reports does not list owner complaints. But in early December, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> recalled all 8,000 LS 400s to fix a sticky cruise control mechanism and replace a defective stoplight cover that would melt if the light was left burning. In addition, Lexus mechanics were also to make sure a connector between the alternator and the battery was seated properly. If not clicked into place, battery power could be drained, Lexus spokesman <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> said.

 A weak advertising market for newspapers in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> is part of the reason for <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s declaration that it is unlikely to have higher operating earnings this year and for a big charge against fourth quarter earnings at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> executives told securities analysts on Tuesday that higher circulation costs at its <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper and a settlement of a legal dispute also figured in its projection of a possible decline in operating earnings for 1989 If operating earnings decline, it would be the first such drop at <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> since 1982. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 44 million charge against fourth quarter earnings, due to its investment in its forest products operation and estimated costs related to expected voluntary union staff cuts at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, its flagship newspaper. The staff cuts, which are expected to involve mainly production workers, were attributed to weak advertising volume in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> region and further automation of printing and production facilties. Analysts who follow the newspaper business have said they expect ad revenue growth for newspapers to remain sluggish next year, particularly in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> where the economy appears weaker than in other regions. Times Mirror, a media and information company based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, owns the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and several Eastern newspapers, including <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newsday </LOCATION>, The <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> Courant and the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> Sun newspapers. The company's earnings from operations were up 7 percent for the first nine months of 1989 to $ 1.62 a share from $ 1.58 a share a year earlier. But <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Erburu </PERSON>, the company's chairman and chief executive, told analysts at <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>'s 17th annual media conference that it was was unlikely the company would `` continue to show year-to-year improvement in operating earnings'' for the full year. <PERSON> Erburu </PERSON> cited the difficult operating environment facing the company's newspapers in the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION>, the costs of trying to sign up new subscribers after the Nov. 2 closing of the rival <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> and a $ 5 million settlement of a legal case involving <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION>'s cable TV operations. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Laventhol </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION>, said while the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> was turning in a `` solid year'' with increases in both retail and classified advertising, the company's Eastern papers were reporting ad revenues barely even with a year ago, with classified advertising lineage down 7 percent. For 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 331.9 million, or $ 2.58 a share, on revenue of $ 3.33 billion. Operating earnings amounted to $ 2.27 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> said it has stepped up its cost-containment program to offset some of the volatile economic and market conditions expected next year. `` We have good reason to believe that we can show improvement in 1990 barring an economic downturn,'' <PERSON> Erburu </PERSON> said. In addition to newspapers and cable operations, <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> owns four television stations and publishes magazines and books. In a news release Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said 35 cents of its 57 cent per share charge in the fourth quarter stemmed from a determination that it would not fully recover an equity investment in its forest products operation. The market for newsprint has been glutted with supply. The remaining 22 cents per share of the charge stemmed from estimated expenses of voluntary union staff reductions at The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The company has been in talks with its printers and plans to talk with other unions for production workers about staff reductions, spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> said. The reductions stem from weak advertising volume in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> region and automation of newspaper production in the composing room, the planned closing of a printing facility at <LOCATION> Carlstadt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and the opening of an automated printing and distribution facility in <LOCATION> Edison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, in late 1990. The company did not estimate earnings for the fourth quarter ending Dec. 31. For the first nine months of 1989, the company earned $ 285.6 million, or $ 3.63 a share, on $ 1.30 billion in revenue. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> is a diversified communications company that publishes newspapers and magazines, operates television stations and syndicates news and feature stories worldwide. It also owns substantial interests in paper mills and has a stake in the Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Chevy Urges Dealers to Order More Cars</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> bulletin sent to Chevrolet dealers apparently turned into more orders for cars to be built in January, a company spokesman says. The bulletin said dealer orders through Nov. 22 were far below scheduled production and warned of plant shutdowns if the pace did n't pick up. `` The bottom line is whatever signals we sent to the dealers in late November clearly had an effect,'' said Chevrolet spokesman <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>. As of Tuesday, the 4,800 Chevrolet dealers had ordered about 75,000 cars from the January production of nearly 91,000, <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said. That was up substantially from the 24,130 cars that dealers had requested as of Nov. 22, he said. `` It is critical that all dealers immediately analyze their product needs and submit orders immediately,'' said the bulletin, quoted in a story in Monday's Automotive News trade journal. `` Adequate order banks are necessary to maintain uninterrupted production.'' `` There's no kidding about it,'' <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said. `` We're scratching for every order we can get and our dealers are scratching for every sale that they can get.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, owner of Sir <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevrolet-Geo </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said his business never received the bulletin. He said he has been trimming orders for 1990 vehicles because of costs of keeping them on hand. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> officials have contacted his dealership nearly daily `` giving us the opportunity to order some more vehicles,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. He has resisted large-scale orders, opting instead to keep his inventory in the 45 - to 50-day range `` I think in their -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- selling, they could n't hesitate to mention the fact that there may be some plant closures in January and February, even in some of the hotter lines,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` As we see it right now, that's their problem. Our immediate problem is selling vehicles.'' Chevrolet and Geo sales for the first 11 months of this year were 1,262,158 cars, down 7.3 percent from the same period last year. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> announced that some of its car - and truck-making plants in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would close briefly in January because of slumping dealer orders Even before the 1990 model year got off to its official start on Oct. 1, dealers were saying they planned to cut orders from manufacturers by up to 30 percent. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonkin </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, has urged the 20,000 members of his organization to cut orders even more to avoid costs of holding large inventories of cars on their lots.

<HEAD>UAL Board Meets Against Backdrop Of Buyout Turmoil</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Takeover turmoil continued to cloud the future of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> as directors of parent <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> gathered for today's regularly scheduled board meeting at the company's Chicago-area headquarters A new employee buyout plan that <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s management drafted was received cooly by leaders of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots and flight attendants, and ripped by the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union. Their response apparently has left Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> without a firm proposal for raising <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price and staving off disgruntled investors. Opposition from the Machinists helped scuttle a $ 6.75 billion pilot-management bid for the nation's second-largest airline in October and their support is considered important to the success of a revised offer. The Machinists represent about 25,000 of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s 70,000 workers. The plan floated by <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> management in meetings with employee groups would value <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> at $ 240 a share, or $ 5.43 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday, quoting unidentified sources. The plan envisions <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> employees owning about two-thirds of the stock and public stockholders about one-third, the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> management would invest $ 30 million for a 2 percent stake in the company and be granted options for another 6 percent, the report said. `` If that's the deal, it's unacceptable. We will oppose it,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, an adviser to the Machinists, in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Roseland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, office. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> representatives had not met with the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> regarding a revised buyout plan. He said the Machinists objected to the price and other terms of the deal outlined in the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> but he would not elaborate. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s stock climbed $ 2.75 to $ 176.75 in early <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. The Machinists' biggest complaint about the earlier, $ 300-a-share <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> buyout plan was that it would require an unacceptable level of borrowing. The deal, which had been approved by <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board, failed when lenders backed away, citing the Machinists' opposition. The failed bid would have given <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> workers 75 percent of the company with management owning 10 percent and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, 15 percent. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Conley </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Machinists in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the union also objected to any transaction involving <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s two top officers, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> and Executive Vice President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>. Representatives from <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> and from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> chapters of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> declined comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> report. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the pilots were given the proposal more than a week ago. United pilots have not publicly stated their opinion of the plan but their leader, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinsky </PERSON>, said last week his union would not be rushed into a transaction. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Friend </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants' union, said they were given the proposal last week and are still studying it <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board is under pressure from the investor group <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 11.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, to sell or otherwise restructure the company to boost share prices. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Gollust </PERSON>, a general partner in <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>, declined comment Tuesday on whether the New York-based partnership would support the reported buyout plan. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> has threatened to launch a drive for shareholder consent to dump 13 of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s 15 directors and create a five-member board.

<TEXT>
 Approval of a corporate restructuring plan by <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> shareholders has cleared the way for the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION>'s 825 hotels and formation of a new company to operate its <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> casinos. The restructurng plan was approved Tuesday at a special shareholders' meeting in <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>. Under the plan, <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> would sell its international hotel business to <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> for $ 540 million. A new company, <ORGANIZATION> Aztar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, would be formed at the same time to operate Ramada's three casinos. The transaction was approved by the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> gaming commissions Tuesday. `` Assuming that everything goes as scheduled, we will close the entire transaction next week,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Snell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, after the meeting More than 96 percent of the 30 million shares that were voted approved the plan, under which each shareholder would receive $ 1 in cash and one share of <ORGANIZATION> Aztar </ORGANIZATION> stock for each share of Ramada stock. <PERSON> Ramada </PERSON>'s original restructuring plan, which the company scrapped in October, included an offering of $ 400 million in debt securities, including $ 230 million in subordinated debt, or `` junk bonds,'' to finance the new company. Under that plan, shareholders would have received approximately $ 7 plus one share of <ORGANIZATION> Aztar </ORGANIZATION> stock for each share of Ramada stock. The company announced in October that it would not go forward with that plan because of `` unfavorable conditions'' in the junk-bond market, which has been depressed and unstable for months. The new plan includes a $ 170 million offering of debt securities and eliminates the junk-bond offering. Under the plan, each shareholder would receive $ 1 in cash plus one share of <ORGANIZATION> Aztar </ORGANIZATION> stock for each share of Ramada stock. Ramada spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said that under the new plan, <PERSON> Ramada </PERSON> would assume $ 230 million less in new debt, but would pay out $ 240 million less to its stockholders. `` It will be a less leveraged, stronger company,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. Fewer than 200 employees will lose their jobs once the transaction is completed, <PERSON> Snell </PERSON> said. `` The main reduction is in the hotel group,'' he said.

 Purchasing managers of the nation's corporations think the economy will avoid a recession next year but optimism has ebbed to the lowest level since the early 1980s.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, striving to meet deficit-reduction targets without a tax increase, is preparing to base its upcoming budget on an optimistic forecast showing 1990 economic growth far higher than many private estimates, administration sources said. The sources said Tuesday that the administration is expected to forecast that the economy, as measured by the gross national product, will expand by 2.6 percent next year. The administration's GNP figure is based on anticipated growth from the fourth quarter of this year to the fourth quarter of 1990.

<TEXT>
 The dollar fell today against all major foreign currencies in nervous European trading, dealers said. Gold prices were mixed. Dealers said they were flabbergasted by the dollar's tumble, which went beyond all expectations and has left most year-end trading strategies in shambles. `` There is a big uncertainty, people did n't expect that,'' said a dealer at a <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> bank. `` The question is now whether there is any interest by the central bank to support the dollar.'' Dealers said they had not seen any central bank intervention early today. The market was waiting for today's release of November <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail sales figures, traders said. Even if the sales figures were better than their modest expectations, dealers said bearish sentiment on the dollar was likely to persist at least until the end of the year. `` The only thing that could really help the dollar is a major crisis in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, like chaos in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or if -LRB- Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is toppled,'' said a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> trader. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 0.77 yen to a closing 143.70 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at a higher rate of 143.80 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's prices, included: 1.7233 West German marks, down from 1.7335; 1.5650 Swiss francs, down from 1.5765; 5.8900 French francs, down from 5.9275; 1.9410 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9715; 1,280.00 Italian lire, down from 1,285.75; and 1.1605 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1625 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $ 1.6085 to buy one pound, compared with $ 1.6027 late Tuesday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 417.25 a troy ounce, down from $ 417.50 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 417.10. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 416.80, up from $ 416.75 bid late Tuesday. Gold in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> fell $ 1.08 to close at a bid $ 414.73. Silver fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a bid price of $ 5.68 a troy ounce, down from Tuesday's $ 5.70.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index closed above 38,000 points for the first time today, while the dollar declined against the Japanese yen for the second consecutive day. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shot up 258.89 points, or 0.68 percent, ending the day at 38,062.42, a new high. It took only 16 trading days for the index to gain more than 2,000 points. It first climbed above 36,000 points on Nov. 21. The Nikkei index's gain today was prompted by rises in the futures market, said <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON>, a senior dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> also rose on index-buying, or purchases of at least 1,000 shares in all of the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION>'s 225 items, transactions that cost billions of dollars. `` Favorable economic factors, such as the yen's recent recovery against the dollar and gains on overseas stock markets, reassured participants and almost erased their worries,'' <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON> added. But some market players, especially institutional investors, remained cautious, resulting in just moderate trading. First section volume was estimated at 800 million shares, unchanged from the previous day. Among gainers were high-tech, trading house and construction issues. The dollar closed at 143.70 yen, down 0.77 yen from Tuesday's 144.47-yen close It opened at 143.80 yen and ranged between 143.35 and 143.90 yen. The dollar, which had gained 1.75 yen in a seven-day rise, now has lost 0.95 yen in the last two days. `` It was only the West German mark that moved actively,'' said <PERSON> Yutaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> trader. `` Although some market players in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> sold the mark for profit-taking, the mark weakened only temporarily and continued to soar, especially against the dollar,'' he said. The dollar's weakness against the mark resulted in the yen rising against the dollar, although dollar-yen trading was thin, <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON> said. Spot trading amounted to $ 8.42 billion, up from Tuesday's $ 3.87 billion.

<HEAD>Chrysler Not Building Subcompacts Until Mid-1990s</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will rely on a stripped-down version of a compact car to fill a void left when the company stops making subcompacts, a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> executive said. The nation's No. 3 automaker will stop building its <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Omni </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> subcompacts when it shuts down its Jefferson Avenue assembly plant in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> early in February. `` You'll see that low-end replaced by a value-oriented P-car,'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> marketing Vice President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Damoose </PERSON> said Tuesday. The P-car is the Dodge Shadow and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sundance </ORGANIZATION> built at the company's <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heights </ORGANIZATION> assembly plant. <PERSON> Damoose </PERSON> said the subcompact replacement probably would n't go into production until after cars derived from the LH and LX platforms are introduced, scheduled for the fall of 1992. According to <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s Automotive Reports, a weekly industry newsletter, subcompact cars made up 13.1 percent of the total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car market. The Omni and <PERSON> Horizon </PERSON>, the only subcompacts built by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, comprised 8 percent of the automaker's car sales of about 959,128 through Nov. 30. <PERSON> Damoose </PERSON> spoke to reporters as he outlined <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s plans for the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Show </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> next month. At that event, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will show off its new <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stealth </ORGANIZATION> sports car, which goes on sale in October; the new <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monaco </ORGANIZATION>, being built in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>; a LeBaron sedan, and a new Jeep. <PERSON> Damoose </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> planned to build 25,000 to 30,000 Stealth cars to compete in the same market as the <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> RX-7 and the <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> 300ZX. No price for the car has been set. Also, the company will have on hand six concept vehicles, which are used to show off design and engineering developments but are n't necessarily headed for assembly lines On other matters, <PERSON> Damoose </PERSON> said: _ <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is studying the effect of <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> advertising featuring entertainer <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, which was introduced earlier this year He said the research should be completed next month. He said he did n't know if the advertising had helped sell <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> cars. `` Nobody has ever talked about <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> advertising in their lives. Now they are,'' he said. So far this model year, <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> dealers have sold 75,426 cars and minivans, down 4.7 percent from the same time last year. _ <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> production planners are forecasting that the company will hold its 13.8 percent share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car and light truck market in 1990 That will come as sales for the entire industry tumble to about 14.2 million vehicles. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s 1990 sales estimate is the lowest of the Big Three. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> officials predict that about 15 million vehicles will be sold next year and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> executives put the volume at about 14.7 million, slightly lower than sales this year. `` Our strategy is to hold share and do it profitably,'' <PERSON> Damoose </PERSON> said. `` Whether it's going to take any more incentives is anybody's guess.

<HEAD>Biotech Patent Suit Ruling Murky But Analysts Say Ultimately Positive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 No clear winner was declared in the battle between two companies over rights to an anemia treatment drug, but a federal magistrate's murky ruling offered a potential boost to the biotech industry, analysts said. Consumers could ultimately come out the winners under the federal ruling because the two companies could reach a cross-licensing agreement that would ensure a stable and perhaps cheaper supply of the drug, analysts said Tuesday. The case began two years ago when <ORGANIZATION> Amgen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> sued <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for allegedly infringing on the biotech company's patent covering the production of erythropoietin, or EPO <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> countersued, claiming it held the rights to the protein itself, which stimulates the production of red blood cells and is often used to treat kidney disease. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saris </PERSON> issued a 184-page ruling Monday in which she found both patents to be mostly valid, meaning that each company had infringed on the other's patent rights. `` The greatest likely impact is greatly enhanced chances for negotiations leading to a settlement, which would involve cross-licensing for both parties,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>, a biotech stock analyst with <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>. Brown & amp; Sons in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Both parties may file an appeal in the case, but analysts said the protracted battle would likely end in a compromise that would allow <ORGANIZATION> Amgen </ORGANIZATION>, which has already secured <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> approval, to continue marketing EPO in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. For GI, cross-licensing would mean the company could use the Amgen-patented process to manufacture EPO domestically, where the estimated potential market for the drug is at least $ 200 million. <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> said Monday's ruling left a `` plethora of potential legal outcomes, but there is increased incentive for <ORGANIZATION> Amgen </ORGANIZATION> to negotiate on an even-handed basis with GI because there's an increased chance that <ORGANIZATION> Amgen </ORGANIZATION> could lose its right to market EPO in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Lawyers for both companies said they had not yet decided what their next step would be, but none ruled out the possibility of a compromise. `` In my mind it's somewhat of a common-sense type of thing,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON>, whose firm represents GI's Japanese partner, <ORGANIZATION> Chugai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` But that's assuming you can get two fighting parties together after a long battle.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Brand </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Amgen </ORGANIZATION>, said only that the company was examining `` all the options'' and would not rush a decision on whether to appeal the ruling. <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> was awarded a patent for the substance EPO in June 1987, but the scientist who purified the EPO described in the patent application used conventional chemistry to create it <ORGANIZATION> Amgen </ORGANIZATION> got a patent the following October for identifying the EP gene and for creating genetically engineered cells that contain and produce it. In effect, the only commercially viable way to produce <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s patented EPO is by using <ORGANIZATION> Amgen </ORGANIZATION>'s patented process. `` What we have here is two patents and two infringers,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` It's sort of a ping-pong match going back and forth and back and forth.'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatton </PERSON>, editor of Biotech Stock Letter in <LOCATION> Waltham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. said cross-licensing could benefit consumers by bringing both companies into the market, thus stabilizing sources of the supply, and also potentially undercutting prices. `` Because <ORGANIZATION> Chugai </ORGANIZATION> is behind in the actual marketing of the drug, they may come in at sort of a price discount, so you get some competition,'' he said. <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> said the ruling was also significant in that it upheld patents in the relatively untried biotechnology field. `` It's one of the first federal court rulings regarding genetically-engineered proteins used as therapeutic drugs,'' he said. `` There's been a lot of uncertainty where ownership as indicated by patents would end up in this field.'' <PERSON> Hatton </PERSON> agreed. `` It's a tremendously important suit ... for the biotech industry because before any venture capitalist puts money into the industry he has to believe these products are going to get patents,'' he said. `` It reduces a huge uncertainty and the effect is an increased stability.''

<HEAD>Du Pont, Waste Management to Build Plastic Recycling Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A $ 5 million plant to recycle plastics now mostly buried in landfills will open here in the spring in a joint venture between <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Known as the <ORGANIZATION> Plastic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recycling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, the 50-50 venture would demonstrate, first, the companies' commitment to recycling and, second, that household plastics collected at curbside can have a new life, officials of the two firms said Tuesday. They said they plan to build the concept into an environmentally safe, nationwide trash disposal network. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president, and <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hulligan </PERSON> said the 70-employee plant is the first that completes the recycling loop _ from picking up trash to turning it into new products like baseball gloves, park benches and home siding. `` Our plant is a very clean process,'' <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> said. `` It does n't affect the environment at all. Other firms operate similar plastic recovery plants, notably in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, but none is involved in trash collection. If the plant succeeds as expected _ handling up to 40 million pounds of residential-generated plastic annually the first few years _ another facility will open later next year in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> at a site to be selected. `` Future recycling facilities will be located in areas where the joint venture can purchase materials from curbside and deposit return programs throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> said, noting that <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> is the largest collector of trash in the world while <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> is one of the largest plastic makers. The two executives said the joint venture will have a total capacity of 200 million pounds from various trash sources by 1994. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> is headquartered in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> has its base in <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> envisioned a minimum of three plants If enough new product is produced in what he called an infant industry the venture might sell to other companies besides <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>, which has been recycling industrial plastics for about a decade. `` After the plastic materials are delivered, the venture sorts, cleans and reduces them to plastic flake, a usable raw material for processing by <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s requirement for raw materials for use in attractive new products assures the joint venture of a market and it assures <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> of a steady and reliable source of feedstock,'' <PERSON> Hulligan </PERSON> said. Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>, praising the site selection, said <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> today spends almost $ 65 million for solid waste disposal. A sound trash recycling program for which there is a market can save the city money, he said.

 The deficit in the broadest measure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade shrank to $ 22.69 billion in the July-September quarter, giving the country its lowest trade imbalance since early 1984, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the current account deficit dropped a dramatic 29 percent from a second-quarter deficit of $ 32.08 billion as the category covering income on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments abroard surged upward. The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is the most important trade statistic because it measures not only trade in merchandise but trade in services. The latter category includes the income Americans earn on their overseas investments and the income foreigners earn on their investments in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. For the third quarter, the services category registered a surplus of $ 8.72 billion, reflecting a decline in the value of the dollar during the period. A weaker dollar means that the profits <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies earn in foreign currencies are worth more when they are translated back into dollars. A rising dollar during the April-June quarter was blamed for depressing investment earnings in the second quarter, when the country registered a $ 1.66 billion deficit in the services category. That was the first services deficit in 30 years. Private economists, however, cautioned that the big swing of the services category back into surplus was likely to be only temporary. Many analysts forecast that the services category will be in deficit throughout the 1990s, reflecting the fact that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is now the world's largest debtor nation. Simply put, that means that foreigners now own more in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets than Americans own overseas. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s net debtor position stood at $ 532.5 billion at the end of last year and is expected to worsen by an additional $ 100 billion this year. Many economists are predicting that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> living standards will begin to decline because financing the growing foreign debt burden will mean that less money will be available for productive investment in this country. Through the first nine months of this year, the current account deficit was running at an annual rate of $ 113.55 billion, down modestly from the $ 126.55 billion deficit recorded in 1988. The $ 22.69 billion deficit in the third quarter was the lowest since a $ 20.9 billion imbalance in the first quarter of 1984. It occurred even though the merchandise deficit rose a slight 0.7 percent during the quarter to $ 27.75 billion, up from $ 27.55 billion in the second quarter. In addition to merchandise and services, the third segment of the current account deficit, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid payments and pensions to Americans living overseas, rose in the third quarter to $ 3.66 billion, up from $ 2.87 billion in the second quarter. The current account reflects the sum of the deficits or surpluses in the merchandise, services and foreign aid and pensions categories. At the start of this decade, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was running surpluses in its current account because earnings from American investments abroad were enough to offset perennial deficits in merchandise trade. But as Americans transferred billions of dollars into foreign hands to pay for imported cars and televisions, the investment cushion shrank rapidly and disappeared altogether in 1985, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years.

 A recent meeting between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its striking <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union has prompted a federal bankruptcy judge to postpone until Jan. 26 consideration of contempt charges against union leaders. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> on Tuesday granted the union's request that the hearing be deferred. The potential contempt charges stem from a disturbance Nov. 26 between pickets and working employees at <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelhard </PERSON>, an attorney representing the Machinists, said the hearing should be put off because of recent negotiations between union leaders and management. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 100, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> last week that he met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Nov. 30 with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> vice presidents <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. The three-hour meeting was led by federal mediator <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickford </PERSON>. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said it was the first such meeting since an informal session Oct. 13, and he and <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said both sides agreed to more meetings. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said all parties agreed not to describe or give details of the sessions. In a separate development Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and a committee representing major creditors agreed to postpone until sometime next week a meeting that had been planned for Wednesday, <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. Eastern reportedly is close to selling its Latin American routes to <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, for $ 300 million to $ 400 million. There has been speculation that a deal would be announced at the meeting with creditors. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has been operating as a smaller airline with replacement workers since March 4, when the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> struck and pilots and flight attendants walked out in sympathy. Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 9; the carrier is expected to submit a revised plan of reorganization at next week's session with creditors The Machinists continue to walk picket lines, but the pilots and flight attendants called off their sympathy strikes shortly before Thanksgiving. Seven striking Machinists were arrested Nov. 26 on charges of unlawful assembly when they refused to leave the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> airport after a group of pickets pelted cars with rocks and injured a working Eastern employee. At that time, <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> issued a show-cause order citing `` willful defiance'' of a July 17 temporary restraining order prohibiting the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> pickets from threatening or injuring Eastern workers. The Machinists cited in the order could face fines and court costs if found in contempt. They include <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pecca </PERSON>, Machinist officials based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> each plan to buy a 20 percent stake in a newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> for a combined total of $ 110 million, the British airline announced Wednesday. The other 60 percent of the new airline will be held by parent company <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, which is controlled by the Belgian government, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said. The new airline, formed after nearly six months of negotiations, is scheduled to start operations at the beginning of next year, extending <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION>'s present route network with a `` hub and spoke'' system centered on <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Zaventem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>' stake cost 34 million pounds, the equivalent of $ 55 million, while <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> confirmed that its stake cost 107 million Dutch guilders, also equal to about $ 55 million. The British carrier said the new <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION> airline is expected to exploit opportunities emerging from the progressive liberalization of European air transportation. This will include intercontinental routes such as linking <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for some services to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and linking <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> for some services to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, it said. In terms of revenue passenger kilometers, the new company is expected to treble <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION>'s current size in six years, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION> reported 1.2 billion revenue passenger kilometers, ranking it 16th among European airlines, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. British Airways ranked first, and <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> ninth by that measure, which is the number of kilometers airlines fly fare-paying passengers. The board of <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> will have 10 members with six coming from <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION> and two from each <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman will be <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafelghem </PERSON>, who is currently chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> European airlines have been scrambling to buy into other airlines and form joint ventures to become better competitors in the face of increasing deregulation and globalization of the travel industry. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> attempted to buy a 15 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> earlier this year, but abandoned the effort after the management bidding group encountered difficulties lining up the financing. This forging of ties has raised concern in some quarters that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s airlines eventually will be concentrated into two or three blocks, which could hurt competition, and ultimately the consumer. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, who requested anonymity, said the governing body of the 12-member Common Market would examine the new venture agreement to see whether it is anti-competitive. The commission ordered <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> to change terms of its acquisition of its smaller rival <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caledonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> two years ago. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said about the latest deal: `` The three airline partners will remain autonomous and continue to compete commercially.'' It said it already competes directly with <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION> on two routes, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, and that the competition will intensify.

<HEAD>Agencies Cite Reports of Rudder Control Problems on 737s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than a dozen reports of problems with rudder trim controls on <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s have been made since a plane skidded off a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> runway in September, two federal agencies investigating the accident said. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday they have asked <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to provide data on any reports it has received on rudders set in unexpected positions on its 737-300 and 737-400 model jets. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Schleh </PERSON> said the jet manufacturer is compiling the data. <PERSON> Schleh </PERSON> said it is not clear whether the federal request is connected with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> incident. `` This is just part of the information the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> accumulates in the normal course of an investigation like this,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said the agency has received at least a dozen reports, including two involving foreign airlines, of instances `` where the crew says it discovered the rudder was trimmed in a way that they did n't expect. The board began receiving the reports after its investigators found that the rudder was improperly set on <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> Flight 5050 as it tried to take off from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Sept. 20. Two passengers were killed and 45 injured when the 737-400 veered during takeoff and skidded into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, breaking into three pieces. The board will decide later this week whether it will hold public hearings on the accident, <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> said his agency has launched its own investigation after receiving several reports of rudder trim problems. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> expects to receive further information from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> next week and then will decide whether to order any action, such as a design change or modification, <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said. The inquiries are limited to the 737-300 and 737-400 models because they have electrically driven trim activators. Earlier 737-100 and 737-200 models have manual cranks. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has looked into the incidents to try to determine if the cause was related to human factors or a mechanical problem or a combination of both,'' <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said. The investigations will include whether a crew member inadvertently activated the rudder trim switch and an examination of the cockpit gauge that indicates how the rudder is trimmed.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly mixed in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, with wheat and soybeans mostly lower and corn mostly higher. The slight drop in soybean values largely reflected weakening in the soybean meal and oil markets and expectations for continued slow export demand, analysts said. Contracts for soybean deliveries next fall gained slightly, though, on reports of severe dryness in southern <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the world's second-largest soybean producer. Wheat was down slightly amid perceptions of slackening demand and ideas the market was due for a downward correction after its recent gains. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deparment </ORGANIZATION>'s rejection of several bids for export wheat also weighed on futures. Corn futures were mostly higher in line with the cash market, following Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announcement that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had bought about 100,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> corn. Sharply lower precious metal prices contributed to the markets' overall bearish cast, said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.12 a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent lower to 1 \ cents higher with December at $ 2.34 \ a bushel; oats were unchanged to -LCB- cent higher with March at $ 1.56 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were \ cent lower to 2 -LCB- cents higher with January at $ 5.76 -RCB- a Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle futures were .05 cent to .17 cent lower with the contract for delivery in December at 76.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .15 cent higher with January at 83.37 cents a pound; live hogs were .45 cent lower to .03 cent higher with December at 50.95 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .43 cent to 1.15 cents higher with February at 51 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled narrowly mixed on Tuesday.

 The season is in full swing when charitable organizations form a sort of joint venture with <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> and Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, filling mail boxes, telephone lines and shopping malls with requests for contributions. The fund raisers expect results from those extra efforts because they carry a double-edged appeal _ the emotional spirit of the holidays, and the pragmatic allure of a last-minute tax deduction. Some people object to this merger of generous and selfish motives. But from a practical standpoint, financial advisers say, a knowledge of the tax rules can make a big difference in how effectively you devote your limited resources to religious or community service groups, private education, or any other cause you consider worthy. First of all, the experts point out, you ca n't take any writeoff these days for charitable contributions unless you itemize deductions. That's important to consider, because the standard deduction has been sharply increased in the last few years. For 1989, it is $ 3,100 for a single taxpayer and $ 5,200 for a married couple filing a joint return. Contributions wo n't provide you with any extra tax saving if they and your other deductions, such as mortgage interest, do n't add up to more than those amounts Tax specialists advise people on the borderline to consider bunching deductible expenses such as contributions into alternate years and itemizing only in those years. There are strict rules as well covering just what contributions are deductible. Money given to a recognized church or charity, for instance, is almost surely eligible for a writeoff; country club dues almost surely not. `` An organization can -LRB- and undoubtedly will -RRB- tell you whether your contribution to it is tax deductible,'' says the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse in its annual Personal Tax Advisor. Gifts to individuals, or designated for an individual's use, are excluded by the rules. Also excluded are contributions to business or civic leagues and political parties or candidates. On the other hand, an eligible cash contribution is deductible in the year in which it is made, even if you use borrowed money. That means that you can give by credit card in December, pay the credit-card bill later and still take a deduction for 1989. Many organizations also readily accept non-cash gifts, such as old and outgrown clothing or furniture. `` Specific records must be kept to support a deduction for donated property,'' observe accountants <ORGANIZATION> Deloitte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Touche. Once the amount you claim in this category surpasses $ 500 in any year, the documentation requirements grow increasingly stringent. Some special incentives exist to donate stocks or other securities that you have owned for more than a year and have appreciated in value since you bought them. Under most circumstances, you can take a deduction for the present value of such a contribution _ and avoid paying taxes on the capital gain that occurred while you owned the asset in question. Much different advice applies in the case of securities that are worth less now than when you bought them, since giving them directly involves passing up a deductible tax loss. Such property `` should not be contributed to a charity,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Deloitte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Touche. `` It should be sold to realize the loss, and the proceeds of the sale should be contributed to charity.''

 The stock market pushed ahead today, getting more mileage out of the rally it began on Tuesday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 23.89 points Tuesday, rose 16.43 to 2,768.56 by noontime today on Wall Street. That brought the average to within striking distance of the record closing high of 2,791.41 it reached on Oct. 9, before it took a 190-point drop four days later. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 766 up, 536 down and 585 unchanged.

But interest rates rose a bit following the news, and investors still seemed to be cautious about the outlook for the economy in 1990 and the prospect that corporate profits might remain weak.

 Northeast Utilities made major gains today in its bid to buy <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>, the first big investor-owned utility to go bankrupt since the Depression. State <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, whose support was seen as key to <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION>'s success in a special legislative session scheduled for Thursday, now will support the $ 2.3 billion buyout. And <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> _ which had held out hope of winning the right to reorganize itself _ threw in the towel. House Speaker <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Scamman </PERSON> announced at a news conference that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders in both houses had united behind the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> plan after winning agreements intended to protect consumers and other <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> utilities. `` We're very confident they have protection and future -LRB- power -RRB- supply'' based on the agreements,'' <PERSON> Scamman </PERSON> said. The changes will be amendments to the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> takeover bill scheduled for a vote Thursday. Despite the developments, the vote still is too close to call, the No. 2 Republican in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> said. `` I wo n't make any prediction,'' Majority Leader <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Dupont </PERSON> said. He said he had n't decided how he would vote. Democrats, heavily outnumbered in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, continued to oppose the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> plan. `` We have come to no agreement,'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said this morning. Connecticut-based <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> proposes seven annual rate increases of 5.5 percent, the first taking effect Jan. 1. Northeast says the plan is `` Seabrook neutral,'' meaning it would not change regardless of whether <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant operates. The $ 6.3 billion plant, which plunged <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy reorganization in January 1988, is idle for lack of a federal operating license. The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> could issue a license as early as January, but appeals in federal courts are certain. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>'s largest electric utility, had been viewed recently as a distant second in the takeover competition. At a morning news conference, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffett </PERSON>, president and board chairman, attributed the utility's decision to drop out of the competition mainly to political opposition and <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s inability to win support from key creditor groups. Northeast, far and away the leading contender before today, had been seen as having little chance of winning legislative backing without support from <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>. As late as Tuesday night, <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> continued negotiating for further concessions from <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>. Legislative Democrats, and some Republicans, say the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> plan would be a windfall for investors without protecting consumers. Republican Gov. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> and other supporters of the agreement say the plan is far from ideal, but is the best that could be achieved under difficult circumstances _ and has the important benefit of avoiding years of legal wrangling and uncertaintly about rates. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, whose office had no comment this morning, charged Tuesday that the Democrats' real agenda in opposing Northeast is stopping <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>. Democrats are espousing `` the old agenda of let's kill <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> at any cost, even if the cost is that <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> consumers end up paying a lot more for energy and may not have the available supply they need in the future,'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said. Chambers denied it. `` The <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> issue is really a minor issue in all of this,'' she said Tuesday. `` This plan gives absolutely no protection to consumers and permits the company to make incredible profits.'' Republicans outnumber Democrats 3-1 in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and 2-1 in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said Tuesday she doubted that Republicans had sufficient votes to pass the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> plan. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> disagreed, predicting the plan would pass. Even if the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> passes the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> plan, it would need approval by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Yacos </PERSON> and various government agencies. Any changes to the plan presumably would require the approval of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> creditors, whose representatives had accepted the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> plan as it stood before today.

<HEAD>Blue Arrow Plans To Change Name To Manpower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest employment services company, said Wednesday it is taking steps to change its name to <ORGANIZATION> Manpower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, adopting the identity of the giant American agency it acquired in 1987. The company's board of directors on Tuesday voted unanimously to recommend the change to shareholders, it said. Blue Arrow Chairman <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Fromstein </PERSON>, former head of Manpower, obtained control of Blue Arrow management in a boardroom coup earlier this year. `` Since <ORGANIZATION> Manpower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> represents over 75 percent of the company's revenues and profits, and is the multinational brand among the company's holdings, it is appropriate to make this change,'' <PERSON> Fromstein </PERSON> said. `` It should surprise no one.'' The smaller Blue Arrow bought Manpower, based in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, in an acrimonious $ 1.34 billion takeover battle two years ago. In January, <PERSON> Fromstein </PERSON> emerged as <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arrow </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive after a fight among the company's directors and major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> franchisees over the management practices of <PERSON> Antony </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, then chairman and chief executive. <PERSON> Fromstein </PERSON> was named to replace <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> as chairman in April. Blue Arrow has suffered a series of financial embarrassments since the Manpower takeover, including the disclosure of a questionable loan to a Berry associate and the cover-up by its financial advisers of the failure of an 837 million-pound stock sale used to fund the takeover.

<HEAD>Lockerbie Legacy Makes Terrorism Fact of Life for Airlines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Airlines worldwide have tightened security since the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet terrorist explosion over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, spending large amounts of money on defenses that range from bomb-sniffing dogs to baggage X-ray gear. But two more big passenger planes have crashed in the year since then in presumed terrorist sabotage, and experts warn that another <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> could happen tomorrow. The Flight 103 bombing that killed 259 people in midair Dec. 21, 1988, has made terrorism a sobering and expensive fact of life for the airlines, especially the big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers that fly overseas. Sophisticated bombs timed to explode during flight have replaced hijacking as terrorists' favored mode of operation. The burly guards, body searches, bomb detectors and dogs trained to smell hidden explosives have become increasingly familiar staples of air travel, helping to drive ticket prices higher. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> sent a key directive to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines a month after the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> crash, requiring specific measures for inspecting baggage and screening passengers. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has ordered installation of sophisticated explosive-detection gear in 40 airports by next October. `` The aviation industry has taken steps to ensure better controls,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Risks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm. But, he said, `` terrorism is escalating worldwide; the terrorists are generally one step ahead of what airlines are able to do.'' In July 1988, the airlines intensified anti-terrorist defenses in response to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s downing of an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jetliner. But terrorists sneaked a sophisticated explosive through <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s security system six months later After the Pan Am bombing, the airlines again strengthened security. Then, last September, a <ORGANIZATION> UTA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 exploded over <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, in a suspected bombing that killed 174 people including seven Americans. In November an <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 crashed near <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, in what authorities called a suspected bombing by drug traffickers retaliating for a government crackdown. Airlines once declined to discuss security. But in the aftermath of the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> disaster, the airline industry has started making security a subtle part of its marketing campaign to attract and reassure passengers. For example, extensive publicity has been given to the so-called thermal neutron analysis explosive detectors that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has required. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> have been the first to install the new devices. The company that makes them, <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said they will be `` an important working model for other airlines to learn from as the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> security program goes forward.'' Still, most carriers still wo n't talk specifically about how much money they spend, although it is in the millions of dollars. They also criticize the government for not absorbing more of the cost. `` The airline industry is the surrogate target for the government,'' said <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> <PERSON> Boynton </PERSON>, director of security for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carrier. `` The government ought to give us more help and more assistance.'' But <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, called security `` a cost of doing business. Traditionally, the airlines have paid the cost of equipment needed for security reasons.'' Like jet fuel and passenger food, airline security is an expense that comes out of revenues or as a special surcharge added to ticket prices that passes the bill to travelers. Pan Am, for example, adds $ 5 to the cost of a one-way trans-Atlantic ticket. <PERSON> Boynton </PERSON> said American is the only major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline that uses its own employees for all security work. Most big carriers have their own security divisions but also contract with outside companies for passenger screening in airports and other protective services. American, which operates a growing number of flights to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, spends $ 11 million to $ 12 million a year on security, <PERSON> Boynton </PERSON> said. Its program is partly modeled on that of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which has a reputation for the toughest security measures. Spokesmen for American, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, queried by the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, all said their carriers strengthened what they called already-tight security after <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. Representatives of UTA and <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION> said those airlines stepped up security after disaster struck them. While financially strong airlines such as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> can afford top-quality security as well as newer, safer jets, there is concern that weaker carriers could be tempted to cut corners. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, for example, lost $ 158.3 million for the first nine months of this year, compared with a loss of $ 21 million in the same period in 1988. In every financial quarter since <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> has largely blamed its poor financial condition on falling trans-Atlantic passenger traffic resulting from the crash. In a recent ABC News special broadcast, some former security employees of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> alleged serious deficiencies in the airline's screening system. According to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> security supervisor in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where Flight 103 originated had a criminal record, unknown to the airline. The former employees charged that <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s security was compromised by cost-cutting and concern about on-time performance. Because it has been sued by a number of relatives of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> crash victims, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> can not respond specifically to the allegations about its <ORGANIZATION> Alert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriendler </PERSON>. He called the charges `` false and misleading'' and `` a vindictive effort to discredit a former employer.'' `` We strongly reject any suggestion that <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> or Alert would have deliberately compromised the safety of passengers and crew members to effect on-time departure or to cut costs,'' <PERSON> Kriendler </PERSON> said. Last August, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> created the Presidential Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism, scheduled to make recommendations to him next spring. The seven-member panel, headed by former labor secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, plans to evaluate aviation security, the handling of terrorist threats against air travel and whether the public should be told of them, and the government's treatment of terrorists' victims. At its first hearing, on Nov. 17, former <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> security director <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> told the panel that air security is `` seriously deficient'' in high-threat areas such as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Other experts agree. `` We are way behind in taking the necessary measures that will help to prevent this kind of tragedy happening again,'' terrorism expert <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> recently told a news conference in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` Another <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> could happen tomorrow.''

 Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly higher Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in light-volume buying linked largely to weather concerns. Bitter cold temperatures in the nation's midsection are stirring fears of damage to the winter wheat crop in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and spurring demand for soybean meal among cattle producrs. `` When the weather gets cold, they have to increase the energy component in the feed mix, so they feed the cattle more meal,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The soybean market was further supported by fears that the continuing dry weather in southern <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the world's second-largest soybean producer, would stretch into a drought The corn market rallied slightly on commercial buying, possibly indicating that new export sales are in the works, <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON> said. At the close, wheat futures were -LCB- cent to 2 cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.14 a bushel; corn futures were unchanged to 2 \ cents higher with December at $ 2.33 a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with December at $ 1.43 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 6 cents higher with January at $ 5.80 \ a

 Imagine a stack of 100,000 double-spaced, typewritten pages _ enough paper to make a stack 33 feet tall _ shrunk to one square inch. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> claimed Wednesday to have achieved that condensing job by storing, for the first time, a billion bits of information on a square inch of magnetic material. The record data density is 15 to 30 times greater than that of current magnetic hard disks, which are used for storing data, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said. It will be several years, though, before billion-bit, or `` gigabit'' disks, will be available commercially, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> invented the first commercial magnetic hard disk drives in the mid-1950s, and they have since become the most popular devices for storing computer data. In the gigabit demonstration at <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Almaden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, an aluminum disk was coated with a thin film of a magnetic cobalt alloy, which held the recorded bits. Experimental equipment recorded and read at a data rate of 3.5 million bytes per second. The measured error rates were sufficiently low _ one in a billion, decreasing to one in 10 trillion when error correction codes were used _ to meet the requirements of the computer industry. That latter accuracy level, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said, was the equivalent of transcribing more than 10,000 years of a newspaper before making a mistake.

<HEAD>Police Warning Follows Computer Sabotage Disks in Mail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Computer disks purporting to give information about AIDS have damaged computers at <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> banks, hospitals, universities and commercial institutions, police said Wednesday. The Fraud Squad at <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard police headquarters said an unspecified `` destructive mechanism'' had been found in the disks which had rendered computers unusable in 10 cases. The squad said it had reports of the floppy disks being received by mail in different parts of the country, from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. There were no confirmed reports of the disk being received outside <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The squad said it was investigating criminal damage caused by the disks to computers at banks, hospitals, universities and commercial institutions. The recipients were not identified. Two disks turned up Wednesday in the mail at the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and others were sent to the <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the City of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> police said. The City police, responsible for the financial district, warned companies to be on their guard. `` These disks must on no account be placed in computers. They are obviously meant to interfere with systems,'' City police headquarters said. City police said the disks apparently contained information about the disease AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. An accompanying letter asked for a `` license fee'' of either $ 189 or $ 378, depending on the type of license, to be sent to an address in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But the envelope was mailed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police said. The letter warned in small print that if the money was not paid the sender would use program mechanisms to stop a computer functioning normally, City police said. Computer companies said they believed addresses for receiving the disks had been obtained from PC Business World, a British weekly trade paper devoted to computing. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirst </PERSON>, an expert on computer sabotage, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the rogue disk was not of the virus type, which spoils computer systems by duplicating itself, but a `` Trojan'' which does direct damage. The name comes from the ancient Greek wooden horse concealing soldiers who came out at night to destroy the city of Troy. `` There are two programs on the disk,'' said <PERSON> Hirst </PERSON>, former technical editor of Virus Bulletin and a consultant on computer software. `` The first is an installation program and the second is a questionnaire on the risk of AIDS which will not run unless it is installed on a hard disk. It then prints off an invoice for a company in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> but the damage has already been done by the installation,'' he said. <PERSON> Hirst </PERSON> said he suspected the intention of the sender was entirely malicious. `` Money does not appear to be the motivation,'' he said. `` It may be difficult to understand but there are people out there who get a kick out of showing how clever they are. They may have a grudge against the world. They enjoy the idea of doing serious damage to people they do n't know, like those who put glass in baby food,'' he said. The alarm was first raised on Tuesday by Dr. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, chairman of a group of users of personal computers, who said he received a similar disk the previous day. `` If you have not installed it, then do n't. It seems to be some kind of sabotage,'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said. At the <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, an official, speaking anonymously, said: `` You must be off your head if you get an unsolicited disk and put it in your machine.'' The official said the disks would never have been put into the market trading system. If someone wanted to find out what was on them, he said, they would have used an internal system for transmitting office memos.

 The stock market settled for some scattered gains today after an early advance stalled. Analysts said traders drew some encouragement from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that retail sales rose 0.8 percent in November, exceeding most private estimates. That eased some worries on Wall Street that slackening consumer spending might be increasing the chances of a recession in the near future. But interest rates rose a bit following the news, and investors still seemed to be cautious about the outlook for the economy in 1990 and the prospect that corporate profits might remain weak. Brokers also noted that the market bogged down after the Dow Jones industrial average moved within striking distance of the record closing high of 2,791.41 it reached on Oct. 9, before it took a 190-point drop four days later.

<DATELINE>BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A tentative contract settlement was reached Wednesday between negotiators for Post Cereal and about 1,000 workers who struck 39 days earlier. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, president of Local 374 of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cereal </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bakery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, said union officials were recommending that members approve the proposal at a ratification vote scheduled for Thursday afternoon. `` I'm sure the membership will support us,'' he said. `` We're just pleased that this thing is coming to an end. Workers may be back at work as early as this weekend, with most returning on Monday, union officials said. Contract talks had snagged on the company's proposal to increase worker contributions to the medical insurance plan, something Powers said was addressed in the new contract. On Sunday, union members rejected the company's last proposal by more than a 2-1 margin. Negotiators met for about two hours Tuesday and again on Wednesday. `` We sincerely hope that employees will ratify this new offer so production can resume,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Beiser </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>. `` We believe that ratification and a return to work are in the best interest of all concerned parties.''

<HEAD>Tambrands Selling Two Units in Restructuring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Tambrands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday said it will sell its diagnostics and cosmetics businesses and cut its work force as part of a restructuring program that will allow the company to focus on its feminine hygiene products. Costs associated with the restructuring will cause <ORGANIZATION> Tambrands </ORGANIZATION> to take an after-tax charge of about $ 65 million against its fourth-quarter earnings. `` We have a profitable core business whose positive results have been burdened by the cost of unrelated and non-essential activities,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> F.C </PERSON>. <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive. He said the restructuring program `` will enable us to focus on our Tampax tampon business worldwide ...'' The company, which has its headquarters in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Success </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, estimates it will cut 100 to 200 employees from its current total of 700 salaried workers, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Konney </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tambrands </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president, said. The charge against earnings will cover the costs of trimming the payroll, consolidating some facilities, and revaluing <ORGANIZATION> Tambrands </ORGANIZATION>' investments in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, its diagnostics and cosmetics businesses and certain other assets <PERSON> Konney </PERSON> said he could n't comment on how the fourth-quarter charge will affect earnings. The company is due to report its fourth-quarter and full-year results in mid-February. He also said the company has n't estimated the proceeds from the planned sales of its First Response home diagnostics and Physicians Formula hypoallergenic cosmetics businesses. <ORGANIZATION> Tambrands </ORGANIZATION>' stock has periodically been bid higher on takeover speculation in recent months. <PERSON> Konney </PERSON> declined to comment on whether the restructuring program came in response to a takeover threat. Through three quarters of this year, <ORGANIZATION> Tambrands </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 61 million, or $ 2.72 a share, down from $ 71 million, or $ 3.17 a share, a year earlier. Nine-month revenue totaled $ 449 million this year, up from $ 428 million in 1988.

<HEAD>GAF and Vice Chairman Convicted of Stock Manipulation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal jury on Wednesday convicted <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a top executive of manipulating the price of a company's stock, as the government won another victory in its crackdown on Wall Street fraud. After two previous mistrials, the jury in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> found <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> and Vice Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> guilty on all eight counts of stock manipulation, securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. Two <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries were acquitted of all charges. <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>, 56, of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, faces up to 40 years in prison and $ 2 million in fines when sentenced March 9 by Judge <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, N.J.-based chemical and building materials manufacturer, could be fined a total of up to $ 4 million. <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, said he would appeal the conviction. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement: `` We will leave no stone unturned in pursuing every avenue of appeal. We continue to have complete confidence in <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>, who will continue in his postions as vice chairman and chief administrative officer.'' <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, two subsidiaries and <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> were indicted in July 1988 for allegedly trying to boost the stock price of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 shortly before selling a large block of Carbide shares. When the case was first presented to a jury a year ago, it attracted wide attention as the first criminal trial stemming from the insider trading scandals of the mid-1980s. Since then, several other cases have resulted in jury convictions, including the Princeton-Newport Partners racketeering and fraud case and the stock manipulation trial of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>. The first <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> trial ended in mistrial last January when <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> determined prosecutors unintentionally withheld a piece of evidence. A second mistrial was declared in March when the jury deadlocked after 12 days of deliberations. `` Justice is finally done,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewenson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. After the verdict, an ashen-faced <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> embraced his wife and daughters `` I'm terribly disappointed and I'm innocent of these charges,'' he said to reporters. The subsidiaries found innocent of the charges were <ORGANIZATION> Jay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The government's case against <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> was based largely on the testimony of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> broker <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, an admitted felon who has payed a key role in other securities fraud cases as part of a plea agreement with the government. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> asked him in October 1986 to boost <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>'s price to $ 22 a share and agreed to pay $ 40,000 to cover losses in the deal. A higher stock price would have meant more money for <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, which had accumulated 10 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> during a failed takeover bid in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> sold five million shares to <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 23 each on Nov. 10. After a six-week trial, the jury returned its verdict after about eight hours of deliberations, compared with some 93 hours in the second mistrial. The verdict also came despite the introduction of new evidence in the trial's last week that apparently contradicted key testimony by <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> and a trading asistant at his firm. Defense attorneys introduced telephone records indicating that no calls were placed on long-distance WATS lines from the <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> brokerage to <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> or Sherwin during times in October 1986 when the government alleged the manipulation was discussed. Defense lawyers had branded <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> as a crook who had schemed illegally with jailed stock speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who paid $ 100 million to settle insider trading charges in late 1986. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> fingered <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, who last year agreed to plead guilty to two securities law violations. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> earlier this year was sentenced to five years probation and a $ 250,000 fine.

 A visit to a <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> store, with its dark green front and blackberry sprig motif, woodsy interior and heathery scents, conjures up images of the cozy, privileged gentry of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. You expect to bump into young, upper class `` English roses'' with cultivated accents and gorgeous complexions, who attend society balls, drive <ORGANIZATION> Range </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rovers </ORGANIZATION> and adore their terriers. But behind the scenes, times are tough for <ORGANIZATION> Laura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ashley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the British retailer famous for popularizing the frilly clothes and home furnishings of the English countryside. Business is suffering because of a slowdown in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail sales, high interest rates in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and the weak dollar, which makes British goods more expensive for American buyers. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> as responded by entering the male market and updating its designs. Retailing industry analysts believe the company will survive the crisis and prosper. Profits have been disappointing for the past three years, repeatedly undershooting estimates and leaving the public holding shares worth nearly half the price they fetched when <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> went public four years ago. The company recently announced it would cut 100 jobs _ the first major layoffs ever _ in its struggle to restructure and boost profits. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> is a classic rags-to-riches tale, begun as a small cottage industry 36 years ago by Mrs. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> and husband <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> on the kitchen table of a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> attic flat. It became an international force, but analysts say it has failed to change with the times. Traditional shops are near the saturation point in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. However, the <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> look has proved to have enduring appeal. Welsh-born Mrs. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>'s legacy includes `` a vibrant design ethos in tune with nostalgia for the past as well as the New Age ideology of the Nineties,'' fashion writer <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> recently wrote in the Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. A great void was created in the company when Mrs. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, known as `` LA,'' died of head injuries in September 1985 at age 60 after a fall down steep stairs at her daughter's west <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> home. It happened just as the company was opening a flagship store in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and two months before <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> shares were sold on the stock market. Mrs. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>'s successors insisted the business would thrive because it was a design house, not a one-woman show. But the company says her original concepts remain the foundation. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, knighted in 1987, continues as chairman, but pursues other interests, such as the development of a chain of Ashley Inn hotels. The day-to-day management is left to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, a Welshman and longtime employee named chief executive two years ago. The <ORGANIZATION> Ashleys </ORGANIZATION>' son <PERSON> Nick </PERSON>, one of four children, serves as design director The <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> family, with the <ORGANIZATION> Ashley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, retains 70 percent of the company's stock. The situation is quite different from 1985, when investors rushed to benefit from <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>'s expansion plans. Crowds lined up to buy <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> shares in a $ 36 million sale that was 34 times oversubscribed. The shares sold for the equivalent of $ 2.12 each. Now they trade at the equivalent of $ 1.26 at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Earnings fell 38 percent to $ 6.6 million or 3 cents a share, on a 15 percent revenue gain to $ 211 million in the six months ended July 29. `` It is having problems. It's a very difficult phase,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Olier </PERSON>, retail analyst at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woodmac </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's a lot of potential there still, but it's very difficult to realize it. Analyst <PERSON> Kimlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> investment firm said: `` It has n't been that nobody likes <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> clothes anymore. It's just a question of translating that into profits, which <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> has quite frankly failed to do.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> blamed that failure on what she called undirected growth and inadequate financial controls. The company's manufacturing segment, which makes most of what <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> sells, has n't been responding to retailing demands The Ashleys started printing fabrics on the kitchen table in 1953. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> designed furnishing prints and printing machines, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> made place mats and scarves which she sold to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> department stores. The couple expanded into garments and eventually into accessories, wall paper and soft furnishings. The clothes are affordable, feminine, and rural. Made of natural fabrics, they have flowing lines, wildflower prints, frills and bows. The company sells lots of sweet dresses, high neck blouses, sailor outfits, and navy blue basics. `` I do n't like ephemeral things,'' <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> once said. `` I like things that last forever, like the straw hat you're fond of and wear all your life.'' The Ashleys moved to <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> in 1961 and six years later established company headquarters in a disused railway station in <LOCATION> Carno </LOCATION>. The first <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> shop opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s posh <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION> in 1968, and in 1974 the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> store opened in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> look, harking back to an imagined Victorian age of bucolic simplicity, also struck a chord in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where sales quickly rivaled sales at home. At the end of its last fiscal year, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> operated 172 stores in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and 164 in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. It had more than 400 shops worldwide, 8,000 employees and 17 factories. Despite the fast growth, maternal Mrs. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> considered employees `` an extension of our family.'' She gave them stock, ended the workweek early on Friday, and insisted the canteen serve healthy food. Its present, more corporate-minded management has sought to slim down operations, and has broken the company into divisions responsible for their onw profits. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> also has been acquiring some smaller clothing and accessory businesses, updating its clothing designs to give widen appeal, and opening free-standing home furnishings stores to attract more men. It also has developed a popular `` Mother and Child'' collection of coordinated clothes. `` How long that -LRB- strategy -RRB- will take to bear fruit to the bottom line is another question,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said.

 The stock market churned ahead in erratic yearend trading Wednesday, extending the advance it began the day before. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 16 points at midsession, closed with a 8.96 gain at 2,761.09. On Tuesday it climbed 23.89 points. Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 791 up, 734 down and 496 unchanged. Analysts said traders drew some encouragement from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that retail sales rose 0.8 percent in November, exceeding most private estimates. That eased a few worries on Wall Street that slackening consumer spending might be increasing the chances of a recession in the near future. But open-market interest rates rose following the news, and investors still seemed to be cautious about the outlook for the economy in 1990 and the prospect that corporate profits might continue to lag. Brokers also noted that the market bogged down after the Dow Jones industrial average moved within striking distance of the record closing high of 2,791.41 it reached on Oct. 9, before it took a 190-point drop four days later. Energy stocks were mixed in active trading, running into some resistance after their recent rally inspired by cold weather in many parts of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and forecasts of higher oil prices in the months ahead. Among the volume leaders, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> rose -LRB- to 26 ~; <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> dropped -LCB- to 50 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> lost -RCB- to 54 ~, and <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> was down ~ at In the blue-chip industrial sector, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> rose \ to 43; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> 1 -LCB- to 46 |; Coca-Cola -RCB- to 80 \, and <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> 1 to 124 But leading computer and technology issues were weak, apparently depressed by yearend tax selling. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> dropped 1 -LRB- to 95 ~ and <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> was down 2 -RRB- at 82 |, trading at its lowest levels in more than three <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> fell 8 to 168 -RCB- as hopes diminished for emergence of a new deal to replace the buyout plan by an employee-management group that was dropped this fall after it ran into financing problems. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 184.66 million shares, up from 176.82 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 220.86 million shares. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 6.55 billion, or 0.19 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks gained .57 to 195.01. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose .36 to 403.07, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.02 at 352.75 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added .71 to 451.14.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailers' sales rebounded in November, the government said Wednesday in a report analysts saw as showing stronger-than-expected Christmas buying and less chance of a recession. The 0.8 percent increase, the biggest in four months, `` clearly signals that the economy is resilient,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahn </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` Fears of a poor Christmas retail season should abate with this report.'' `` It's clearly stronger than was expected,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> government securities dealer. `` As long as spending holds up, there's no threat of a recession.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that sales rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 144.6 billion in November after plummeting 1.3 percent in October, when they were driven down by skidding automobile sales. The October sales were revised after originally being reported to have fallen 1 percent. Many economists were expecting only a weak improvement in November since unit car sales fell again in November. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the 0.5 percent increase in the automotive category probably reflected an increase in prices, not sales. Excluding the auto category, the report was even more positive, showing a 0.9 percent advance. Automakers reported Wednesday that sales of cars and trucks by the nation's eight major automakers continued to drop in early December, sinking 23.7 percent from last year's level. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> suggested a shift in Christmas-present buying patterns might have contributed to the November strength and might mean more moderate growth this month. `` We're getting more and more spending in the last week of November and less in the first weeks of December,'' he said. `` The way to measure the Christmas season now is to average the November and December spending patterns.'' And Ms. <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> added, `` It's taken a lot of price-slashing to get those sales. So even if dollar sales are decent this Christmas, it's unclear whether the profits will be so great.'' Retail sales account for about one-third of the nation's economic activity, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, senior financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> DRI </ORGANIZATION> @ <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said the stronger November report caused him to boost his estimate of overall growth <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said if strong sales continue in December, the gross national product could increase at a 1 percent rate in the final quarter of the year instead of the 0.5 percent he had been predicting. `` This relieves the worries that the fourth quarter could turn into a negative quarter,'' he said. Not all analysts were as upbeat, however. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, senior economist at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, pointed out that sales in both September and October had been revised downward. `` I do n't think we are going to have a recession, but it is still iffy,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. There had been concern that Christmas spending would be held back by a slowing economy. But even sales of durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last at least three years _ posted a 0.7 percent gain after falling 3 percent in October. These sales often are affected by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s interest-rate policies because many are financed by loans Sales of building materials were up 2 percent, reflecting in part repairs following Hurricane Hugo and the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay-area </LOCATION> earthquake. The category had fallen 1.1 percent in October. Furniture and other home furnishing sales gained 1.6 percent on top of a 0.8 percent increase the previous month. Sales of non-durable goods rose 0.9 percent, following a 0.3 percent decline in October. All non-durable goods categories except drug stores posted increases: general merchandise including department stores sales, up 0.7 percent; grocery stores, 0.8 percent; gasoline stations, 0.9 percent; apparel, 2.4 percent, and restaurants and bars, 0.9 percent. Drug store sales were down 0.1 percent. For the three months from August through October, overall retail sales were up 4.8 percent. Sales for the first 11 months of 1989 were up 5.7 percent over the same period of 1988.

<TEXT>
 Gold prices tumbled in worldwide trading Wednesday, while the dollar finished mixed against other major currencies in choppy, hectic dealings after rebounding overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $ 408.10 a troy ounce, down $ 9.80 from late Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> quoted a late bid for gold at $ 408 an ounce, down $ 9. The plunge in gold also helped depress other precious metals, such as silver. Dealers attributed gold's decline largely to profit-taking from its recent steady rise and to technical market factors. They noted particularly strong selling by <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> investors. In currency trading, <PERSON> Zlatko </PERSON> <PERSON> Glamuzina </PERSON>, chief currency dealer at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> di </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sicilia </ORGANIZATION>, likened Wednesday's trading to `` a tug of war between the bulls and the bears. `` The bulls would like to see the dollar go up and they say it has reached its bottom, but the bears are trying to pulling it lower and seem to be winning the battle overall,'' <PERSON> Glamuzina </PERSON> said. The dollar got a boost from rumors that Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had resigned, although they were swiftly denied by the Soviet Embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, currency dealers said. Also supporting the dollar were reports of intervention by some central banks to push down the value of the surging <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> mark, they said. Putting a damper on the dollar, however, was speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was easing interest rates. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.77 Japanese yen to close at 143.70 yen. It traded at 144.13 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and at 144.05 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from 144.00 yen late Tuesday. The dollar was stronger against the British pound. Sterling bought $ 1.5955 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, down from $ 1.6027 Tuesday; and $ 1.6000 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, down from $ 1.6085 late Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.7280 West German marks, down from 1.7322; 1.5645 Swiss francs, down from 1.5732; 5.9070 French francs, down from 5.9185; 1,289.00 Italian lire, up from 1,284.75; and 1.1597 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1625. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with Tuesday, included: 1.7390 West German marks, up from 1.7335; 1.5965 Swiss francs, up from 1.5765; 5.9475 French francs, up from 5.9275; 1.9430 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9715; 1,296.25 Italian lire, up from 1,285.75; and 1.1585 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1625. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 411.25 an ounce from $ 417.50 Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, gold slipped to $ 411.00 an ounce from $ 416.75. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 1.08 to close at a bid $ 414.73 an ounce. Silver prices also fell sharply. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $ 5.544, down from $ 5.672 late Tuesday. Silver fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to $ 5.59 an ounce from $ 5.70.

<DATELINE>McALLEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s reviving economy is on display at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION>, where the parking lot is full of license plates from across the border. In this city 10 miles north of the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, and all along the U.S.-Mexico frontier, one fact of international trade stands out: Mexican shoppers have returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to visit and shop, recovering from the brutal 1980s that brought `` la crisis.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> says Mexicans are spending as much and possibly more money on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side of the border than they did 10 years ago. As a result, <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>'s La Plaza Mall has the highest sales per square foot of any of the 70 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shopping centers owned by the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, Ind.-based <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, southern regional manager with the firm. La Plaza's average merchandise sales of $ 404 per square foot is more than double the firm's national average of $ 189 per square foot The company's No. 2 mall is <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Paso </PERSON>'s Cielo Vista, with sales of $ 338 per square foot, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. He attributes much of the border malls' success to the crowds of Mexican shoppers returning over the past two years. `` The Mexican nationals, what they're looking for is quality,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. `` They are not looking for sales.'' `` We have a lot of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> traffic that drives, a lot of traffic from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that fly and the regular bus traffic that come across,'' said <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> McAllen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. That is a vast improvement over just a few years ago. After huge oil revenues and massive public spending and borrowing led to a brief boom from 1979-81, a sudden drop in oil prices in 1981 fractured the Mexican economy. Mexicans watched the peso diminish from a value of 26 to the dollar at the beginning of 1982, to 149 to the dollar by the end of that year. Border retailers on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side soon found their stores empty. The Mexicans' money suddenly bought only one-sixth of what it used to buy, so they no longer could shop in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The disappearance of the Mexican shopper quickly drove many stores out of business all along the border. Mexican expenditures in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> by 1983 dropped to half of what they were in 1979. Business in 1983 was off 80 percent in downtown <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallek </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>'s Man Shop and the Palais de Parfum in downtown McAllen and another men's clothing store at La Plaza Mall He estimated that 85 percent of his downtown sales and 60 percent of mall sales are to Mexicans. Although the peso by 1987 dropped to 2,500 to the dollar as foreign debt plagued the nation, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s economy since has begun to calm down. The exchange rate fell only to about 2,650 by December 1989. Mexicans are spending abroad again because the peso has stabilized, and because of new confidence in President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s economic liberalization, said <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagnasco </PERSON>, an economist with the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> City-based <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are now having an economy with stable prices,'' she said. If Mexican spending on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side of the border for the second half of 1989 continues at the rate of the first half, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailers will surpass the $ 2.24 billion sales to Mexicans that <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> estimated for the boom year of 1979. During 1988, Mexican purchases of $ 2.09 billion in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> were $ 500 million higher than in 1987, the bank said. Steady growth in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 1,500 border assembly plants, or `` maquiladoras,'' also has boosted the buying power of a new industrial work force of about 350,000. `` When <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> comes across, it stirs up the whole economy,'' said retailer <PERSON> Fallek </PERSON> in <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>. `` They feel better about themselves, about their country and their government. Right now, they do n't seem so worried.'' Retail sales growth of 22.6 percent in 1988 in the <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION> area was the biggest increase of all the state's metropolitan areas, according to the State Comptroller's office. In the adjacent <LOCATION> Brownsville-Harlingen </LOCATION> area at the southern tip of the state, retail sales grew by 15.8 percent in 1988. In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, the retail growth rate was 9.5 percent. For comparison, sales grew state wide by only 6.4 percent in 1988. Retailers say this year will turn out even better. <PERSON> Fallek </PERSON> said the gradual return of the Mexican shoppers since last year will make 1989 his best year since 1981. <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> retailer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Begum </PERSON> said he also has seen a steady improvement in sales since the peso crash cut his sales in half. His downtown New Yorker store caters to customers like the woman from <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, who on a recent Friday stopped in looking for something to wear to a party and bought a $ 2,500 fur coat. At the other end of the border, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ysidro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, retailers see the same recovery, said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` There does n't seem to be a lot of -LRB- retail -RRB- space available for anything, particularly close to the border,'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said. Another positive economic sign in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is the cooling of its runaway inflation that hit 159 percent in 1987. Inflation dropped to 52 percent in 1988, and is projected to be 20 percent for 1989 and 15 percent in 1990. Inflation, however, still makes many products cheaper in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> than in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Inflation-fighting consumers can be found among the Mexicans driving or flying home with new dresses and toys, as well as those carrying bags of toilet paper and groceries across the international bridges.

Great Northern instead is pinning its hopes on courtroom decisions to fend off the unsolicited $ 63 a share tender offer, valued at a total of $ 3.8 billion `` While we're in the courts we're not considering anything else,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laidig </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of Great Northern. `` Naturally we're talking to our financial advisers about what the future would look like when we finish winning this court fight with <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, but there's actually no specific work going on right now and we certainly are not looking for a white knight,'' <PERSON> Laidig </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Laidig </PERSON> said other paper company executives have brought up the takeover attempt but he has made sure not to get into any talks about alternate mergers. When <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> made its initial offer of $ 58 per share on Oct. 31, there was speculation by some analysts that other paper companies might enter the bidding, but that has not happened. Great Northern stock finished down 50 cents at $ 61.75 a share on Wednesday. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> was unchanged at $ 50.87 -LCB- a share. `` I've talked to some other CEOs who have said they're sorry to see this situation the way it is, but nobody's gone any farther than that, because I would n't have let them even if they wanted to,'' <PERSON> Laidig </PERSON> said. Laidig would not name any of the executives he had talked to, but said <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> also has heard from foreign companies that are watching the situation. `` We sell a lot overseas and there have been people who questioned whether there was a long-term interest in staying independent or something like that,'' <PERSON> Laidig </PERSON> said. `` Now whether that characterized the fact that they might be interested in some other action or not, I do n't know. We certainly have had a lot of our customers overseas who have indicated they are interested in whether we do or do not stay independent. But none of them have come forward and said, ` We'd like to buy you, or buy this or buy that or anything like that.''' The legal battles are being fought in federal court in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> filed a lawsuit challenging Great Northern's `` poison pill'' takeover defense and a state anti-takeover law, and in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, where Great Northern has filed an antitrust suit against <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> also is examining the proposed merger for potential antitrust problems and is expected to state any objections by Dec. 21. `` We think that our offer for Great Northern will succeed, and we think our acquisition offer fully complies with antritrust laws,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Wednesday from <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Laidig </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> on Wednesday for a news conference at which he defended company lawyers for persuading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to unseal a <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> consultant's study that showed different cash-flow scenarios based on a theoretical merger followed by sales of Great Northern mills in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> said the study, unsealed this week, had been rejected long ago and accused Great Northern of a `` cheap shot.'' <PERSON> Laidig </PERSON> said his company felt that people in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> were entitled to the information and <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> should have disclosed it previously. But in response to a question, <PERSON> Laidig </PERSON> said he would not make promises about Great Northern's willingness to protect jobs and sensitive woodlands. The company, based in <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and incorporated in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, has been in business for almost a century in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and does n't believe it has to prove anything to Mainers, he said.

<HEAD>Gold Prices Plunge As Soviet Union Rejects Radical Reforms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Gold futures prices fell sharply Wednesday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> rejected reforms that many investors had hoped would lead to a gold-backed Soviet currency Futures prices of silver and platinum also plunged, frustrating speculators in the increasingly volatile precious-metals markets. On other commodity markets, heating oil for near-term delivery rose for the 11th straight day; livestock and meat futures advanced; and grains and soybeans were mostly higher. Gold futures fell $ 9.80 to $ 10.80 with the contract for delivery in December settling $ 9.80 lower at $ 408.10 a troy ounce; silver finished 12.8 cents to 13.8 cents lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> with December at $ 5.544 a troy ounce. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, platinum futures sank $ 13.70 to $ 14.10 with the January contract settling at $ 504.70 a troy ounce. From mid-October through late November, gold soared from near $ 360 an ounce to almost $ 420, partly on ideas that the economic changes sweeping Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would include a move by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to back its currency, the ruble, with gold. Such a move would greatly increase the ruble's value on the world market, where it is now almost useless, facilitating trade with other countries. A gold-backed ruble apparently was not discussed by the Soviet Parliament Wednesday, but they rejected other radical economic reforms, disappointing gold traders who had hoped for some strong indication of change, analysts said. `` There's been a lot of speculation but so far not anything done, and I think that's kind of frustrated people,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` People were looking for something out of the Politburo.'' Analyst <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the gold selloff also appeared linked to an unconfirmed but persistent rumor that Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had offered to resign. The rumor `` has shaken confidence in people who bought gold'' on speculation of Soviet reform, he said. January heating oil futures surged on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s report late Tuesday of an unexpectedly large reduction in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks of petroleum distillates last week. Extremely cold weather in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have kept demand for heating oil strong. Other energy futures were mixed. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent lower to 12 cents higher with January at $ 20.77 a barrel; heating oil was .60 cent lower to .66 cent higher with January up .66 cent at 67.96 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .10 cent to .20 cent lower with January at 51.93 cents a gallon. Livestock and meat futures ended mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with most of the strength centered in the pork-belly pit, where prices rose sharply in a technically-inspired rebound from recent steep losses. Live cattle futures settled .07 cent lower to .10 cent higher with December at 76.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .20 cent higher with January at 83.42 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent lower to .78 cent higher with December at 51.70 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1 cent lower to 1.53 cent higher with February up 1.53 cents at 51.90 cents a pound. Most grain and soybean futures rose on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in light-volume buying linked largely to weather concerns. Bitter cold temperatures in the nation's midsection are stirring fears of damage to the winter wheat crop in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and spurring demand among cattle producers for soybean meal, a high-energy feed additive. Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 1 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 4.14 -LCB- a bushel; corn futures were \ cent to 2 \ cents higher with December at $ 2.33 \ a bushel; oats were unchanged to -RCB- cent lower with December at $ 1.43 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 7 cents higher with January at $ 5.80 -LCB- a

 The conviction of <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its vice chairman strengthens a belief that the government's pursuit of white-collar wrongdoing is getting through to the public, lawyers said Wednesday. One day after hotel queen <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was sentenced to seven years in prison for tax evasion, a federal jury convicted chemicals manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and vice chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> of stock manipulation, securities fraud and other charges. The verdict _ which followed two mistrials in the same case earlier this year _ was another notch in the government's belt of securities fraud convictions. But some lawyers said it was surprising because of controversial and often contradictory testimony by admitted felon <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> and surprise evidence introduced at the trial's close undermining central portions of the government's case. `` The pattern you see from a variety of these cases is that if there is some smoke there _ circumstantial evidence _ then juries tend to find there is some fire,'' <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> securities law professor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. `` I do think the jury particularly in Wall Street cases has a good deal of skepticism of the motives of people,'' he said. `` This is a case where there was some evidence but it was a one-witness case.'' <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, N.J.-based <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> and two subsidiaries were convicted of eight counts of stock manipulation, securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. Two <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries were acquitted of all charges. They were found guilty of manipulating the price of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock in collaboration with <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> in October 1986, seeking to push up the share price before selling a large block <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> had amassed in a failed takeover. With the exception of one split verdict, juries this year have returned convictions in all major <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> fraud cases _ against six defendants in the <ORGANIZATION> Princeton-Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> trial, takeover specialist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> bond trading assistant <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and others. In addition, the government has obtained guilty pleas from figures such as former investment banker <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, arbitrager <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> and stock speculator <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. `` It's another part of the message that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office has been sending to the financially fortunate of our country, that manipulation of our financial mechanisms and failure to pay taxes are going to be severely dealt with,'' said attorney <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Walpin </PERSON>, a former prosecutor The <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> jury returned a verdict after about only eight hours of testimony. The second mistrial, in March, was declared after 12 days and 93 hours of deliberations. The first mistrial was declared because the government unintentionally withheld a piece of evidence. `` Maybe all the media concentration on fraud on Wall Street has pressured the public that all the fraud on Wall Street was more severe than it thought initially,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromberg </PERSON>, a securities law professor at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think we're developing a pretty healthy distrust of our financial institutions,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> introduced evidence in the last week of the trial that appeared to show that telephone calls allegedly made by <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> after <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> tried to manipulate the stock never actually occurred. `` It seemed to be a pretty significant piece of evidence but the jury did n't think so,'' said one defense lawyer in a major case who asked not to be named.

 Energy futures prices finished mixed Wednesday with demand strong for wholesale home heating oil for delivery next month. A collapse in a rally in <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> gasoil, the equivalent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> heating oil, took some of the edge off the buying enthusiasm here, analysts said. The contract for January delivery of No. 2 heating oil rose 0.66 cent to 67.96 cents a gallon on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, adding to Tuesday's gain of 0.35 cent But contracts for delivery during February through April fell by amounts ranging from 0.35 cent to 0.60 cent. The nearby heating oil contract gained support from continuing cold weather in parts of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and particularly strong demand for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> oil. Predictions of rising temperatures in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> discouraged buyers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Among other refined oil products traded on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Merc </LOCATION>, wholesale unleaded gasoline for January delivery, which dropped 0.37 cent on Tuesday, sank another 0.10 cent to 51.93 cents a gallon. Other contracts also closed lower. The weakening in gasoline futures is typical for this time of year when driving declines due to bad weather conditions. The January contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, rose 12 cents to $ 20.77 per 42-gallon barrel. The February through April contracts ended 1 cent lower to 4 cents higher. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>, said prices opened higher in reaction to a fairly bullish report from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The weekly statistics, released after the market closed on Tuesday, showed an unexpectedly large reduction in crude oil stocks. The initial strength faded in what <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> characterized as a technical price correction.

 <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday disclosed its financial losses grew significantly in the late summer and early autumn due to costs promotions aimed at boosting sales. The retailer said it lost $ 33.12 million, or $ 23.92 a share, in its first fiscal quarter of 1990, compared with a loss of $ 19 million, or $ 15 a share, in the same period a year earlier. Sales rose 5.2 percent to $ 1.71 billion in the three months ended Oct. 28 from $ 1.62 billion a year earlier. Macy, which went private in a leveraged buyout in 1986, disclosed the losses in a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. In a separate letter to investors, <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON> described the retailing climate as `` chaotic'' and said the first quarter results were `` somewhat disappointing although essentially as expected.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing, <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> attributed the first-quarter loss to the effects of `` increased markdowns taken in response to a highly competitive retail environment.'' `` We expect a sluggish economy this Spring but we are determined to run a profitable business, expensed conservatively with improved margins even with modest sales growth,'' read the letter, which was signed by <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Handler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> opened two department stores during the quarter, although it said it does n't plan to open any others until 1991, when one new store is planned. `` That temporary hiatus of new store activity has a double benefit: we can concentrate our energies on improvement of stores already in operation and capital expenditures will be capped at levels significantly below plan, enhancing our cash flow,'' the letter read. <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> said losses from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake, which damaged its <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnin </PERSON> subsidiaries, did not impact the latest results.

 <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday announced a second-quarter loss of more than $ 1 billion due to failing businesses and cheap asset sales in a bid to avoid bankruptcy. The struggling financial services firm said the loss exceeded a previously anticipated $ 600 million decline mainly because of substantially lower-than-expected proceeds from the sale of its core businesses. Integrated reported a loss of $ 1.04 billion, or $ 141.15 a share, on revenue of $ 70.59 million in the April-June quarter. That compared with earnings of $ 12.78 million, or 68 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The once high-flying real estate concern stumbled trying to expand into financial services. Integrated attributed the delay in reporting its second-quarter results to drastic changes since it defaulted on nearly $ 1 billion in debt in June. Integrated stock closed unchanged at 37 -LCB- cents Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. Before announcing the default, Integrated traded at around $ 15 a share. `` Obviously what happened to them in a major way is just shocking,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Fendrich </PERSON>, a managing director for <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Everybody knew that Integrated was a deteriorating situation, but nobody expected it to be an exploding one.'' Integrated is seeking to restructure its debt and raise capital to meet payments on a total of $ 1.75 billion in debt to and avoid seeking bankruptcy court protection from its creditors. The bulk of the second-quarter losses was pinned on write-downs in the value of businesses and assets Integrated has sold, discontinued or plans to sell because of its financial troubles. A major contributor to the loss was the much-reduced sale price for its central financial services businesses. Integrated in November reached agreement to sell the businesses to <ORGANIZATION> Broad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> financial services concern, for a maximum of $ 225 million. It had hoped to receive $ 450 million. That deal, which is pending, is subject to price adjustments at the time of closing that are expected to lower its value. `` These losses reflect the serious impact of our liquidity problems,'' Integrated said in a statement. `` We are attempting to address these problems by working with our creditors to restructure the debt.'' For the first six months of 1989, <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> reported a loss of $ 1.04 billion, or $ 141.93 a share, on revenue of $ 180.8 million, compared with profits of $ 19.86 million, or 59 cents a share, on $ 213.8 million in revenue a year earlier. The write-downs affect the financial services subsidiaries being sold to Broad: <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an investment adviser; <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, its main broker-dealer subsidiary; and <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Integrated said $ 110 million of the loss resulted from restructuring expenses. The firm also cited poor industry conditions for the sale of limited partnerships and real estate investment trusts, an absence of revenue because of the termination or restructuring of some investment programs and higher interest payments because of increased borrowing.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Bond Rating Falls To Lowest In Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL BEEGAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> got the lowest state credit rating in the nation Wednesday when <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's dropped its long-term bond rating from A to BBB. That put <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> a step below <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, which is rated BBB Plus, said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Daicoff </PERSON>, S & amp; P's managing director of municipal finance. Only a year ago, the state's economic boom was such that it was dubbed the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miracle </LOCATION> and nearly carried Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to the White House. Now the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> is struggling with tax hikes to ease an estimated $ 800 million budget deficit for the current fiscal year. `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> is the lowest-rated state,'' Ms. <PERSON> Daicoff </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the other major rating service, dropped <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> last month from A to <ORGANIZATION> Baa </ORGANIZATION> 1, tying it with <LOCATION> Lousiana </LOCATION> as the lowest-rated state. The two services use different ratings and different symbols, so they are not directly comparable, Ms. <PERSON> Daicoff </PERSON> said. State Treasurer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Q. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> said he was n't surprised by S & amp; P's action. `` You ca n't argue with the fact there is a serious shortfall,'' he said. `` The only way it can be addressed is by some very important and difficult cuts in our way of life, plus an input of fresh new revenue streams, whether they be sales tax, sin tax or income tax increases,'' <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' chief financial adviser, <ORGANIZATION> Admininstration </ORGANIZATION> and Finance Secretary <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lashman </PERSON>, said the bonds still carry an investment-grade rating, allowing them to be purchased by major pension funds and other institutional investors. Asked if there was a danger of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' rating falling into the junk-bond category, <PERSON> Lashman </PERSON> said, `` If we do n't get a tax package very soon, we are in serious danger of it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Daicoff </PERSON> said credit rating would n't be upgraded immediately even if the state were to erase the budget deficit of about $ 800 million for the current fiscal year. `` For a higher rating to be assigned, we would have to see a sharp reversal of the financial trends of the last 18 months,'' she said. `` We would also have to be assured that any future fiscal problems are addressed in a prudent fashion. `` S & amp; P expects the state to remain under fiscal stress for some period of time,'' she said. <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> said he hoped the rating would improve before February, the next time the state plans to go to market with long-term debt, but <PERSON> Lashman </PERSON> agreed an upgrading would take a long time. `` The last time this happened, it took us 13 years to get back to a top rating,'' <PERSON> Lashman </PERSON> said. S & amp; P said the downgrading affects $ 4.6 billion in outstanding direct general obligation state bonds. The ratings service also lowered from A to BBB the ratings on $ 2.5 billion in agency debt secured by state guarantees. That debt includes bonds issued by state authorities when the borrowing is not backed up by a stream of dedicated revenue, such as tolls or fees. S & amp; P also lowered the rating on $ 747 million in direct general obligation short-term notes from `` SP-1'' to `` SP-2.'' However, Ms. <PERSON> Daicoff </PERSON> said the state's planned sale of $ 1.2 billion in short-term commercial paper will carry the highest A-1-Plus rating because it is backed by a letter of credit from three Japanese banks. That sale includes $ 700 million in new borrowing and a $ 500 million rollover of existing short-term debt. The borrowing is required for the state to make a $ 1.1 billion aid payment to cities and towns at the end of the month. `` The rating is based on the banks' creditworthyness, not the commonwealth's,'' Ms. <PERSON> Daicoff </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Federated and Allied Department Stores Threaten Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and Allied department stores, owned by the deeply indebted <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, may file for bankruptcy as early as January if lenders do n't agree to restructure their $ 7 billion debt, according to a published report. The Cincinnati-based retailers said in a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filing released Wednesday that they would run out of cash by mid-March and possibly as early as January unless creditors ease repayment schedules. `` What happens depends largely upon the cooperation that is required from our bondholders and other lenders. So we will pursue that cooperation aggressively,'' <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enquirer </ORGANIZATION> for an article to be published in Thursday's editions. According to the newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing said any hesitation by lenders could force the company to seek federal bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. The document said the stores expect to begin discussions with lenders soon, but had no assurance they would reach agreement. `` Hopefully we'll be able to manage our way through this period and conduct the restructuring process on a voluntary basis without going the bankruptcy route,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> stock tumbled 1 to close at 4, a drop of 20 percent in over-the-counter trading Wednesday largely on market rumors of a possible bankruptcy filing, analysts said. The firms cited problems in their <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing that could jeopardize their survival: _ Performance in the fourth quarter _ the period including the Christmas shopping season when the companies make more than half their profits _ has fallen below a forecast that `` left little or no margin for error. _ <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> could already be in default on some of the financial performance clauses in loan agreements, and Allied will likely breach them soon _ <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> must pay off $ 27.6 million of bonds on Jan. 27, and another $ 72.0 million on Feb. `` The burdensome debt load is something that is becoming increasingly difficult to manage,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON> said. `` It requires a tremendous amount of cash infusions.'' <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> took on immense debt, much of it in high interest `` junk bonds,'' as part of their takeover by Canadian real estate magnate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> bought <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> in May 1988 and Allied in December 1986. Their difficulty in meeting the massive interest payments prompted an earlier financial restructuring and the ouster of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> as chairman when <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> bailed out <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in September. Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> put <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, the crown jewel of its retailing empire, up for sale in September after the beleagured company said it was being forced to restructure under the weight of $ 8 billion in debt from its acquisition of Federated and Allied. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> is negotiating with six bidders to sell the <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s chain in February, in order to repay a $ 1.05 billion short-term loan by April 30. But there is no assurance that sale will yield enough to pay the company's debts, the document said. Among <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s holdings is <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> department stores, a 43-store chain based in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gafford </PERSON>, vice president of corporate affairs at <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, downplayed Wednesday's news. `` We're not worried about the possibility of being sold,'' he said. `` This is something that needs to be done by the <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> organization. We're viewing it as business as usual.'' There also is no reason to believe manufacturers will cease merchandise shipments to the retailer, <PERSON> Gafford </PERSON> added. Ms. <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON> said <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and Allied would n't close if they seek federal bankruptcy protection. Chapter 11 allows companies to remain in business while developing a plan to repay their debts. Wednesday's filing follows disclosure Tuesday of worsening losses at Federated and Allied for the third quarter, despite increases in sales. Besides <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> operates <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Abraham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Burdines </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s and the Goldsmith stores in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Allied Stores' operations include Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marsh </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Maas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers-Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marche </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>.

 Cable TV magnate <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> is back in the hunt for <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, trying to negotiate a non-cash deal for <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> to acquire <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, people close to the talks said Wednesday. The entrepreneur needs films to feed <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, his year-old cable network. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, controlled by <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, has just that: a 1,000-picture library of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> movies that include the <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, Rocky and Pink Panther series. Turner already owns rights to the even larger library of <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> films, which he purchased from <LOCATION> Kerkorian </LOCATION> in 1986. If he acquired the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> films and some new MGM movies from <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, he would control rights to about 4,000 pictures. A parade of famous companies and individuals have considered buying <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> since <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> put the studio up for sale a year and a half ago. Bidders such as <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and media mogul <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> have been seeking programming for ventures both here and abroad. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, for example, has started the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION> here and extensive satellite TV ventures in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and in continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He offered $ 1.4 billion for <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>, but was outbid in September by <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> group, which later was unable to get financing for its $ 1.5 billion offer. Those offers were for cash, but <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> is instead trying to negotiate a deal to swap stock in their companies with <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, according to reports in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times and Wall Street Journal that were confirmed Wednesday by a studio executive. Extended by his many ventures, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> `` is not sitting on a pile of cash,'' said the executive, speaking on condition of anonymity. The reports on the stock swap talks are the latest in a series of stories on <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>'s negotiations with buyers including <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and two companies that own a stake in <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>: Denver-based cable giant <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Among others recently interested in <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> was a foreign venture jointly controlled by <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheinberg </PERSON> said Wednesday those negotiations had been only `` loose proposals,'' adding, `` We're certainly not in the running for it now. Neither Turner Broadcasting nor <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> would comment officially on the talks Wednesday, and <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>'s personal spokesman, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, said he had no knowledge of where negotiations stand. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> -RRB- wants to make a deal,'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said. `` The company is in play. But if he ca n't make a deal, he can live with that too. People forget that outside of -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> chairman -RRB- <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> has run a studio longer than anyone in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, and he's been successful at it. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> added, `` He's willing to start back into production'' of films if no deal can be made. Filmmaking has virtually halted at the studio since <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> put the company up for sale in April 1988. Entertainment analyst <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Crowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weedon </ORGANIZATION> brokerage in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> estimated it would take at least $ 250 million a year for two years to get the studio back into full production, but <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said that figure was far too high.

<HEAD>Boeing To Pay $500 Million In Bonuses To Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 500 million in bonuses this month to its employees worldwide, including non-union workers, the company said Wednesday. Of that amount, $ 374 million will go to nearly 107,000 employees in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, including more than 35,000 non-union workers in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area. Both union and non-union workers will receive bonuses of 10 percent, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s largest private employer, said earlier it would give office workers, administrators and supervisors bonuses, but did not give a percentage until Wednesday. Office workers have received bonuses annually, but professionals and administrators last got bonuses three years ago, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>, company spokesman. The 43,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Aerospace Workers in the state got 10 percent bonuses last Friday, averaging more than $ 3,000 each. Under their contract ratified Nov. 20 after a 48-day strike, they will get bonuses of 5 percent next year and 4 percent in 1991. If about 28,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> approve a contract offer, they will receive 10 percent bonuses Dec. 22. The engineers and technical workers have until Dec. 18 to vote on the tentative contract. The proposed offer calls for engineers to get a bonus this year only, but technical workers would get a 5 percent bonus next year and 4 percent the following year. Engineers would get an average bonus of nearly $ 4,000 while technical workers would receive nearly $ 3,000. The 1989 bonuses will also be distributed in four other areas with major <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> operations: <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, $ 72 million; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, $ 18.5 million; <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, $ 7 million; and <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, $ 7 million.

 House Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and other members of the Democratic leadership complained Wednesday that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is relying for economic counsel from aides who have also served as advisers for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> dismissed the complaint as `` a political cheap shot.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself, in a brief exchange with reporters as he left the Oval Office early in the evening, said, `` Mr. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s complaining So what's new?'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and 11 other House Democrats sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel and ethics watchdog <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> saying they were `` deeply troubled by reports that senior officials in the administration may be serving in the dual capacity of advising the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government while simultaneously providing counsel, advice or other services to foreign governments ... corporations or other foreign entities.'' They said the chief <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> expert for the President's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saxonhouse </PERSON>, is an adviser to Japanese financial groups, including a research institute financed by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>. They also noted that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, chairman of the president's council and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief economic adviser, served on the board of a similar institute supported by the Japanese Finance Ministry before he took his current post `` This raises serious questions about conflicts of interest,'' said the Dec. 12-dated letter. The Democrats asked <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> to identify other administration officials who `` serve in a dual capacity'' with any foreign entity. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> had quit the Japanese advisory panel in December 1988, a month before the start of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> was then a <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> economics professor; he had been a top adviser toBush during the 1988 campaign. <PERSON> Saxonhouse </PERSON> is an unpaid adviser on a Japanese ministry board that has not met in two years, said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Saxonhouse </PERSON> works only part time for the White House, and `` there's no conflict of interest.'' <PERSON> Saxonhouse </PERSON> is not subject to ethics rules that cover the White House staff. `` <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s a Japan-basher, that's all,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> could not be immediately reached for comment. He is in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, his staff said. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 on a platform of tough trade laws to restrict imports from countries with big trade imbalances with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, such as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The Democrats' complaint was sparked by an article in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s lobbying efforts in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and its ties to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> academics Also signing the letter were Democrats <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority whip; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, the chief deputy whip; <PERSON> Steny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Caucus; <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, vice chairman of the caucus; <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaptur </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Bob </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>.
