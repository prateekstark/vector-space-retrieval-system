 Grand opera as grand as it gets filled the Metropolitan Opera stage in the first performance this season of <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> conducted on Friday night, bringing out the opera's orchestral glories and at times threatening to drown out the singers But the soloists had powerful lungs and the large chorus soared vocally over the orchestra. Tenor <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Shicoff </PERSON> was <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON>, betrothed to <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, daughter of the French king. After they meet and fall in love they discover that a treaty has given her to <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The fallout from that, plus the Spanish Inquisition, is plenty for an opera, even one as long as `` <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Shicoff </PERSON> began too loud but quickly settled into a well-sung, feeling portrayl. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> sang <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>. Her voice is beautiful, smooth and large. At the end of the third long scene, singing to a banished countess, Miss Price sounded tired. But she recovered before Act 2. Both <PERSON> Shicoff </PERSON> and Miss Price were singing their parts for the first time at the Met. Baritone <PERSON> Bernd </PERSON> <PERSON> Weikl </PERSON> as <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> was more brusque than subtle. He sounded as though he were pushing for volume. <PERSON> Ruggero </PERSON> <PERSON> Raimondi </PERSON>, his voice very focused, was impressive as King <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tatiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Troyanos </PERSON>, always a favorite of the Met audience, was fine as Princess <PERSON> Eboli </PERSON>. She did n't wear the eye patch that was part of the costume when this production was new 10 years ago. The real <ORGANIZATION> Eboli </ORGANIZATION> wore one but since `` Don Carlo'' is more drama than history and the stage eye patch was distracting, Miss <PERSON> Troyanos </PERSON> was better off without it. The auto-da-fe scene was lavish with clerics, onlookers and flag wavers. The royals and Grand Inquisitor -LRB- Jan-Hendrik Rootering -RRB- wore black trimmed in gold. <PERSON> Hei-Kyung </PERSON> <PERSON> Hong </PERSON> sounded celestial as the celestial voice. However, in this staging, she welcomed those burned into heaven before anybody lighted the fire. `` <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON>'' was last sung at the Met during the 1985-86 season.

 With record temperatures dipping to 75 degrees below zero and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s cold snap showing no sign of breaking, the governor activated the state's emergency services agency Friday. `` We're not declaring an emergency, yet,'' Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said in a brief radio address, but added that the weather forecast offers little hope for a break. `` There's no end in sight, apparently,'' he said. <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said Alaskans in need of help should first call local authorities, and then to the state agency, which will be open 24 hours a day. He also announced a toll-free number for the agency. The community of <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> posted the state's low of 75 below zero overnight and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> diesel-powered trucks were among the few vehicles still operating. The temperature warmed to minus 59 by 11 a.m. Friday. <LOCATION> Sitka </LOCATION>, with the high of 43, was tropical by comparison. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s largest city, <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, shivered through a high of minus 15 Even light winds pushed wind chill factors to minus 100 degrees or colder.

 The 300 cowboys in town this week ai n't here to rope steers or whoop it up at a saloon. No sirree, mister, these folks are the biggest bunch of prose-packin', simile-slingin', versifying-est cowboys you ever saw, and they're here for the annual Cowboy Poetry Gathering. It ai n't all dogie doggerel, and you better smile when you quote'em, pardner. Upwards of 7,000 visitors have jammed this northeastern <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> town of 13,000 for the five day-event, which began Wednesday and wraps up Sunday. The area's 40 motels have been booked for weeks. Ten-gallon hats dot Railroad Avenue and Commercial Street, and more spill out of the Branding Iron Bar. The crowds have come to hear the cowboys recite their bunkhouse ballads, sing soulful songs and tell of hard and high times on the range. The activities have filled every available meeting place in town, from the <ORGANIZATION> Elko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> to the bar at the <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>'s Hotel. The buckaroos don fancy duds for the gathering _ broad-brimmed Stetsons, silver buckles and handmade pointy-toed boots _ but their sunburned faces, calloused hands and faraway gaze tell their own tales of hard and solitary lives. One such poet is <PERSON> Waddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who runs 2,000 head of cattle on a ranch near <LOCATION> Jiggs </LOCATION>. Before he came to the gathering, he had to make sure there was enough hay put out and find a baby sitter for his five children. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> began writing verse during long winters on the range. Like most cowboy poets, he did n't show his work to many people because poetry did n't quite fit the cowboy image. But the first cowboy poetry gathering five years ago brought a lot of sagebrush scribes off the prairie. One of <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s poems tells the plight of <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON>, found behind a bar with his throat cut. When `` they got him to the hospital he would n't sign a complaint against the fella who done it because he was a friend of his.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, who will sing and tell stories at the Saturday night finale, are big guns in the cowboy entertainment world. They have ben on `` The Tonight Show,'' and Black's records are available anywhere Western music is sold. Black, a veterinarian from <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, earns a six-figure income from his performances. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahan </PERSON>, a singer, songwriter and poet from <LOCATION> Bellvue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, who claims to have the only yodeling dog, recited this verse at one gathering: `` Two things in life that I really love, That's women and horses, of that I'm sure of. So when I die please tan my hide, And tool me into a saddle so fine, And give me to a cowgirl that likes to ride, So in the hereafter I may rest, Between the two things that I love the best.'' Besides stage performances, there are informal sessions for greenhorn poets, singers and storytellers. Exhibitions display handmade saddles, bits, spurs and other cowboy regalia. <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Folklife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which coordinates the gathering, said one of the center's biggest challenges is keeping the cowboy poetry pure. That's why they've come up with an ironclad rule: Every participant has to make a living on the range. No `` drugstore cowboys'' allowed.

 A robber who forgot to cut eyeholes in the plastic garbage bag he wore in a botched motel holdup was sentenced Friday to 25 years in prison. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Creswell </PERSON>, 51, was sentenced to concurrent terms for that holdup and two other armed robberies which he admitted, according to <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Milam </PERSON>, assistant district attorney for Beauregard Parish. <PERSON> Milam </PERSON> said <PERSON> Creswell </PERSON> previously was convicted of four other armed robberies in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Creswell </PERSON>'s undoing <PERSON> Milam </PERSON> said, occurred in May, a week after he held up a clothing store twice last May. <PERSON> Milam </PERSON> said <PERSON> Creswell </PERSON>, knife in hand, was pulling a garbage bag over his head as he entered the lobby of the Park Motel, according to a statement by motel clerk <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON>. <PERSON> Creswell </PERSON> suddenly realized he forgot to make eyeholes in the bag, the clerk told police. `` So he started pulling on the bag to try to put some holes in it,'' <PERSON> Milam </PERSON> said. `` And then he asked for the money. `` Well, she said she was n't going to give him any money and he left,'' <PERSON> Milam </PERSON> said.

 One of the largest processors of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s favorite snack food is hoping to catapult the product to national popularity with a new brand: Presidential Pork Rinds `` I'll be on the street with them next week,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>, sales manager for <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. The brand is a take-off on the president's well-known predilection for the porcine product. A gift jar of pork rinds replaced <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s crystal container of jellybeans on the table at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first Cabinet meeting this week. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has done wonders for pork rinds here this year,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Rickard </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Snack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` My view is, ` Skins are in. Pork rinds in'89,''' said <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>, who sent 3,000 pounds of the crunchy, puffed snack to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the presidential inaugural ball and in return got an invitation to the event. Pork rinds are fried pieces of hog skin, cooked in hog fat, stored in pellets for 30 days and fried again for 60 seconds in oil heated to 400 degrees, `` at which time they explode like popcorn,'' <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, with a plant on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s south side, supplies pork rind pellets to Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Frito-Lay </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marketer of pork rinds, and other companies, <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> handles about 50 million pounds of pork skin annually. He said pork rinds compare favorably to peanuts in fat content and contain a high percentage of protein. Nutrition experts, however, say the salted snack has enough calories, fat and sodium to make it a poor food for all but the most physically active people with the lowest cholesterol levels. The <ORGANIZATION> Snack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said pork rind sales totaled $ 195 million in 1987, a figure dwarfed by sales of potato chips, which enjoyed $ 3.8 billion in sales in the $ 8 billion salty snack food market.

 The collision of two vehicles that killed three students and a man just 100 yards from the school has brought many in the town together to mourn. Many students stopped by a salvage yard to see the smashed remains of a classmate's car on Friday, a day after three people were killed in the vehicle.

 The debacle for <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in a major state election this past week was the latest in a series of reverses for the prime minister, who will face his own voter test by the end of the year. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, 44, had a dream start as prime minister _ his party won four-fifths of the 542 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 _ but allegations of corruption, a belligerent opposition headed by a former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> colleague and successive defeats in state elections raise doubts about his return for a second term. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has lost 11 of its last 18 state elections. The latest defeat was Jan. 21 in populous <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, where it won only 26 of the 234 state assembly seats. `` Gandhi's problem is a failure at the political level,'' said <PERSON> Bhabani </PERSON> <PERSON> Sengupta </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s foremost political analysts. `` It's a pity because he came in with a tremendous amount of goodwill and a tremendous amount of promise. In January 1985, the former airline pilot was sworn in as prime minister after his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> swept the highest number of parliamentary seats ever won by a single party since <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became independent in 1947. The victory was ascribed mainly to the wave of sympathy for <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> after his mother, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, was assassinated three months earlier. But it was helped also by <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s `` Mr. Clean'' image, which sprang from his age and inexperience in what many people saw as the dirty world of politics. His stewardship gave the government an unprecedented honeymoon with the press. Even normally anti-establishment newspapers were enthusiastic. `` The parliamenary election <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> won four years ago ... has created an illusory world for him,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Hindustan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, a usually pro-government newspaper, said in an editorial this week. `` This kind of mandate breeds dangerous smugness.'' The cracks did not appear for almost a year. The first murmurs against <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> began with his inability to solve the lingering problem of a murderous Sikh insurgency in the northern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. The low point came in 1987, when newspapers claimed the Swedish arms company <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 50 million in bribes to secure a government contract for artillery guns. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> denied involvement. A parliamentary committee cleared the government of complicity, but the allegations persist and are still under investigation. In the midst of the allegations, V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who had held the defense and finance portfolios in <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s Cabinet, quit the party after building a reputation as a crusader against corruption. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> went on to win a parliamentary by-election as an independent running on a clean-government platform. In the past six months, he has been largely successful in persuading national opposition parties and regional parties to form a national coalition opposed to <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 41-year history, no single opposition party has ever posed a serious threat to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Instead, the opposition has been splintered among powerful local parties and a vast array of national parties. The only time <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ever lost a national election was in 1977 when the opposition united after Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> imposed an emergency and banned political activity. `` If the opposition is united and can present itself as a creditable alternative, then the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Party -RRB- will be in very serious trouble,'' said <PERSON> Sengupta </PERSON>, the political analyst. At least seven parties have joined the anti-Gandhi front, and together they control seven of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 25 states. Last week's polls in <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> voted the front's <ORGANIZATION> Dravida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Munnetra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kazhagam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> into power, and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> trailed a poor third behind another regional party. `` It will be dangerous for the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to believe that what happened in <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> was only a regional phenomenon,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Hindustan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. `` No state is out of the national mainstream. What -LRB- happens -RRB- at the polling booth in <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> has also an impact on the rest of the country.''

 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must be ready to use the `` crowbar'' of retaliation to open world markets, says President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominee for top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade negotiator, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice as housing secretary called the `` appalling problem'' of homelessness his top priority. `` Retaliation can not be the goal of our policy _ in fact, it signals the failure to open foreign markets,'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said Friday before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved her nomination as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative. `` But the credible threat of retaliation provides essential leverage in our market-opening efforts,'' said the former secretary of housing and urban development in the Ford administration. `` Thus, actual retaliation will be used, albeit reluctantly, to preserve the credibility of this threat.'' Pledging to fight to open global markets `` with a crowbar if necessary,'' she said: `` We have to have our agreements enforced,'' she said. `` And where our partners are violating our agreements we must take action.'' The panel was unanimous in recommending <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation of the 54-year-old <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> native to succeed <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, who has been tapped by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for secretary of agriculture. A confirmation hearing has yet to be scheduled for <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. Appearing before another <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel, former Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said about homelessness: `` I acknowledge that it is a very severe problem _ it is an appalling problem. It is an emergency problem, and I'm willing to treat it as the highest priority, immediately, of my new leadership at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>.'' The 1988 candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination avoided committing himself on most specific spending questions but did pledge to be an advocate for increased federal efforts to house the poor. He promised to seek full funding of legislation passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to provide emergency shelter for the homeless, called the McKinney Act, and said he favored expanding it in some areas. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he visited privately with leaders of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s riot-torn <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> areas last weekend when in that city for the Super Bowl. He said that if confirmed he planned to visit blighted inner cities and places where the homeless cluster. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> banking committee took no vote on <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s nomination, but the hearing was filled with bipartisan praise for the nominee, who is expected to win confirmation easily. A committee vote may come next week, after <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> answers additional written questions. Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> sought to dampen concern that she could become vulnerable to conflict-of-interest charges because she and her attorney husband, <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, have represented foreign law clients. `` Let me address the question of potential conflicts of interest right away,'' she said. `` There are none.''

 Three congressmen with defense-related committee assignments say they were unaware of receiving illegal corporate contributions through a consultant who pleaded guilty in the government's investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> corruption. `` The circumstances of this contribution were totally unknown to me ... and I am returning it immediately,'' Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., said in a statement after learning Friday that his campaign had received $ 1,000 illegally Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, D-Ga., said he was `` extremely upset'' by the news that <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 76, of <LOCATION> Mineola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, had given money to his campaign He said he too would send the money back. Between 1982 and 1988 <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> contributed over $ 25,000 to political campaigns at the direction of his consulting client, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a giant computer company that does work for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, prosecutors said. Federal election law says individuals may give $ 1,000 in general and primary campaigns, but corporations are prohibited from donating money. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> executive, entered guilty pleas to a variety of charges in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court in the latest development in the Pentagon investigation. Also pleading guilty before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> was <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, a civilian purchasing official with the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, 52, admitted he accepted bribes in exchange for providing confidential information on pending contracts to consultants and companies. He could face up to 20 years in prison and a fine of as much as $ 500,000. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts of making political contributions in the name of another, namely his client. He could face up to four years in prison and a fine of $ 400,000. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was paid by <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON>, which later merged into <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, and was `` asked by representatives of Sperry-Unisys to make numerous contributions in his name.'' Besides the campaigns of <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> also contributed in 1987 and 1988 to the campaigns of Reps. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, D-Md., and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>., prosecutors `` It angers me that someone would give my campaign illegal money,'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> said they knew nothing about the source of the money when it was given. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, said his boss was also in the dark about the contribution <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, 55, pleaded guilty Friday to conspiracy to defraud the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and to aiding and abetting in making false statements to the government. He could face up to 10 years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, who first worked for <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>' predecessor, <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburbs, was involved in a complicated scheme in which $ 2,000 was funneled to the election campaign of former Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., prosecutors said <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> chaired the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> defense appropriations subcommittee until his defeat last November. Prosecutors said the contractor paid consultants with the understanding that they would contribute an unspecified portion of the funds to political campaigns. In December 1986, <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> collected two undated checks of $ 1,000 each from two men and steered them to the `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> Campaign Committee.'' <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> repeatedly denied any wrongdoing while he was in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Friday's pleas are part of the federal government's two-year-old investigation into the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 150-billion-a-year procurement practices. The case includes allegations that private consultants, hired by defense contractors, bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials to obtain inside information that gave companies an edge in securing contracts.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are urging President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to reassure savings and loan depositors by swiftly developing a plan to pump more money into the ailing government insurance fund for S & amp; Ls. `` Public confidence is so precarious today that it is imperative that a comprehensive approach be presented soon,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, the second-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` The exact nature is not as important as the fact that a serious package be presented,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought Friday to stem nervousness following scattered reports that some S & amp; L depositors withdrew their money after learning that the administration is considering a 25-cent fee on every $ 100 in federally insured accounts. `` The savings and loan deposits are backed by the full faith and credit of the government and they are sound, they are good,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters at the White House. `` I want to assure the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people of that and that's not going to change.'' However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he has made no decisions on a plan for the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L problem and would not rule out the deposit insurance fee. `` There seems to be some controversy around it, but that does n't mean that any thinking along those lines should cease,'' the president said Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's disarray on the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis is contributing to a growing nervousness among depositors `` Savings and loans are receiving a heavy run of calls from depositors who are confused and concerned about the reports of a new tax on their deposits,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. `` In some areas there have been higher than expected withdrawals of funds.'' <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, disputed <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' assertion, saying it was based on `` an inartful distillation of calls made by somebody on the -LRB- committee -RRB- staff.'' However, in an interview a day before, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said: `` There have been cases where they -LRB- depositors -RRB- say, ` I do n't like what I heard on TV, I'm taking my money out.''' <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> board spokesman <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> said a survey of thrift institutions Thursday night showed `` no outflows of any significance that we can attribute to anything that's been said.'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> accused the administration of being `` extremely careless'' in floating the deposit fee trial balloon and called on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to `` take a personal hand in clarifying the administration's proposal. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been studying the S & amp; L problem since the fall and is expected to present <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with its recommendations next week. Department officials have been briefing members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on some of the options under consideration, in addition to a deposit fee. Rep. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., a senior member of the banking committee, said <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> is talking about borrowing about $ 45 billion, roughly the amount needed over and above the $ 38 billion committed last year, and is examining the full range of options of how to pay it off The laundry list includes using interest on <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> funds that is now paid into the general fund, or tapping the retained earnings of the industry-owned regional <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Study: Above Average Air Fare Increases at Hub Airports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Air fares since 1985 generally have increased much faster than average at airports largely controlled by single airlines, according to a new government study of those hub operations. `` The present situation at hub airports is intolerable,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., said Friday in releasing the study prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> He blamed the increases on a lack of competition at some airports in the wake of deregulation of the airline industry in the 1970s. Under deregulation, most airlines have adopted `` hub and spoke'' operations to help lower their costs. The concept involves having flights from smaller airports feed into a central airport, or hub, where passengers make connections for their ultimate destinations. The study found that air fares rose substantially above national averages from 1985 to 1988 at more than a half-dozen hub airports dominated by single airlines: <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The increases, in most instances, were twice or nearly three times greater than the air fare portion of the Consumer Price Index during the same period. The study looked at average round-trip ticket prices for passengers beginning or ending their flights at the hubs. Fares rose an average of 11.1 percent across the nation from 1985 to 1988, the study said. It said fares for the biggest carriers at two major airports either rose less than the national average or dropped over the three-year period. From 1985 to 1988, according to the study: _ <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> fares rose 34 percent over three years at <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, where the airline had 89 percent of the market last year _ <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> fares rose 25 percent at <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, where the company had 81 percent of the market _ <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> fares rose 27 percent at <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, where the airline had 62 percent of the market _ Northwest fares rose 21 percent at <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, where the airline had 77 percent of the market _ <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> fares rose 35 percent at <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, where the airline had 67 percent of the market _ Delta fares rose 26 percent at <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> The airline had 77 percent of the market. _ Delta fares rose 5 percent at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where the airline controls 62 percent of the market _ <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> fares dropped 6 percent at <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, where the airline had 80 percent of the market The study focused, however, on Lambert-St. Louis International Airport and the effects of a 1986 merger that made <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> the dominant carrier of passengers in and out of the city <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, disagreed with <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>'s reading of the report. He said the study did not link the increases to the airline's control of the market at its <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> hub. The <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> study found that <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> fares at <LOCATION> Lambert </LOCATION> for non-stop roundtrip travel increased 22.7 percent from the first half of 1985 to the first half of 1988. The airline component of the CPI rose 11.1 percent during the same period. `` I do n't there is any correlation between the fare increases and the hub operation,'' said <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>. He attributed the increases to `` market forces.'' The report did not examine in detail the other airports. It cited the fares at other concentrated hubs only to show that <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s air fares had not increased faster than comparable airports across the nation. However, the study cautioned, `` Hub concentration alone does not explain why fares change or how much they change.''

 Here is a transcript of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s news conference Friday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: Harmony and peace in here. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- First, I sound worse than I feel. But let me _ Q. What's wrong with you? A. A slight cold. But it's been a full week since inauguration. I just wanted to stop by, under our new policy, give you an update. I've been talking this week about ethics, and the emphasis is not, believe me, a fad or some passing fancy. We're going to be hearing more about it, I think a lot more. In broader terms, I'm trying to set high standards for government service _ duty, honor, personal sacrifice for the common good. And I want to assemble a government that the people of this nation can be proud of, that's our goal, that's our mission. We did appoint this week, as you know, a new commission on ethics. We've got two able chairman, vice chairman _ Judge -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Malcolm </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Wilkey </PERSON> and General <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>. We appointed that commission, started a fresh, constructive dialogue with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on both sides of the aisle. I'm pleased with the way those initial meetings have gone, and so we're ready to roll. I think it's been officially announced that we're going to _ certainly to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, then on to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which I'm looking forward to very much. And then also we'll be stopping for a relatively brief stop in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on the way back from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. We've had other invitations. That's about all we can do. And on a nostalgic basis, needless to say, we're _ <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and I are looking forward in a very personal way to going back to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Now with no further ado, I'll be glad to take your questions. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>?

<TEXT>
 Q. Mr. President, you said, before you became president, that you supported <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision on a 50 percent pay raise for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and that you might have something more to say about it once you got to the Oval Office. Most of the polls show that the vast majority of Americans oppose that pay raise. Now you're president. What's your view on that pay increase? A. Well, I did say I supportd it, and I do support it. A raise is overdue; there's no question about that. There are some good things in this. The reform of the honorarium, payments for these speeches, I think is very, very good. I think it's good government. It's a complicated formulation. There are some elements that bother people, including me. But the president did consider all this carefully. He went forward with the commission's recommendation. And that, because of the way it works in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and the ball is clearly in their court, it leaves us with either the commission recommendation or nothing. And so seeing the problems as I do, I still feel that I should not go about undoing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> decision. Yeah, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>? Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, your trial balloon on the S & amp; Ls taxing savings and checking accounts has fallen like a lead balloon. Are you dropping that plan? Do you have any other plans in the works? A. In the first place, I think it ` sa little absurd to be commenting on a facet, a possible facet, of solving a problem, when it has n't even come to You're talking about speculating on something that has n't even reached the desk of the president, even as an option, to say nothing of its being a proposal. And so _ Q. _ come from your people. A. Well, as an option, not as a proposal. And I think you're right, there seems to be some controversy around it.

 But that does n't mean that any thinking along those lines should cease. But, I'm going to reserve comment until I actually have it presented to me. And I expect this is the first of many such things that's going to happen of this nature. I will say this, that the savings and loans' deposits are backed by the full faith and credit of the government. And they are sound. They are good _ dollar good. And I just want to assure the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people of that. And nothing is going to change in that regard. But, in terms of this one idea, let them float it around. It does n't bother me for a lot of ideas to be considered and debated. Q. The reaction is very negative; the public reaction and congressional reaction. Will that enter into your decision? A. Anything I do on savings and loans or when we get into this budget deficit reduction program _ look, I do n't expect it's all going to be sweetness and harmony and light. The minute we get those proposals up there on Feb. 9, I expect we're going to have other firestorms swirling around. But, I have not made decisions on this one. I'll wait till I get all the facts, call them as I see them, and hope that we can convince the American people that that's the way to go. Yes, <PERSON> Brit </PERSON>? Q. Mr. President, you've set a tone of high-mindedness and propriety this week with your emphasis on ethics, also bipartisanship in your discussions with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Beyond those matters of process and tone, sir, what would you like the country and the world to say is the message of your first week in office as to what your administration is about? A. Reaching out to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. I really am serious about this trying to get more of a bipartisan foreign policy, for example. And though we have n't addressed that specifically in terms of issues, I have addressed it in broad terms to the members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with whom I've met here and with whom I've met over in the residence. And, so, I'd like to signal an era of real openness with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Look, I know we're going to have conflicts, Brit, and I know we're going to run up against each other. But, I want to start with that approach, and we're going to _ we're in a broad review, as you've heard from my various nominees as they appear before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, on specific areas of foreign policy. But a message would be taking steps to make clear to the congressional leadership that that's what I want to do. The other one, as I mentioned, is trying to set a tone in terms of conflict of interest that I hope will serve us in good stead.

 Q. Mr. President, there seems to be some question about just how long your `` no tax'' pledge applies. Is that a one-year pledge, a two-year pledge, a four-year pledge? A. I'd like it to be a four-year pledge. And _ Q. Is it a four-year pledge? A. I'd like it to be a four-year pledge, yeah. Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s been over in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> meeting with the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> has said, and so has <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, that it's too early for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to meet with <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. On what level would it be appropriate for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to meet with an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> official? An assistant secretary of state, for example? A. We changed the policy on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, on dealing with the _ I mean, as change came about in the policy on communicating with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, it was based on their acceptance of three principles. As long as they stay hooked and stay committed to those three principles, we will have, when appropriate, meetings with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. I have n't given any thought at all to what _ what _ when a meeting with the _ Chairman <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> with an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> official, is appropriate. And I would wait to see how we go forward. The point in talking to them is to try to facilitate peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. And it seems to me that if there's some logical step that requires high-level sign-off by various participants over there, then, and then only, would it be proper to elevate the meetings to that level. We're just starting. You crawl before you walk. We're just starting to talk to them, because they have _ dramatically, I'd say _ agreed to the _ to the principles that are part of our policy. Q. Let me ask you again in that regard. You said in a wire service interview the other day that you needed to have some foreign policy initiative early in your administration. It seems the Soviet relationship is going on the back burner while you discuss the nuclear force structure, for example. In what area are you going to try to move forward? Central America? The <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION>? Where? A. All of them. But we've got to have a little time. We're not going to let this Soviet thing put us in a mood of _ mode of foot-draggers. We're going to be out front. There's no reason to suggest that all we have to do is react to a speech by the general secretary. I want to take the offense in moving this relationship forward and doing _ taking steps that are in the interest of the free _ freedom around the world, whether it's in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, or in strengthening our alliance. But there's plenty of trouble spots. One of them, as you mentioned, I think _ <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ but we need to complete the reviews. But I ca n't tell you, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, which one will become _ where you will see the first major initiative, whether it's going to be the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, whether it's going to be <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We've got problems, of course, that afflict the whole continent and other continents in this Third World debt problem; and then, of course, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But, no, I do n't want to play defense, and I do n't want to look like we're foot-dragging, just waiting around to _ to, you know, let others set the agenda. But, prudence is the order of the day. And when you're gunning for something as important as a bilaterally supported policy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, it does take a little time. I've only been here less than a week. Yes?

 Q. As you know, the minimum wage has been frozen for even longer than congressional pay raises. Since you support a large increase in pay for the most affluent 1 percent of the country, will you favor pushing for an increase in the minimum wage, which would benefit the lowest income groups in the country, as part of your promise in your inaugural address to reach out to all the people? A. I would _ I've always said that my position on minimum wage is that I would want it linked to a training wage, to a differential of sorts, so that you do n't throw people out of work by raising the minimum wage. And I'm not one who has felt that the minimum wage is the key to economic prosperity for the lowest _ people on the lowest end of the economic spectrum.

 A. OK. Q Are you concerned, from the standpoint of perception, that you're supporting a pay raise for a high-income group and not pushing on an equal basis for a lower-income group will give the public's perception that you're lobbying for a wealthy sector of the country? A. No, I'm not concerned about that perception because _ but I am troubled by certain aspects of the proposal, as I think I've indicated _ the pay raise proposal But, we're down to the crunch here. The recommendation's up there on the hill _ it's either yea or nay. I mean, it's one way or another. But, I do n't think that would be fair at all. I think the main thing in terms of the question you raised _ jobs. How do we continue to create jobs, keep it going? And I've given you one ingredient that I think has to be a part of the _ of any consideration of the minimum wage, but as I've indicated, I'm flexible on how that should be accomplished But, I'm not sure that one could make a connection between the minimum wage and more employment. I think you can _ if you raise the minimum wage without this difference, so I think you will reduce employment. So, I think the main thing in the area you're talking about is, how do we increase economic opportunity? And maybe there is a way to do it, but I do n't think it would be fair to say, when you take a pay raise that affects a tiny fraction _ judges and congressmen _ that that has a broad economic impact on the country. I've expressed some concern about it, but for other reasons. Yes? Q. Do you agree with Senator Tower's testimony, in which he does n't seem to believe that the SDI program as envisioned by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is likely? And if you do agree with it, can you expand on that, please? A. No. I think I should wait and see a little more what <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> means. My position has not chaned on SDI. Q. Which is? <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> said that he does n't believe that a large-scale SDI would protect the population as envisioned by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ A. I better _ yes? Q. Do you disagree with that? <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saul </PERSON>, before I comment on Tower's testimony, I better read it. If he's talking about a shield so impenetrable that you have no _ that that eliminates the need for any kind of other defense, I probably would agree with that, certainly short-run. But I better cover by waiting until I see what he said. The standees _ two standees alone. Q. Thank you. The first action taken by your secretary of state was to order the boarding up of embassy in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Does that indicate that this administration and this country then has no influence with the rebels, and you are now fearful of chaos and massacres there? And to what extent did you discuss this with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> the other day? A. I did not discuss it with him the other day. And what it indicates is a prudent policy to protect a handful of American life. And it's a step that other countries have taken in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. There is _ certainly I think we'd all agree _ there is uncertainty about what follows. I'm convinced the Soviets will continue their withdrawal, and well they should. But it is simply a prudent way in which to protect life. I think we've had meeting after meeting with Afghan rebels, and there's no question in their mind how we feel about, say, a Soviet presence in that country. But I think there's a lot of uncertainty, and there's enough uncertainty that a secretary of state was taking prudent action in this regard.

 Q. What role do you see for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after the Soviets withdraw, in that country? A. Catalytic role for helping bring about stability, hopefully in a government where the people have a lot of say, and it wo n't be easy. Yes, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>? Q. Mr. President, I'd like to try the pay raise one last time. As you just said, it's not just for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and it's not just for federal judges. It's for a lot of senior officials in the government, political appointees. You also have told some reporters in recent days that you're concerned about the long-term pension implications of all these larger salaries. Would n't you be happier with a pay raise that's a little bit less rich than 50 percent? A. I do n't have that option to get into that now. I have, I think, expressed myself in the past on separating out some of these categories. But we're not _ regrettably, you're never dealing with just the way I would like it to be. And so I'll just leave it that what _ my earlier statement. Q. Sir, this is a thematic question. You've had a week on the job. Has it been easier or tougher than you expected? Any surprises? And did you find the note in your underwear? A. No note in the underwear. And it's been a good, easy week, and I expect it will change dramatically in the days ahead. But my view is to _ if it were n't for the cold _ `` Smile and enjoy it while you can,'' because I can already sense, you know, looking forward to a little more _ a little more confrontation out there. Q. Have there been any surprises, sir? A. None particularly, no. It _ it _ and I think one of the reasons is that I've been around here in a different role for eight years, and then in and out on other jobs. So it's _ but there's the, still the wonder of it all. I mean, it still feels different, but not surprises. Q. A follow-up, sir! A. You've already a follow-up! Nice try. <PERSON> Rita </PERSON>? -LRB- Laughter -RRB-. Q. Mr. President, there seems to be some brouhaha about the fact that <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s not an actual member of the Cabinet, as are the U.S.T.R. and the <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> directors. In light of the fact that you emphasized drugs as an overriding consideration in your campaign, and also that public opinion polls show consistently this is among the top priorities of the public, why is n't he in the Cabinet? And do you foresee that you might change your mind on that? A. No. The reason he is n't in the Cabinet is that I've tried to reduce down the numbers of full Cabinet members. And I think that <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s time is best spent not worrying about agricultural subsidies, but _ when we have a meeting on agriculture _ but concentrating on drugs. To the degree there's symbolism that this means I think it's less important, I'd like to knock that down hard. And I have to do that in substantive ways, sitting at his side as we meet with his peers at Cabinet level, making clear to them that I will be insisting on cooperation as he asks for the support of the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary for military assets on interdiction; as he asks for the support of the education secretary on certain educational initiatives. But the Cabinet rank is there, giving him the standing that I think the job not only requires, but demands, and I think his _ I think the idea of not sitting through Cabinet meetings that have nothing to do with that subject should be the reason that _ a rationale for having Cabinet-level but not being in all those meetings. I've seen _ I'm glad he mentioned this, because I think there's been some feeling, `` Well, that means I'm less interested in drugs. That's not right. I'm not _ I'm very interested in the economic statistics, but our chief of economic advisers is not a Cabinet member, as he has been designated by previous presidents. Our chief of staff, in whom I have full confidence, is not a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member, but I think we have a very strong chief of staff set-up. Over here, way up in the window _ an innovative stance.

 Q. I wonder if I could just touch on the issue of Third World debt. There are many experts who are saying that, if there is any danger for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, it's in how greatly leveraged it is opposed to terms of corporate indebtedness and Third World debt. And they say that the S & amp; L crisis, for example, is simply a subsumed feature of this. Do you see this as a real problem that you're going to address aggressively? And what kind of steps would you take to overcome the high proportionality of debt to equity that exists in the economy now? A. The question of corporate debt _ the role _ on that one, the role of th White House and the role of the federal government ought to be to do its level best to keep a strong economy. And I do n't believe that it's the government role to assign levels beyond which a corporation ca n't borrow. In terms of Third World debt, we do have a responsibility, and a lot of that's going to be working with the private banks and others, and, again, that's going to be _ we'll have some recommendations. We have to have them pretty soon on that question. That _ I'm not sure I got to the substance of your question there. But I do n't _ separating out those two things. Q. _ in the reported differences that you have with <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s testimony in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week with regard to interest rates and monetary policy? A. I'll be honest with you. I do n't think I'm far apart from Chairman <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> at all _ far apart. There may be some differences. He is, because of the plant capacity utilization, he is more concerned about inflationary pressures than I am right now. Seems to me there's an area of difference. But basically and generally speaking, I think we're in _ we're fairly close together Yes? Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, by spending your first week dwelling as you have on ethics, are n't you voicing an implicit criticism of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's record _ ethical record? A. No. Q. Then why else was it necessary to declare `` national ethics week,'' so to speak? A. Because I feel strongly about it. Q. On that _ also on that line, sir? A. No, she's first and then you. Need to cool off on that one. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, during _ given your strong anti-tax stand in the campaign, why are you allowing Mr. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> to consider as an option for the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls a tax increase? A. I'm not _ he has thrown out a lot of different possibilities in discussions we've had. We have people that are experts on what a tax is. I would refer you to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, who is the head of the <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>. And he's the guy that defined that very well up there, with the `` duck test'' on the hill. And _ Q. So you do n't think it's a tax? A. Well, I'm just saying I'm not prepared to say what I think on it right now till I hear from it, because the more I discuss it, the more you all go out and say this is something that I'm considering, when I'm not. It has n't come to me yet. But I've been around for a long time, and I do n't remember hearing people talk about the fee that went into covering the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> as a tax. I do n't remember people writing that before. But, I'm not trying to get into the fight anymore right now. I'll be back _ yes, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>? Q. You've mentioned ethics in a number of ways, and you've talked about the value of service. The last few days, we picked up the headlines in the papers, and they've read, `` The president has _ President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ has a $ 5 million book deal. He's got a $ 50,000-a-speech deal.'' With all respect for the office and the former president, do you think it's appropriate to cash in on the presidency? A. I do n't know whether I'd call it `` cashing in.'' I expect every president has written his memoirs and received money for it. Indeed, I read that a former president _ was it <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>? <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> got half a million bucks _ that's when half a million really meant something. I mean, you know _ so I think there's plenty of tradition that goes with presidents writing memoirs and being paid for it.

 Q. But, you've also talked about perceptions. Is there a perception problem here? A. No, because I think there's been a long history of that. And, I do n't think it's ever been challenged as inappropriate. Yes? Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, would you try to clear up the continuing controversy over the reports of disagreements on abortion between your nominee for health and human services and yourself that _ are you in sync? Is he in sync _ A. Yes. Q. _ with you? Does it matter? Do you have to be absolutely in sync as long as, once in office, he would support your position? A. Well, I think that last point is the important point. But, also, we are in sync. And, so, I have a person who has stood in front of you all when I nominated him and said that. And I have no reason to think anything different. Yes? Q. Mr. President, a few moments ago, you talked about, on your no-new-taxes pledge, the idea that you'd like it to be a four-year pledge. And that does appear to be a softening of language from the campaign. I wonder, has anything that Mr. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> or any of your advisers told you changed your mind about the duration of that pledge _ revenues needed and so on? A. No. That has n't changed my mind _ anything in the last few days of talking like that. Yes? Q. Mr. President, we've been hearing a lot about your position on abortion this week because of Mr. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. Are you planning any initiatives from the White House related to abortion? Or are you going to wait and see what the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> does, number one? And, number two, as a person who's always, from what we know, had the financial and emotional resources to know that you could raise your children comfortably, do you feel any awkwardness about telling other people, whose situations you do n't know, how they should run their lives? A. Not when it comes to the question of life. I do feel an awkwardness in terms of having been able to take care of my kids when they were sick or raise them properly or something like that; I feel a certain privilege. I feel a certain _ very fortunate in that regard. And I know a lot of people are n't. But, in some _ on this issue, I think we're talking here of principle and I sure would like to put the emphasis on adoption. And that means a broader acceptance of that principle. Q. Are you going to have any White House initiatives or are you going to wait for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>? A. Oh, wait for _ I think probably wait, but I have been pledged, as you know, to an amendment. But, I'd like to see the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision as soon as possible. Q. Mr. President _ A. One, two, three _ Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio report this morning seems to indicate that they are rejecting your statement of a week ago today that good will would beget good will. While you did n't specifically mention <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by name in your speech, what would your message to them be on relations, and what would your message be to them about helping get the hostages out? A. Well, I would make a broad appeal, transcending <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, to anybody that can be helpful to get the hostages out. Perhaps _ I have n't seen the wire copy, but perhaps they are _ if there is such a story by them, maybe they're saying, `` Look, we're not holding your hostages. And I'd have to say, `` Well, from our intelligence, our information, that's probably correct _ probably correct.'' In terms of the future, there was a period of time when we had excellent relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. And I do n't want to _ want to think that the status quo has to go on forever. But I do think that the renunciation of terror in any form, and a facilitating to the degree they can the release of the hostages, would be a couple of good steps they could take.

 Q. May I follow up, Mr. President? Follow up on that? Q. Mr. President _ A. No, you do n't get to follow his question! -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> _ and then here. Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, reaching out _ Q. You've _ you've spoken frequently about reaching out to blacks, that you want that to be an important goal of your administration. This week, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> issued a decision that may kill many of the minority set-aside programs that have been so helpful to blacks across this country. Does that concern you? Are you worried about these programs? A. I _ it did n't kill all set-asides, and it did n't kill off affirmative action. I have been committed to affirmative action. I want to see a reinvigorated Office of Minority Business and Commerce. I want to see our SBA program go forward vigorously. And so, I would say that that decision spoke to one set of facts, in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> I believe it was. And _ but do n't read in _ I will not read into that a mandate, to me, to stop trying on _ on equal _ equal employment, and on affirmative action generally. Yes? Q. You said during the campaign, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, that you would roll back taxes on capital gains if elected. Now, as you begin to look at the budget numbers, is that going to be a promise you can keep when you make your submission to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, or is that no longer affordable? A. I hope it _ affordable! It gains you revenue. And we've got a big argument with some people about that, they do n't want to go back and look at what happened in 1978 _ it gains revenue. Now I know we've got all kinds of bureaucracies around here that do n't agree with that. But that was discussed in the campaign. I'm convinced it will bring in additional revenue and, in the process, create additional jobs for men and women. So I would like to see it a fundamental part of whatever we do. Now, if your question is: can I get it done? _ that's something else again. But I want to see it done. We _ there was an issue in that campaign where there was a clear difference; that was one where there was a clear difference. The opposition was saying: My opponent is proposing something that will cost the taxpayer $ 30 billion. And I'm saying it will create jobs. And, indeed, I've seen estimates by intelligent people thinking it will bring in revenues in excess of $ 4 billion. And so I'm going to keep pushing that because I know it's right, and I ran on it. Yeah, <PERSON> Robby </PERSON>? Q. Mr. President, once more on the pay raise. You've portrayed yourself as a late-comer on the issue who has no real power to affect it. But, a point of fact, I believe that you do have the power, if you want to, to limit the pay raises that would otherwise automatically go to your own staff. Will you do that, number one; and number two, do you think both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ought to vote on it? A. Well, I think in a _ I think in the best of all worlds _ Wait till I get _ wait till I _ Q. It's a trick question, sir. -LRB- Laughter -RRB- A. -LRB- Laughs -RRB- He's a fair-minded guy! -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- No, I _ I think our _ our _ our chief of staff has tried to hold the line on increases in hiring people. And I think you're all aware of that. And I think he's done a very good job on it. I do n't know how the law affects the staff in terms of automatic _ automatic increases. But there's a nice little problem that if you do go forward with automatic increases, is there any money? That has to be appropriated in some way. So we'll have to talk about what we'll do. What was the other part of it?

In a _ in a _ in a perfect world, in a world where you were starting over, yes, I'd have to say I do. But that is n't the proposal that's up there. And it's all or nothing.

Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, a few minutes ago, on the answer concerning the hostages, you indicated that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was probably not holding the hostages. Did you mean to say that we believe that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> exercises no control over the people who are holding the hostages? A. No. I mean to say, they are not holding the hostages. Do they have any control? We can get varying degrees of intelligence on that, various assessments as to how much control they have over <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> or these families or whoever it is. And also, you've got different _ different groups involved in the holding of these hostages. But, what I _ no, I'm glad to get a chance to clarify it, because unless the information I have is wrong, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> itself, the government, is not actually holding these _ holding these people. And if they were, you know, I would just reiterate my view that the way to improve relations is to let them go, give these people their freedom _ they did n't do anything wrong. Q. And a follow-up, Mr. President. Do we believe that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> can exercise influence to gain the hostages' release? A. I think they can have influence. Yes, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>? Q. You inherited a budget from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that calls for something like a 2 percent real increase in defense spending. In the campaign, you seemed to think that maybe zero real growth in defense spending would be adequate. Given the deficit pressures, do you think there is some room for reduction in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> defense budget to fund some of the other programs, like the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L problem that you've got to worry about A. We are wrestling with that problem right now. I'm committed to a strong defense. I did say certain things in the campaign that fit into our flexible freeze concept. And so, we will _ I will have to address that with some detail on Feb. 9, and I will. We have time for just a couple of more. Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, in the back _ A. This is 36 minutes here. Q. Mr. President, you said the other day that _ Q. Just say `` no.'' Q. _ education was the main way for dealing with drugs. A. Yes. Q. Is n't that a backing away from your commitment on drugs? Certainly, there are other things than education to deal with the problem. A. Absolutely. And I was surprised when I read that some interpreted what I said as _ for suggesting that interdiction is not important, or cooperation with foreign governments in terms of eradication at the source is not important. They are very important! My point is, we are not going to solve the problem of drug use in this country through interdiction alone, through cutting off the supply alone. And a larger component of the solution lies in education and on _ and in that whole demand side of the equation, law enforcement at home, these things. Last one, here. Q. -LRB- Inaudible -RRB-. A. Look, this is a follow-up.

 Q. Mr. President, how much money are you going to spend on drugs? If it's the major problem that you say it is, certainly education just one very small part of it? A. It's not a small part, it's a tremendous part. And the federal government can spend some on it and the private sector has got to spend enormous amounts. The media has done a good job in terms of pro bono advertising. And that's got to be enormously stepped up. So it _ look, it has got to be a tremendous increase, not only on the money, but the emphasis on the educational side.

You will see me side by side with <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> on _ in putting the proper emphasis from the Oval Office on my determination to do everything in the government's power, federal government's power, to eliminate this scourge. Last one! <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>? Q. Is there any _ Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, you and your aides have talked about the need for a fast start, and you've talked all week about ethics and about bipartisanship. And yet, the week has been marked by unexpected controversies over Dr. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s views on abortion and then the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L issue, which is sort of a self-inflicted wound. Are you finding it harder to control an agenda here than you thought you might? A. No, no. I'm just getting a preview of coming attractions and it's been lovely. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- And it's going to change and I know it. But, no, I think it's been a wonderfully harmonious week, and these are just little ripples on the surface of an otherwise calm pond. Q. You're not concerned that if you just talk about things that _ I mean, everyone approves of ethics, just about everyone approves of bipartisanship, is n't there a danger of people saying that, you know, there's not much meat behind the words? A. There's a danger of that, yeah, but people are _ realize that you've been here four days of this week, or five, this is the fifth day, in office after the weekend, and they understand that in things like the foreign policy area, that it's prudent to have a review; they understand that we've got to get our people in place. And so I _ there's some danger, I guess, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>, but I would n't say an overwhelming danger. I mean, we just go for it. If we just sat around and did nothing except be pleasant to people on the hill or something, why, I could expect that would grow a little old for you all. But, we're going to _ we're going to _ I think we did _ we've set a certain tone and a certain outreach, and then go forward when _ as soon as these specific proposals start up there, whether it's on education or anti-narcotics or on foreign policy or on some bilateral foreign visitor coming in, there will be plenty of _ plenty of time for controversy and plenty of time for lively debate on substance. But I would simply say that will follow and follow pretty soon. Thank you all very much. The press: Thank you.

 Here at a glance are highlights from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first formal news conference Friday:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>S&amp;L PROBLEMS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was not disturbed by the flap in response to reports that he was considering a fee that would be charged to <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L depositors to raise money for government efforts to deal with failed institutions. `` It does n't bother me for a lot of ideas to be considered and debated. ... I have not made decisions on this one. I'll wait till I get all the facts, call them as I see them, and hope that we can convince the American people that that's the way to go.'' He added: `` I will say this, that the savings and loans' deposits are backed by the full faith and credit of the government And they are sound. They are good _ dollar good. And I just want to assure the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people of that. And nothing is going to change in that regard.''
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>CONGRESSIONAL PAY RAISE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of the Reagan-proposed $ 45,000 pay raise for judges, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and other high-ranking government officials: `` I do support it. A raise is overdue, there's no question about that.'' He added, `` I am troubled by certain aspects of the proposal ... but we're down to the crunch here. The recommendation's up there on the <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> _ it's either yea or nay. ... Seeing the problems as I do, I still feel I should not go about undoing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> decision.''
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>TRIP TO CHINA</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Asked about visiting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> before responding to Soviet Leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s request for an early meeting, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` I do n't know what signal it sends in that regard, but let me just remind you that I'm the one who does not believe in, quote, ` playing the Soviet card' or, quote, ` playing the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> card.' ... It just seemed like an appropriate visit, but not to signal a playing of the card to go one up on Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. There's nothing of that nature in this visit. ... The visit stands on its own and does not have any signaling that should be detrimental to anybody else's interest.''
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>MINIMUM WAGE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated his position that any increase in the minimum wage should be `` linked to a training wage, to a differential of sorts, so that you do n't throw people out of work by raising the minimum wage. And I'm not one who has felt that the minimum wage is the key to economic prosperity for the lowest _ people on the lowest end of the economic spectrum. But, as I indicated, a certain flexibility on that question. And again, I'll wait for -LRB- Labor Secretary -RRB- <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who takes office in the next couple of days, to come in with her recommendations.''
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>THE PLO</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said meetings would be held with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` as long as they stay hooked and stay committed'' to accepting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, renouncing terrorism and accepting two <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions affirming the right of all Middle Eastern states to live within secure borders. `` If there's some logical step that requires high-level sign-off by various participants over there, then, and then only, would it be proper to elevate the meetings to that level. We're just starting. You crawl before you walk. We're just starting to talk to them, because they have _ dramatically, I'd say _ agreed to the, to the principles that are part of our policy.''

<HEAD>Vietnam Might Open Cam Ranh Bay, Senator Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is thinking of opening the sprawling Soviet-operated military port of <LOCATION> Cam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> to all countries including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, says a senator in contact with <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> diplomats. Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, also told reporters after meeting <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador that the envoy was `` very positive'' about the idea of establishing an unofficial <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presence in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> for humanitarian purposes, primarily help for Amerasian children whose mothers were Vietnamese and fathers were <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen during the Vietnam War. <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, who plans another in a series of visits to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in March, talked to reporters Friday after meeting on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Trinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Xuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> was the first <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for official meetings since the northern half of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> became independent from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1954. `` I asked about the Soviet presence at <LOCATION> Cam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON> said, referring to the giant port built by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the Vietnam War and now the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s largest overseas military base. `` I was very pleased at the response that there is consideration given to opening that port up to all the countries of the world,'' he said. `` I said sure, you'd find the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> interested in occasionally calling in there.'' Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last September offered to dismantle the base at <LOCATION> Cam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in exchange for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> giving up its key bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reacted coolly and later agreed on terms with the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for continued use of its installations until 1991. Ambassador <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, at a meeting with State and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> officials, promised that <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> would continue to cooperate with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to account for about 1,700 American servicemen still missing in the Indochina War, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The department relaxed rules restricting the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area to enable him to attend a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reception and used his presence to stress <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern about the POW-MIA issue. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> reiterated that normalization of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> depends on complete withdrawal of Vietnamese military forces from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> said later he was `` very satisfied'' with his meetings, which he said aimed `` at better understanding and reconciliation.'' U.S.-Vietnam relations `` sooner or later'' will be normalized, he told reporters on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts in the meantime to complete the complicated finding and processing for entry to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of thousands of people enduring hardship in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> today because they had American fathers or American connections during the war, and their families. <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON> said the ambassador told him <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> was agreeable to allowing representatives of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> private voluntary organizations to establish a `` humanitarian presence'' for such purposes in <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>, since renamed <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The senator estimated 12,000 Amerasian children of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> fathers, now young adults, remain in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and that with family members a total of up to 36,000 people could be involved. Estimates of the number of Vietnamese marked as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sympathizers and subjected after the war to detention and `` re-education'' vary widely and have run as high as 500,000.

 Two aging Nazi war criminals pardoned by the Dutch parliament arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after spending 43 years in prison for sending thousands of Dutch Jews to death camps, among them possibly <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. West German President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> praised the <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> decision Friday to pardon the two war criminals, calling it a humanitarian act. A government spokesman said the men would be allowed to settle in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The Dutch decision to pardon and expel <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, 87, and <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> aus </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuenten </PERSON>, 79, ended two days of emotional debate. Opponents of the pardon said the men should have remained in jail the rest of their lives. Rabbi <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hier </PERSON>, head of the Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, wrote in a letter to Dutch Premier <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON>, `` It is unconscionable to release such notorious individuals who perpetrated heinous crimes and caused suffering to so many thousands.'' <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Soetendorp </PERSON>, a prominent Dutch rabbi, added, `` We saw this coming, but still it hit us very hard.'' <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> headed a local branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and was held responsible for deporting 13,000 Jews to death camps. Aus der <PERSON> Fuenten </PERSON> was an SS administrator who oversaw mass roundups of Jews in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Soetendorp </PERSON> said aus <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuenten </PERSON> `` may have been indirectly responsible'' for sending <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> to a concentration camp. The girl and her family lived in an <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> attic for two years before they were discovered and sent to concentration camps. Her poignant work, `` The Diary of <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>,'' perhaps the most famous personal document to come out of the Holocaust, was published in 1947 and was turned into a play and movie. She died of pneumonia in 1945 at age 15 in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bergen-Belsen </LOCATION> concentration camp. A brief film clip on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television network showed the two frail-looking, grey-haired men step out of an ambulance. ARD did not say where the two men crossed the border into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> late Friday and gave no other details. West German border police referred all questions to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, but ministry spokesmen could not be reached late Friday. Aus der <PERSON> Fuenten </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, lives in an apartment in a working-class neighborhood in <LOCATION> Duisburg </LOCATION>, 36 miles from the Dutch border. All the shutters were down and no one appeared to be in the apartment late Friday. Some residents on the street reacted with anger and disbelief to the news that aus <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuenten </PERSON> had been released. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Dehnen </PERSON>, who lives across the street from aus der <PERSON> Fuenten </PERSON>'s wife, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` I ca n't help but think of the victims' families and the pain this man caused. <PERSON> Ute </PERSON> <PERSON> Dehnen </PERSON>, his wife, said: `` I've never spoken to her as a matter of principle. I would have divorced that man and I ca n't understand why any woman would n't. Another neighbor, who asked not to be identified, said: `` This is a quiet, decent street and we do n't need people like him -LRB- aus der Fuenten -RRB- here. For me he is still a mass murderer. They should n't have set him free. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> and aus der Fuenten were imprisoned for their roles in the deaths of thousands of Dutch Jews during World War II. They were sentenced to death in 1950, but a year later their sentences were commuted to life in prison. Dutch Justice Minister <PERSON> Frits </PERSON> <PERSON> Korthals </PERSON> <PERSON> Altes </PERSON> said keeping the two in jail any longer would violate the rule of law because the nation has pardoned 106 other war criminals who had originally been sentenced to death. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> and aus der Fuenten were the sole surviving exceptions, he said. Only two major Nazi war criminals are held by authorities in foreign countries _ <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON>, called the `` Butcher of <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>,'' is serving a life sentence in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for war crimes committed in that country. <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON>, who prosecutors say was responsible for the deaths of thousands of people, has been jailed more than a year in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> after he was captured outside a German-Argentine village. He is awaiting extradition to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. One of the most notorious Nazi war criminals, <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON>, is reportedly living in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON>, a close associate of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON>, has been held responsible for the wartime murder of 100,000 Jews.

 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is so close to building a nuclear bomb that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> probably wo n't be able to certify this year that the country does n't have one, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration reportedly told members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before the former president left office. That certification is necessary if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is to receive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and military aid beyond the current fiscal year. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had requested $ 621 million in aid to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> for fiscal 1990, as part of a $ 4.02 billion, six-year package. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> today quoted congressional sources as saying they were told by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was so close to building a bomb that `` it had been a very close call'' when the administration in November renewed the certification that the country does not have a nuclear bomb. The newspaper said that when the certification was renewed, a letter was attached to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, saying the administration was nearing its limits of being able to continue making the certification. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should be aware that as <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s capabilities grow, and if evidence about its activities continue to accumulate, this process of annual certification will require the president to reach judgments about the status of <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> nuclear activities that may be difficult or impossible to make with any degree of certainty,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying. Without certification, required annually under the law, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will not be eligible to receive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and military aid beyond the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. The newspaper said it was not known if President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will accept his predecessor's conclusion about <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s nuclear capabilities, although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is known to be extremely concerned about the problem of nuclear weapons proliferation. In his letter to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he had made his `` best judgment'' on the basis of available information to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, based on the standard set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> regarding the Pakistani nuclear program. The standard, he said, `` is whether <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> possesses a nuclear explosive device, not whether <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is attempting to develop or has developed various relevant capacities.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in the letter that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remained `` extremely troubled'' by the continuing risk of a nuclear arms race between <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said.

I should have done it years ago. I regret having ever taken it,'' she said. The woman, identified by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transporation </ORGANIZATION> only as <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, took the sign in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> in 1977. The sign is worth about $ 42. Return postage cost the woman $ 7.12. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, said he appreciated the woman's decision. `` You asked if there were anything else you could do. You have done enough and much more than most people,'' <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> replied in a letter to the woman.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> next month as an old friend of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top leaders who has helped the nations weather some of their stormiest relations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for two days after the Feb. 24 funeral in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, in announcing the trip Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s close ties with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were an element in the decision to visit <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> just one month after taking office. `` Undoubtedly there are some personal issues involved there in terms of his relations with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will show support for <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s economic reforms. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has known <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader, since he headed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1974-75. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> at the time was vice premier but was soon to be purged by leftists in the dying days of the disastrous 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was firmly in control when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a candidate for vice president, returned in 1980, a year after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> established diplomatic relations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said, was a `` lao pengyou,'' an `` old friend'' of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people. But his welcome was less than cordial. The Chinese were outraged by statements by candidate <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that his administration might restore official ties with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was delegated to convince the Chinese that there would be no backsliding in U.S.-Chinese relations. `` Since we are old friends we must be very frank,'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> later said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had `` failed to reassure <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> over recent statements by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' But the visit also had its warmer moments. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, went shopping for teacups at the Friendship Store, the special store for foreigners, and walked over to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. There, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> renewed acquaintances with the barber, the manager and the tennis court attendants he had known in 1974-75. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned as vice president in May 1982, and told then-premier and current <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, `` We feel at home in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. During our stay here we spent a great deal of time on our bicycles touring the city. ... Those were happy days. Those were good days, important days.'' That visit, however, also was dominated by the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> question. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> spoke of the `` dark clouds'' of bilateral relations caused by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s mission was to defuse <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s demand for a final date by which all arms sales to the rival Nationalists on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> would cease. At the beginning of his official talks with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked for a five-minute private meeting. Instead, the two spent two hours together and emerged to tell waiting aides that there was no need for further discussions. Three months later the sides signed a communique in which <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> agreed to gradually reduce arms sales to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s last visit in 1985 was decidedly more relaxed. He spoke to students in <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION>, took a boat ride down the scenic <LOCATION> Li </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Guilin </LOCATION> and toured the prosperous southern cities of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shenzhen </LOCATION>. He also played tennis with then-Vice Premier <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON>. `` I like what I see,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>. `` We still have fundamental differences, systematic differences with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. But we're finding more and more things in common.'' Chinese leaders, in a nation where personal ties often outweigh ideological concerns, unabashedly favored <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the presidential election and believe that the new administration will have better understanding of and sympathy for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> because of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s many contacts here. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, in a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> in September, startled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials by saying he hoped <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s `` old friend'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would win the election.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As the Soviets head home, a faint wind of change is stirring at <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, cradle of the Afghan intelligentsia whose Marxist revolution this impoverished Moslem country has rejected. At the semester that started last fall, a majority of academic staff voted for the science and agriculture faculties to scrap courses in Marxist-style ideology that have been compulsory for all the 7,000 students since the 1978 revolution. Hard-line members of the governing <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> still hold key academic positions at the university, which numbers among its graduates of the early 1970s Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, a physician, and a dozen of his top political associates. But for the first time since the revolution, deans who are not party members _ five out of 13, according to the new engineering dean _ were appointed last fall. Also, the U.S.-sponsored faculty of engineering is to reopen in March at the end of the current extended winter vacation. It was closed after Soviet troops arrived in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to try to quell the rebellion. In a desolate building which houses the faculty, the laboratories are stripped of most equipment and text books are more than a decade out of date. The most talented lecturers long ago went into exile. At the entrance, two holes in plaster remain where revolutionaries ripped down a plaque stating the faculty was a gift from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. For five years until 1963, the faculty was linked to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> and then sponsored jointly by 11 American universities and technology institutes. `` Because the Soviet presence was so strong here, they -LRB- the Afghan regime -RRB- wanted to pretend to them that anything that was not Soviet-related was bad,'' said <PERSON> Ata </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazar </PERSON>, the new dean of the faculty. <PERSON> Nazar </PERSON>, 45, has a master's degree and doctorate in civil engineering from <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and earns the equivalent of $ 250 a month. Huddled over a single heater in a bone-chilling office, <PERSON> Nazar </PERSON> nurtures a folorn hope: that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> universities will resume support of the faculty even though <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> remains shakily in power as the Soviets depart. The Soviets are due to leave by Feb. 15 under a U.N.-mandated agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. But there is no sign of peace, with Moslem rebels still fighting <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s regime. Western countries are withholding aid and refuse to deal with a regime they believe will fall after its Soviet protectors depart. The engineering faculty, the only one that taught in English before the revolution, plans to resume teaching in English. With educational standards plummeting through years of war and <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> more widely taught than English, <PERSON> Nazar </PERSON> faces a tough task. He complained that Western countries, which cut ties with the university in 1978, now punish the wrong people. `` We feel isolated,'' he said. `` The Russians say they made a mistake coming here, so why should we take the blame?'' `` To remove this government and install another: is it worth it? They will defend themselves. How many more Afghans should die?'' he added. In a nearby administrative building, Dr. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamrani </PERSON>, 35, a founding party member who has the title of vice chancellor for social and cultural affairs at the university, has a blunt answer. `` It may take millions of lives,'' he said of the conflict in which about 1 million people already have died. `` But I am certain we will not collapse ... The system will survive.'' He said the scaling down of political courses as more of an administrative arrangement to accommodate extra numbers of non-science students in the programs. <PERSON> Khamrani </PERSON>, a neurologist who graduated a few years behind <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, spoke with scarcely concealed impatience of `` barefoot peasants'' steeped in Islam, whom the revolution was to liberate. The West `` rudely interfered in our affairs,'' he charged. But <PERSON> Khamrani </PERSON> added that he and his fellow revolutionaries made some mistakes too, trying to change things too fast in a `` feudal, agrarian and backward society.'' Despite rebels operating within a few miles of the city and the Soviets on their way out, he appeared not to contemplate possible death or jail for being a high profile party member. `` The Soviets will help us,'' he said from his seat beneath a portrait of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. `` They wo n't leave us alone.''

 <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> has trouble sleeping at night. He dreams he is back in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> more than 20 years ago going down a dark river on a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> patrol boat trying to ambush Viet Cong soldiers. He is 19 years old and scared, having been wounded once already. Startled, he awakens in his bedroom in <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, now 40, and seven other veterans from the <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> area are returning to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to revisit their bases and relive their war days of two decades ago as treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, which includes sleeplessness and restlessness `` I want to come to peace with my mind, the country and the people and put all that behind me because the war's over,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said Friday during a stopover in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> en route to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> on the first leg of the group's two-week tour. `` I want to get on with a lot of things in my life.'' Another veteran, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, 39, a Marine who helped build <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fire bases, wants to rid himself of guilt. `` There's apologies I feel I need to make to the people,'' said <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>. `` There were civilians who were caught in our fire, and I've had guilt feelings about that. The other thing is to try to leave the warrior part of me in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> where it belongs. It does n't fit in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Accompanying the veterans are two therapists, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Scurfield </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran himself, and April Gerlock, and a film crew that will make a documentary that could be used in therapy for other veterans. The veterans will undergo therapy during the trip and for two months after they return home. They had been required to attend group therapy sessions once a week for the last five months in preparation for their return to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` Basically we're utilizing sort of an extension of a very accepted therapeutic practice in working with trauma survivors,'' said <PERSON> Scurfield </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> PTSD </ORGANIZATION> program at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>. `` That is direct therapeutic exposure to the trauma.'' `` By coming over here, our assumption is it will trigger repressed memories and feelings that they they need to get out consciously and talk about,'' he said. `` In doing that it appears they come to some kind of a peace.'' <PERSON> Scurfield </PERSON> said many veterans picture <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> today as it was 20 years ago. `` By going now,'' he said, `` they have to substitute the reality of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> today. It's not the way it was 20 years ago. That's a very important message for many veterans.'' The veterans will see a new landscape devoid of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> artillery and air bases, covered over by red dirt, with few reminders of the more than half a million American troops who served there.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> asserted his authority to compel testimony from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and plans to rule Monday on whether to throw out subpoenas for the two in the trial of fired White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. The trial of North in the Iran-Contra case was still scheduled to begin Tuesday after an interagency task force of intelligence experts concluded that classified documents to be presented in the case do n't pose a serious national security risk. `` I guess we're ready to go,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> told lawyers for both sides Friday. `` I'll see all of you at 9:30 Tuesday morning.'' At a hearing, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said that judicial authority to force <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to testify is `` indisputable.'' `` As far as the power of the court to require testimony'' of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is concerned, `` I do not think there is any question,'' he said. `` The court has the power.'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Saltzberg </PERSON> said that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s subpoenas should be quashed because the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide had not specified how <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s testimony would be relevant at trial <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he envisioned having the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> subpoena remain in force, with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` on call'' but under no obligation to appear immediately, and the government would be heard again before any order for him to appear. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simms </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s lawyers, was in the courtroom for the hearing. Former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> is the lead attorney representing the former president. North also is seeking presidential documents, including <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s diary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, the lawyer who will prosecute <PERSON> North </PERSON>, said that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel a year ago had prepared typed excerpts from the diary. Lawyers from the office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, for whom <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> works, reviewed the excerpts, but did not get copies of them, said <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> delayed a ruling on the documents subpoena. <PERSON> Saltzberg </PERSON> is to contact <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s lawyers and make arrangements to have those diary segments made available to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers as well. Meanwhile, an administration official said secrecy concerns would not block <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial. The interagency group of intelligence experts had identified some documents that might pose problems if <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> allowed their disclosure in open court by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers. However, much would depend on <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s rulings from the bench during the trial on the relevancy and admissibility of the documents, said the administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. And he said government secrecy experts familiar with the documents did not expect the sensitive material to be admitted because it did n't appear relevant to the case. The official said administration officials planned to monitor the trial closely in the event there was an attempt by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers to introduce into evidence documents that would compromise national security. Another government source close to the matter, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said that one agency he declined to identify had problems with some of the classified information in the case, but that the other agencies represented on the intelligence task force had refused to go along with the objections. North is accused of concealing from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and from former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> his efforts on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras and of covering up the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>'s role in diverting money from the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales to the Contras. North also is accused of illegally accepting a $ 13,800 security system at his home from co-defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, converting to his own use at least $ 4,300 in traveler's checks from <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> of tax revenue in connection with charitable contributions supporting the Contras.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There's good news for women rich enough to afford the haute couture clothes shown by 20 high fashion designers in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> this week. After a few seasons of extravagance, the look is pretty and wearable. The mood was strictly feminine in showings dominated by tender, wispy chiffons and silks, bias cuts, body-hugging sheaths and bustiers, oversized pants and plenty of pleats. Evening wear was regal with generous use of embroidery, lace and jewels, and gold and silver applique. It was adieu to oversized shoulders, mini-skirts and party poufs. The lines are fluid and graceful, with fluttering chiffons and soft crepes seen for both daytime and evening wear. Hems, for the most part, skimmed the knee, although <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION> opted for the midcalf length worn under long tunic jackets reminiscent of the 1930s. Dresses cost anywhere from $ 10,000 and up, and set trends for the fashion industry worldwide. For some designers, like <ORGANIZATION> Givenchy </ORGANIZATION>, it was the year of the dress. But pants lovers will find some in almost every collection. <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint-Laurent </PERSON>'s showed plenty of his signature trousers cut to perfection, stopping above the ankle, and Per Spook excelled at easy-to-wear pajamas pants that covered the shoe. For the cocktail hour, look for <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON>'s simple black sheath that plunges to the waist in the back and circled by gentle white-tipped ruffling. <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> was this year's winner of the Golden Thimble award for the most beautiful collection, and he earned it with classy designs in colors that exploded on the runway: sunbursts of yellow, juicy reds and bright oranges melting into gentle pastels in the palest of blue, green and pink. <PERSON> Saint-Laurent </PERSON>, too, did wonders with the basics, slitting skirts from hem to waist and revealing lots of leg. Suit jackets necklines dipped dramatically and his ultra-sheer chiffon blouses worn with skirts bared all. Italian fashion king <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> made his debut in the world of French haute couture, ruffling feathers in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Things only got worse when his business partner, <PERSON> Giancarlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Giametti </PERSON>, defended the decision saying <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> could n't afford to show for `` down-and-out women and second-rate actresses.'' <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> showed the same clothes as he did in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, and they were a hit with the French couture crowd. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> abandoned the extravagance of his previous collections and came up with feminine design in clouds of pastel. He draped reams of chiffon in flowing pant-skirts, embroidered and bejeweled raw silk. He used lace relentlessly and gathered organza into sumptuous mountains. <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON>'s palette was full of sandy beiges recalling desert exoticism _ a replacement of his previous Provencal look _ mixing melon and pistachio pastels, poppy reds, Persian blue, black, white and navy. Unlike <PERSON> Givenchy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> and <PERSON> Saint-Laurent </PERSON> who played up the waist with drapery, belts and buttons galore, <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> minimized it with trapezium and triangular shapes. <PERSON> Torrente </PERSON> maintained Parisian chic by day with polka dot pastel dresses, kick pleats sometimes topped with a bow or tiered dresses, and always, wide-brimmed hats. For after-dark, there were draped chiffon and crepe, held at the shoulder or waist with jewels or a bow. <PERSON> Hanae </PERSON> <PERSON> Mori </PERSON> was another toast to femininity. Her floor-length yellow draped sheath was set off by a line of ruffles running from shoulder to toe. For evening wear, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dior </PERSON> went to the sari, using feathery light fabrics like crepe georgette or shantung silk crepe in a diagonal movement from waist to the opposite shoulder, and Indian style, around the back to the hand. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON> made the mini even smaller than before, then covered it up, almost. <PERSON> Nini </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricci </PERSON>, not known as a trend-setter, produced a large collection of simple but beautiful clothes for all times of day. There were wide, soft pants, pleated and swirling skirts and cinched waists creating a kind of nostalgic girlish prettiness. <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherrer </PERSON> revelled in pants, dressing them down for day or up for night with lace and embroidery. For lovers of long skirts, there's perfection in <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION>'s pretty schoolgirl look, particulary good for daytime in navy and cream. The new <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION> jacket is longer and collarless, fastening with a single button just above the waist. Watch for the newest <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION> buttons in pearl, and the silky smooth leather purse _ the latest in <LOCATION> Chanel </LOCATION> chic.

<HEAD>Vets Group Asks Pentagon to Declassify Records on MIAs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Pentagon says no purpose would be served by declassifying files on Americans missing in action in the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war, as a veterans' advocacy group is seeking. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION>, chaired by <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kinston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said in a letter to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` Use your powers as president to help us liberate the truth. ... Mr. President, you can not just wish that the issues of the Vietnam War will go away.'' <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON> said the request to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was partly a response to a report from the State and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> departments just before the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration left office that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agencies `` have yet to find conclusive evidence of the existence of live prisoners.'' But Army Lt. Col. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, chief <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman on issues affecting the missing, said in response to <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON>'s request, `` I do n't feel a proposal like you're talking about will do anything to enhance these ongoing efforts'' for `` the fullest accounting'' of what happened to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen. `` It's quite obvious'' that declassification would jeopardize intelligence sources and collection techniques, <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said, and `` your sources quickly begin to disappear'' when that happens. Information bearing on individuals in the files has been shared with families without revealing sources and techniques, he said. Meanwhile, in another development, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canterbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, speaking for the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said a delegation from that group would meet North Korean officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> seeking an invitation to visit <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for discussions on returning the remains of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers killed there. The Pentagon still lists 2,383 Americans as missing or unaccounted for in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> or nearby waters. <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> said remains of `` probably several hundred'' Americans were in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> as a result of the 1950-1953 Korean War. On Monday, the Vietnamese government turned over remains believed to be those of 23 Americans killed there. <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON> said his group's letter was in response to the president's inaugural address and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s references to a `` new breeze blowing.'' <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON>'s group has long maintained that Americans are in captivity in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Last fall, it sponsored an incursion into <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> by two Americans, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, to spread word of a $ 2.4 million reward being offered by 21 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for anyone who freed an American. The two were caught on their first day and held for 41 days before being released.

 Labor unions represented a slightly smaller share of the nation's work force in 1988 even though the total number of union members increased, the government reports. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that the number of Americans belonging to labor unions rose by 100,000 to 17 million last year, but the size of the overall work force increased even faster. Union members continued last year to earn more than non-union workers. Full-time workers who were union members had median weekly earnings of $ 480 compared with $ 356 for those who were not union members, the department reported. The department said 16.8 percent of the 101 million wage and salary employees in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year were union members, down from 17 percent in 1987 and 18 percent in 1985. The 100,000 new union members came from the ranks of black workers, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. In fact, there were slight decreases in the number of whites and Hispanics belonging to unions last year. Membership among black workers rose from 2.44 million in 1987 to 2.55 million last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The membership gain, although slight, provided some solace to union officials who have dedicated many of their efforts in recent years to trying to reverse declining membership. `` We hope we have bottomed out, but we do n't know yet for sure,'' said <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardesty </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. There were 10.7 union members in private industry last year and 6.3 million government workers in unions.

<HEAD>Opposition Proposes Referendum On Constitutional Reforms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An opposition coalition has proposed elections for Nicaraguans to decide if they want major constitutional reforms, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> reported. The opposition newspaper said the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Huembes </PERSON>, signed the proposal, which was sent to President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Friday. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> said constitutional reforms sought by the opposition group included free elections, democratic reforms and amnesty for political prisoners. The referendum would ask `` if the government should ... accept the constitutional reforms, considering the urgency of the circumstances.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> is scheduled to make `` transcendent announcements'' about the country's economic policies today when he meets with leaders of union, peasant and professional groups that support the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government, pro-government news media reported. Economic conditions in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> are deteriorating and shortages of food and basic commodities are common. The leftist Sandinista government and the opposition deadlocked a year ago on discussions of such proposed constitutional reforms. `` We hope that the government ... will see it is obligated to soon make announcements about the policies that affect the social base of all Nicaraguans,'' <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> quoted the letter as saying. The opposition group is formed by five opposition political parties, two unions and a group of professionals. The opposition group said it hoped that a peace summit of Central American presidents, canceled earlier this month, will be rescheduled for Feb. 13-14. The summit was canceled after Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> asked for more time for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to formulate his policy in the region. Although various proposals have been made, no new date has been set. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> were to resume stalled talks on a stalled Central American peace plan. The August 1987 plan that <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> designed calls for an end to civil wars in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, political amensties and democratic guarantees in the five Central American nations. The Sandinista government and U.S.-backed anti-communist rebels agreed in March 1988 to suspend offensive operations, but talks aimed at a permanent end to the 7-year war are at an impasse.

 An entrepreneur is dedicated to doing for toilet stalls what <PERSON> Muzak </PERSON> has done to elevators _ invade the senses of those with time on their hands. `` Everyone reads in the bathroom,'' says <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Rons </PERSON>, a 26-year-old from suburban <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION> who believes the walls of stalls can be used to promote everything from pantyhose to taxis. His company, <ORGANIZATION> In-Stall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, has lined up space in the restrooms of a theater, a tavern, restaurants, and three tour-bus companies, he said. The businesses will recieve a cut of Rons' revenues for installing up to 10 framed, 6-by-6-inch ads on the back of each stall door. Advertisers will pay about $ 180 per month for a five-stall display, with a captive audience guaranteed. <PERSON> Rons </PERSON> said the ploy enables advertisers to target just one gender by advertising in one bathroom. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Hick </PERSON>, who manages the Celebrity Theater, said the pitch made sense. `` The way he presented it, it's going to be very tastefully done and very professionally done,'' she said. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Nomikos </PERSON>, who runs Hightops, a <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION> sports bar, disagreed. `` We're not going to take it,'' he said. `` It kind of looks tacky in the bathroom, I think, to put advertising in the toilets.'' <PERSON> Rons </PERSON>, who studied architectural design, said he and a friend came up with the idea watching a television program on different advertising mediums.

<HEAD>At 75 Below, Even Alaskans Think It's Cold</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 It was too cold for driving, too cold for flying, too cold for just about everything. It was so cold, with wind chill readings of up to 115 degrees below zero, that even dog sled races were canceled. And that is n't just an Alaskan tall tale. In an arctic state where people take cold weather for granted, where subzero temperatures are about as common as frost in the lower 48, a sudden plunge into brutally bitter cold has grabbed everyone's attention It was 75 degrees below zero Friday in <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, about 150 miles west of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McKinley </LOCATION>. It was 43 below in Fairbanks, where electricity demand hit an all-time high. Far to the south in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, the state's largest city, the high Friday was 15 below. `` We're not declaring an emergency yet,'' Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said with a stiff upper lip as Alaskans wondered whether the temperatures would break the record of 80 below zero set in 1971 at <LOCATION> Prospect </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. However, in a brief radio message, the governor gave instructions on how to call for emergency help. And, he acknowledged, `` There's no end in sight, apparently. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> held out a bit more hope, saying temperatures could rise by the middle of next week. Forecasters said they did n't know whether the cold air would have an effect on temperatures elsewhere in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The cold snap, carrying wind chills of up to 115 below, is being caused by the southerly flow of the jet stream, which ordinarily carries storms that bring relatively warm air into <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, the forecasters said. By contrast, it remained unusually warm through the middle and eastern sections of the nation Friday, with highs soaring into the 60s as far north as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Records were set in many cities, including <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, with a high of 63, and <LOCATION> Apalachicola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, where it was 77. The Alaskan cold forced school closures in some towns, and people in some <LOCATION> Kodiac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> communities replenished their household heating fuel with supplies from well-stocked schools. In a state that relies heavily on air travel because of its size, the cold forced the cancellation of some flights. Some rural grocery stores reported dwindling supplies. The adjutant general of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>, said the guard would have difficulty making emergency assistance flights because of the cold. However, he said planes might be able to drop emergency supplies into settlements if necessary. <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON> said most rural Alaskans stocked up on essentials before the winter, and only the `` uninitiated'' were likely to get caught short. The National Guard's diesel-powered trucks were among the few vehicles still operating in <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, where the morning temperature of minus 75 warmed to minus 59 by 11 a.m. Friday. A <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> radio station featured an interview with a man who was able to keep his <ORGANIZATION> Datsun </ORGANIZATION> pickup running. The hardy driver described his technique, which involved the use of two heaters _ including one that he moved back and forth under the truck. Even the Kuskokwim 300 sled dog race, which runs between <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Aniak </PERSON>, had to be postponed because of the cold. With temperatures of minus 45 in <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> and considerably lower elsewhere along the route, organizers decided to keep the 20 mushers inside until the temperature rose to at least 25 below.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> concluded what he called a harmonious first week in the White House by urging caution in dealing with the Soviets and giving his support to a 50 percent pay raise for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Holding his first news conference as president on Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> displayed ease and confidence in fielding reporters' questions in a session that ranged in topics from abortion to foreign relations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today was meeting with former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> for a briefing on his recent trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> met with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and delivered personal greetings from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Tonight, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s schedule includes an appearance at the annual dinner of the all-male <ORGANIZATION> Alfalfa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The group each year hosts a humorous dinner with remarks by prominent politicians and business leaders. Despite the club's all-male membership, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` will follow the tradition of past presidents and attend,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The decision was criticized by <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a women's activist and prominent Democratic political consultant, who cited the club as an example of how women are excluded from opportunities to make business connections. She also gave a copy of a rule in the federal personnel manual that states `` federal personnel acting in their official capacities shall not participate in any conference or meetings held in facilities in which discrimination is practiced on the basis of sex, religion or national origin, as well as race.'' Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, is the outgoing president of the club. In his news conference Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> deflected questions about such controversies as a possible fee on deposits at banks and thrift institutions, and the abortion views of Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, his nominee for secretary of health and human services. `` I think it's been a wonderfully harmonious week,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And these are just little ripples on the surface of an otherwise calm pond.'' He downplayed the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plan on the savings account fee, saying that was `` an option, not a proposal.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the administration was reassessing all aspects of U.S.-Soviet relations. He said he does n't think the Soviets consider `` that as foot-dragging. I'm confident they do n't.'' Asked if he felt there still was a `` Cold War'' between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted to avoid the phrase. `` If someone says ` Cold War' to me, that does n't properly give credit to the advances that have taken place in this relationship,'' the president said. `` But if it's used in the context of, are we still unsure of _ in our predictions on <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intentions _ I'd have to say, yes, we should be cautious.'' During his campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared, `` the Cold War is not over.'' On Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted to take the offensive on foreign policy rather than merely react to moves by the Soviets, adding, `` But prudence is the order of the day.'' On other topics, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: _ Said of the pay raise that would bring salaries for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to $ 135,000 a year: `` A raise is overdue, there's no question about that.'' _ Said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` can have an influence'' in winning the release of the American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> even though it does not actually hold them. He recalled `` a period of time when we had excellent relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and I do n't want to think that the status quo has to go on forever.'' _ Discussed this week's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that sharply restricted the ability of state and local governments to reserve a fixed percentage of contracts for minority businesses without proof of past discrimination. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I will not read into that a mandate to me to stop trying on equal employment and on affirmative action generally,'' he said. _ Asked how long his campaign promise against any new taxes would last, said, `` I'd like it to be a four-year pledge.''

 The local staff of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> locked Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> in his office for three hours to press for higher salaries, an embassy source disclosed today. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Lebanese staff, including guards armed with rifles, blocked all entrances to the compound Friday afternoon in the suburb of <LOCATION> Aukar </LOCATION>. They `` prevented anyone from entering'' the ambassador's office. `` The ambassador was there alone all the time,'' the source said. He said the protest `` lasted for about three hours, after which the Lebanese employees decided to call off the move for a week to give the ambassador time to follow up their demands with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' He replied `` no comment'' when asked what the contingent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines stationed at the compound did during the protest. The source said the local staff demanded `` increase of salaries, and -LRB- were -RRB- protesting the lack of benefits for their families.'' He would not elaborate. Some of the guards fired in the air `` in jubilation after the ambassador promised to take up their demands with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' the source said. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, 49, assumed his post on Sept. 24, eight days after his predecessor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, was flown out of the country with a heart ailment. `` Today, the situation is normal at the embassy. But the relationship -LRB- between the Lebanese and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> employees -RRB- will never be the same,'' the source added. He estimated the Lebanese staff at the embassy at 500, but said he could not tell how many were involved in the incident. Most junior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employees have been withdrawn from war-torn <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for security considerations the past four years.

The elections commission announced one of the seats for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, the lower house of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s parliament, had been won because it was uncontested by a member of Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Peoples Party.

The polls are taking place in districts where candidates in last November's general elections won more than one seat, or the vote was postponed because a candidate died. The outcome of the polls can not dent the position of Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who heads the federal government in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> on the basis of her sizeable majority, bolstered by support from smaller groups and independent lawmakers.

<HEAD>Federal Medical Prison Looks More Like College Campus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Doctors and nurses scurry to make their rounds and patients in wheelchairs and gurneys fill the halls. It looks like an ordinary hospital but the patients are convicted felons, among them swindlers and spies. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> could just as easily be a college campus with its open spaces, tree-lined walkways and outdoor recreational facility that includes a basketball court, ice rink and jogging path. The combined prison and hospital moved onto the grounds of a former state hospital that closed in 1982. `` We want the appearance to be reasonably attractive,'' said Warden <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogan </PERSON>. `` We think it would be unproductive and unwise to tear down the trees, remove the grass and put in concrete.'' The tranquil scene has its limits. The 55-acre center is surrounded by a double razor-wire fence, patrol trucks carrying armed guards circle the complex and computerized sensing devices detect movement along the perimeter. But unlike most federal prisons, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> concentrates security on the perimeter and allows inmates relative freedom inside the fences. There are no bars on the windows of the low-to-medium-security facility and inmates do not need passes to move about the campus. The prison, located in this southeastern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> town of 60,000 that's home to the <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, admits federal convicts who need medical or psychiatric care. The only similar institution, the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisoners </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, is a high-security facility. In <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, guards within the perimeter do not carry weapons. Inmates are aware of the prison's policy that it will not give in to the demands of prisoners in the event of a hostage situation, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chreno </PERSON>, executive assistant to the warden, said recently. No one has tried to escape since the first prisoners arrived in October 1984, he said. `` You would n't even know you're in prison here,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenow </PERSON>, who is serving a three-year sentence for tax evasion. <PERSON> Rosenow </PERSON> works in the prison's business office during the day and takes classes at night. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON>, who is serving time for a fraud conviction, described the atmosphere as `` much more relaxed'' than other prisons. `` My idea of being incarcerated was the bar -LRB- on the windows -RRB- scene, but we're mostly free to move around here,'' he said. <PERSON> Bogan </PERSON> defended the prison against criticism that it coddles criminals. `` Most of our inmates will be back among us eventually and it's in society's best interests not to brutalize them,'' he said The hospital, which employs eight full-time physicians, 57 nurses and 72 other medical personnel, can treat most illnesses except those requiring kidney dialysis, <PERSON> Chreno </PERSON> said. The prisoners often go to the nearby Mayo Clinic for treatment, and clinic doctors come to the prison for consulting work or to perform surgery. `` Patients come here for everything from severe mental disorders to personality disorders to terminal cancer to orthopedic work,'' <PERSON> Chreno </PERSON> said. `` We represent a cross section of the illnesses of society. There's nothing in society that's not represented by some offender.'' About half of the prison's approximately 580 patients work in the kitchen, on the grounds crew or in a factory which makes cables for the government. About 120 inmates are there for medical reasons, about 75 for psychiatric treatment and others for chemical dependency. Criminals who have spent time at <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> include <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who was sentenced in January 1986 to life in prison for spying for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, the former mayor of <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, sentenced to 10 years for running an extortion-kickback scheme; and <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, who is serving a five-year term for helping her husband sell documents to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The prison drew opposition when the plans for it were announced. <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyce </PERSON>, who led the fight, said she still believes prisons do n't belong in neighborhoods. `` But it's here now and we're not going to sit and crab about it forever,'' she said.

 Searchers who set out to find the remains of two of serial killer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s victims were forced to postpone one search until spring because of snow and frozen ground. `` We found some really promising places, but the snow's just too deep,'' <LOCATION> Carbon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said after a daylong hunt for the remains of a victim believed to be 15-year-old <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>. `` We've called it off until the spring. We need some snow melt, and we'll wait until the ground is dry and we have warmer temperatures,'' <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, a search for another victim's remains got under way near Capitol Reef National Park and a third search was planned today along <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 89 in central <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Yet another could begin next week near Grand Junction, Colo. In an effort to make the most of <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s flurry of eleventh-hour confessions, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday it would convene a meeting of law enforcement agents from around the country in an attempt to clear up unsolved slayings linked to the executed killer. The meeting will take place in <LOCATION> Quantico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, within three weeks if the schedules of various investigators allow it, according to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> major case specialist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. In the days before his execution last Tuesday, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, 42, confessed to 23 killings. Investigators believe he may have committed as many as 100 slayings beginning in 1969. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> has been suspected in killings, solved and unsolved, in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 20-20'' on Friday aired an emotional telephone conversation between <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and the mother of victim <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rancourt </PERSON>. The conversation, arranged by a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> television station, took place the day of <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s death. Mrs. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, her voice quavering, told <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Rancourt </PERSON> of <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>: `` I've said it before and I'm glad to be able to say it again directly to one of the moms, we do n't know why this happened and we feel so desperately sorry for you. We did n't want our son to do this. ... I am sorry.'' `` I know you are,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rancourt </PERSON> replied. `` And we -LRB- do n't -RRB- hold any resentment or hatred toward you or your family.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rancourt </PERSON>'s 18-year-old daughter, a student at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, disappeared in 1974. The following year, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> disappeared while attending a youth conference at <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in June. In a confession shortly before his execution, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> recalled taking a girl from the <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> campus in <LOCATION> Provo </LOCATION>, killing her and burying the body south of Price, about 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Provo </LOCATION>. Before the search for Ms. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>' body was called off Friday, more than 20 search and rescue team members pinpointed four promising spots along a highway outside Price. Searchers using metal detectors scanned the snow in hope of picking up signals from the girl's dental braces. But the only positive signal was found to be from a piece of a steel-belted radial tire, <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said. Officials from the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office met with investigators in <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to search an area near <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said he buried 17-year-old <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Holladay </LOCATION>, who disappeared in October 1974. A third search, along <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 89, was planned today by Bountiful police seeking to find the remains of <PERSON> Debi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>, 17, who disappeared in November 1975. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> confessed to the slayings of Ms. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> and disclosed the proximate locations of their remains during an interview two days before his execution for the murder of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> schoolgirl <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, 12. He confessed to the third <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> slaying and the slaying of <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliverson </PERSON> of Grand Junction, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, during a tape-recorded interview with <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> prison authorities 45 minutes before he was strapped into the electric chair. Sgt. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> of the Grand Junction Police Department said officials probably will decide Monday whether to search for the body.

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has joined the growing ranks of prosecutors and political leaders calling for the resignation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, who is under fire for a variety of alleged improprieties. `` The situation has been an embarrassment for months and months and months,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Friday. `` I do n't think this appointment should ever have been made.'' Twenty-eight of the 39 federal prosecutors in Massachussetts called for the removal or resignation of <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, who is their boss, saying his presence is jeopardizing the credibility of their office. Criticism of <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, a 41-year-old Republican appointed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1987, has been growing since November, when the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it could find no basis for his allegations that his predecessor, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, smoked marijuana at a party. Shortly thereafter, <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> admitted that he had smoked marijuana as recently as four years ago. More recently, he has been criticized for pressing investigations that were allegedly aimed at discrediting Democrats, including <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> declined comment Friday. Asked how he could continue his duties under the circumstances, he replied, `` You have to address that question to somebody else, because I do n't have any comment.'' Prosecutors in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> offices under <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>'s command sent a letter Friday to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> urging him to fire the embattled chief prosecutor. `` Because Mr. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> will neither resign nor step aside temporarily, the credibility and operations of this office will continue to be damaged, perhaps irretrievably, unless he is removed,'' the letter said. Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., said if no action is forthcoming from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, `` then I think -LRB- congressional -RRB- hearings will be necessary.

 Some anti-abortion protesters convicted on charges stemming from last summer's demonstrations say they will not pay their $ 500 fines, the leader of an anti-abortion group said. Nine men were convicted Friday in <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> of criminal trespassing and unlawful assembly for blocking entrances and driveways at the Feminist Women's Health Center on Aug. 10. The nine were fined $ 500 each and given six months probation. But <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsh </PERSON>, local director of the New York-based anti-abortion organization Operation Rescue, met with the men after the trial and said later that several planned to refuse to pay the fine. `` We will go toe-to-toe with the system at every opportunity and we'll continue to until they lay us in our graves and outlaw abortion,'' <PERSON> Hirsh </PERSON> said. The jury deliberated about 20 minutes after hearing two days of testimony in the case, which stemmed from a series of demonstrations organized in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> by Operation Rescue that landed more than 1,000 protesters in jail. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said the convictions set an important precedent. `` It's important as a symbol,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` I think it's clear now that the public is not, and will not, be willing to accept <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> and its illegal tactics.

 Several armed civilians who took over an suburban army base escaped a military counterattack and may be preparing another assault, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s attorney general says. `` We know that in this attack more people participated than were killed or arrested,'' <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Alessio </PERSON> told a news conference Friday. <PERSON> D'Alessio </PERSON> said a former leader of the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorriaran </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlo </PERSON>, took part in the attack, but offered no proof of his involvement `` His participation is presumed, taking into account his former guerrilla activity, his training and the connection he had in recent times with -LRB- leftist groups -RRB-,'' <PERSON> D'Alessio </PERSON> said. The government says 60 leftist guerrillas staged the assault. The armed civilians battled soldiers for 27 hours, and 38 people died, including 28 guerrillas. Eighteen of the attackers were captured. <PERSON> D'Alessio </PERSON> said police have interrogated the survivors and jailed two more people.

<HEAD>More Assault Rifles Turned In Under Buyback Program</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A city councilman's campaign to buy back semiautomatic assault rifles has taken a curious turn, with one group of people turning in weapons shortly after buying them at gun stores. The five people, who turned in seven assault rifles, intend to donate the $ 2,100 they received to families of the victims in the <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> schoolyard shooting, a spokesman for the group said Friday. `` We do not want to profiteer or benefit from their tragedy,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, spokesman for a group of <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuys </PERSON> real estate office workers. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, 37, said the five parents were shocked by the Jan. 17 shooting that killed five children and wounded 30 others, including a teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The killer, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, used a semiautomatic AK-47 assault rifle to shoot the pupils and then used a pistol to kill himself. The incident has focused attention on the destructive capabilities of the easily purchased weapons. City Councilman <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, who originated the buyback idea, said a tally Friday evening showed that 42 AK-47s and two Uzi machine pistols had been turned in. <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, who will pay the value of the weapon up to $ 300, said he paid a total of $ 9,841.88 for the weapons. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has supported the campaign against the military style rifles favored by street gangs, and has helped publicize procedures for safely bringing the weapons to its stations. People with police receipts showing they had returned a gun were paid from a $ 50,000 political committee fund that <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, a mayoral candidate, set aside Tuesday. Those who turned in weapons had a chance to pick up an additional $ 300 by taking a copy of the police receipt to radio station <ORGANIZATION> KIIS-FM </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> from Thursday morning through Friday morning. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson-Powell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> KIIS </ORGANIZATION> president and general manager, said she did n't care if people made money off the giveaway. `` Our purpose was to decrease the number of guns on the street. ... We feel that's that many fewer lives that may be needlessly taken in violence,'' she said. One woman bought 13 AK-47s and turned them in Thursday, not for the $ 300, but `` to get them off the shelf,'' said <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>. <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> said the unidentified woman paid a total of $ 5,191.88 for the 13 high-powered weapons, and did n't make a profit by turning them in to authorities. She was paid $ 3,900, or $ 300 per rifle, by <ORGANIZATION> KIIS-FM </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> said his office reimbursed her for the remaining amount. Meanwhile, Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., introduced legislation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Friday to outlaw the possession of semiautomatic firearms <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>'s bill would require civilian owners of fast-firing weapons to turn them over to a law enforcement officer within 30 days after the bill takes effect. Violators would face $ 5,000 fines and five-year prison terms. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> called <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>'s plan a `` stupid piece of legislation'' and said it would mount a strong lobbying campaign to defeat the bill.

 Cubans attending an international conference on the 1962 missile crisis criticized the conduct of their Soviet allies in the incident, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> shut them out of some decisions, a participant said. The <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> conference, which opened Friday, is the first on the topic to bring together representatives of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Each country maintains its own version of what happened in October 1962, when the Soviets deployed nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed a quarantine on the island and demanded and obtained the removal of the missiles. Representatives at the conference include former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> and former Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>. At Friday's session, the Soviets and Americans clashed on whether war was imminent more than a quarter-century ago. `` The American side cited conversations among themselves about whether they'd live to see days in the following week to back their contention that the threat of war was real,'' said a participant. `` On the Soviet side, <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> said the Soviets never at any time acted under the belief that war was a real possibility.'' The proceedings were closed to reporters, and the participant spoke on condition of anonymity. During the session the Cubans complained that the Soviets did not consult them sufficiently during the crisis, the participant said. They also complained the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should have used diplomatic channels to express its demand that the Soviet missiles be withdrawn and to clarify American intentions. <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A.-Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> think tank, told the conference Soviet Premier <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> erred in shipping nuclear missiles to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> because he had n't anticipated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reaction and that he humiliated his country, the participant said Other Soviet officials at the session, however, praised <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> as a `` great statesman'' who succeeded in getting the Americans to pledge not to invade <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The discussions are organized by <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>. At a conference sponsored by the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> school in 1987, Americans and Soviets met to review the crisis, but the meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is the first to include <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> representatives, led by <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Risquet </PERSON>, a member of his <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s governing Politburo. Seated around an oval table topped with blue felt, <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participants _ including <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON> _ are exchanging thoughts with Soviets including <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobrynin </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a message read at the ceremony by <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, called the session the `` latest example of the new openness'' under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said international security would be helped by closer study of the Cuban missile crisis. `` This can only improve our mutual understanding of just the sort of episode we must avoid in the nuclear age,'' he said. In his own message of greetings, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called on participants to `` think over and draw lessons from this event that brought the world to the brink of the nuclear precipice.''

 The coast guard today found two more bodies believed to be crewmen of a freighter that collided with another vessel and sank off western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, maritime officials said. The discovery brought to six the number of bodies recovered after the 2,900-ton Catherine-Rose, a Panamanian-registered cargo ship carrying 17 South Korean crew members, sank Thursday off Yoshimi-cho, 530 miles west of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The six had not yet been identified, said <PERSON> Yasushi </PERSON> <PERSON> Horie </PERSON> of the Moji branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s coast guard. Six boats, two helicopters and a plane were searching the area today, <PERSON> Horie </PERSON> said. On Friday night, police arrested a deck officer of the other ship _ the 2,400-ton <PERSON> Semba </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> _ in connection with the collision, <PERSON> Horie </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-kyo </PERSON>, 48, was the vessel's duty officer at the time of the accident, <PERSON> Horie </PERSON> noted. He declined to elaborate.

The Catherine-Rose, bound for the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>, had a cargo of 3,000 tons of scrap steel. The <PERSON> Samba </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> was traveling from <LOCATION> Yosu </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s southwestern coast to <LOCATION> Mizushima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, 350 miles west of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, officials said

 After touring the scene of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s recent riots, a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> congressman accused police of being `` trigger-happy'' and said he could sense the seeds of discontent among the area's black residents. `` There's a lot of pent-up frustration in this -LRB- area -RRB-, anger, bitterness,'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> said Friday as he stood in front of the charred ruins of a grocery store in the predominantly black <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> neighborhood. At another point he told a resident who was concerned about a lack of jobs: `` <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> has been shorted. The question is how did it happen and what we can do.'' <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights, promised to help coordinate relief for <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>. The fatal shooting of a black motorcylist by a Hispanic police officer on Jan. 16 sparked three days of burning, looting and violence. The motorcyclist's passenger died of injuries sustained in an ensuing wreck. The unrest spilled over into the <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area, and left one dead, 11 wounded by gunfire and about $ 1 million in structural damage, not including the buildings' contents. <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, who was invited to tour the area by <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, president of the local chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, told cheering residents at a community meeting that there are `` too many trigger-happy policemen abusing the rights of black people in this area.'' The Democrat also charged that federal funding the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration promised in the aftermath of riots in 1980 was later cut by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. For example, he said, of $ 40 million in loans slated for small business owners, only $ 16 million ever made it into the community. Of $ 10 million for low-income housing, only $ 2 million came through for <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>, he said. `` It's part of the legacy of broken promises to <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> said.

 A bomb tossed at a passing police car from the roof of a nearby building exploded today, killing one policeman and injuring two others, officials said. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack in the border village of <LOCATION> Sion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mills </LOCATION> in west <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, but suspicion fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is fighting British rule in the province. A spokesman at police headquarters in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> said the three policemen were driving down the main street of the village when someone standing in the doorway of a pub signaled for them to stop. Not realizing it was an ambush, the policemen halted their car and one got out to investigate. An assailant then threw a bomb at the car from the roof of a nearby building, wrecking the car, police said. One of the two officers inside the vehicle died of his injuries as he was being taken to a hospital, and the other officer inside the car was badly hurt, police said. The third policeman was also slightly injured when about 200 people spilling out of a nearby discotheque pelted him with bottles as he went to the aid of his colleagues, police said. A woman near the scene was treated for shock, police said. The noisy crowd also attacked army and police arriving at the scene but was dispersed when the reinforcements fired a rubber bullet, said the police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite it with the mostly <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>GNP Growth Strong For 1988; Dollar Continues Its Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Wall Street cheered a government report that indicated the nation's economy lost some of its steam in the fourth quarter of 1988, easing fears that the pace of economic growth could fuel inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that the nation's gross national product slowed to 2.0 percent in the fourth quarter. The figure was below Wall Street's expectations and provided fresh evidence that the economy was slowing to a sustainable pace. The report also said the economy grew a healthy 3.8 percent for all of 1988. Bond traders welcomed the fourth-quarter growth figure by bidding up prices of long-term government bonds _ thereby pushing interest rates lower _ which provided fresh momentum for Wall Street's ongoing rally Brokers said a rise in the dollar in foreign-exchange trading Friday also helped stir investors' enthusiasm for stocks. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks climbed 31.79 points to 2,322.86, bringing its gain for the week to 87.50 points. The government said the 1988 GNP figure benefited from a narrowing of the trade deficit and a large increase in business investment. The increase came even though growth slowed sharply in the final three months of the year to the slowest quarterly performance in two years. Commenting on the GNP report, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said the fourth-quarter slowdown was not a warning that the six-year record peacetime economic recovery was in endangered and should not overshadow the stellar performance of the economy for all of 1988. The GNP report also indicated inflation picked up during the year, with a price index tied to the GNP rising by 4.2 percent, the fastest increase since a 6.2 percent rise in 1982. Analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> likely will consider the inflation level too high and keep up its pressure on interest rates. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday played down any differences between the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>. `` He is more concerned about inflation pressures than I am right now,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` It seems to me there is an area of difference. But generally speaking, I think we are fairly close together.''

 Singer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has apparently forsaken the concert stage at age 30, giving what was billed as his last performance. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, appearing an hour late after being mobbed backstage by celebrity well-wishers, took the stage Friday night amid a vapor mist and the deafening roar of a capacity crowd at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. `` Since this is the last concert there was a big mob scene backstage,'' publicist <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Solters </PERSON> said early today. `` A lot of people were wishing him well.'' Dozens of stretch limousines were on hand, carrying stars such as actors <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, <PERSON> Raquel </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> and singers <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dionne </PERSON> <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> and members of the heavy metal group <ORGANIZATION> Motley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crue </ORGANIZATION>. Many fans said they had waited weeks to see <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who canceled December shows in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> because of strained vocal cords. Tickets for the farewell show were fetching prices well beyond their face value. <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 35, who attended the concert with her 9-year-old daughter, <LOCATION> Barika </LOCATION>, said she was offered $ 100 for her $ 27.50 loge seat but turned it down. `` It was tempting since I could've let <LOCATION> Barika </LOCATION> go in with her aunt and uncle,'' Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` But she said, ` No Mommy, you got ta go.' And I figured if it's <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s last concert, I may as well be part of history.'' Although Friday's show was billed as a farewell performance, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s manager backed off from saying the reclusive performer would never appear in concert again. `` I'm not saying he's not going to perform live again, but I do n't think we'll ever go out on tour like this,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dileo </PERSON> said. The show marked the end of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s `` Bad'' tour, a grueling, 16-month effort that took him around the world. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, celebrated as widely for his eccentricities as for his songs, vocals and choreography, intends to keep recording and is considering film roles, <PERSON> Solters </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has n't granted an interview since 1984, is said to be interested in movies, writing, producing and directing. Taking the stage accompanied by bodyguards, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> sang and danced his way through a number of his hits Friday night, backed by dancers dressed as punk rockers, monsters and street gang members. He used his signature `` moonwalk'' movements to glide across stage, singing such songs as `` Starting Something,'' `` The Way You Make Me Feel'' and `` Man in the Mirror,'' as the audience howled and stomped in approval.

<TEXT>
 North Korean naval ships today seized two <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> fishing boats with a total of 21 crewmen aboard in international waters off the peninsula's western coast, government officials said. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s official media confirmed the capture but said the ships were deep in its territorial waters. An investigation was under way, the north's official <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said in a dispatch monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The agency said a navy patrol boat had captured the boats in the Yellow Sea. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishery </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> Taeyang </LOCATION> No. 7 and its sister ship, the <LOCATION> Taeyang </LOCATION> No. 8, both 100-ton trawlers, were taken to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> after being stopped near the territorial limit. The Taeyang No. 7 carried 12 crewmen and the Taeyang No. 8 nine crewmen when they were seized by North Korean naval vessels 30 miles west of Paengyong-do, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s western-most island in the <LOCATION> Yellow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, the officials said. The boats apparently were captured without a shot being fired, they said. The South Korean fishing boats left their home port of <LOCATION> Inchon </LOCATION> on Monday and stayed in international waters when North Korean naval craft ordered them to change their course toward the north, they said. The area is close to the sea extension of the Korean Military Demarcation Line that separates the two Koreas roughly along the 38th parallel. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> seized many South Korean fishing boats in the area in the past, but returned most of them. The incident took place at a time when the two Koreas are negotiating to open several different channels of dialogue to ease tension on the peninsula. The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since their land was divided at the end of World War II in 1945. They fought a bloody three-year war after the north invaded in 1950.

 The mouse game, as familiar to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> county fairgoers as Ferris wheels and cotton candy, is destined to become a midway memory. Fair officials attending the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fairs </ORGANIZATION> learned Friday that the mouse game had been declared illegal _ just like the cow chip casino. In the mouse game, players buy numbered tickets in hopes that a mouse, when released, will run down a correspondingly numbered hole on the rim of a spinning table. The director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> LeClair </PERSON>, said any game of chance in which an animal is used to determine the outcome is prohibited by statute. Horse racing is regulated by a separate set of laws. The cow chip contest, in which a cow is turned loose in a fenced-in area lined with numbered squares, became illegal in late September when state police shut down a contest at the Cumberland Fair. The proceeds were to help buy playground equipment at a local school. The head of the licensing division, Sgt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Refnell </PERSON>, confirmed that until the Cumberland Fair incident, he was unaware of the state humane law prohibiting the use of animals. `` That got us thinking about the mice used at the fairs, and they fall under the same rule,'' <PERSON> Refnell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> of <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Fun-O-Rama </PERSON> said his midways did not use the mouse game last year. `` In fact, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> was the only state that I know of that still allowed the game,'' <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> said Friday. `` It's another tradition lost but it wo n't affect me at all.''

 Teamsters union leaders have been called to a meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today to discuss the federal government's offer to settle a racketeering lawsuit, a newspaper reported The Plain Dealer of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> said the union's 16 international vice presidents were notified Friday of the meeting in a message from union President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>. The message said the meeting was to discuss `` pending litigation'' and invited the vice presidents to bring their lawyers, the newspaper said in today's editions. The meeting was called after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> reportedly sent an 18-page settlement proposal to Teamsters general counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> is leaving office next week and was described by one <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> associate as eager to settle the lawsuit he filed against the union in federal court last June, the Plain Dealer said. The suit, which seeks the removal of top officers of the 1.6 million-member union, is scheduled for trial Feb. 27. The newspaper, citing unidentified sources, said the proposed settlement calls for direct election of the union's president, secretary-treasurer and international vice presidents. An independent panel would oversee the elections and monitor union activities. Teamsters have been electing leaders through delegates at conventions every five years.

 The two German war criminals pardoned and returned to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> had `` indirect responsibility'' for sending <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> to her death, a World War II historian said today. But there is no direct link between the Dutch Jewish girl who died in the <LOCATION> Bergen-Belsen </LOCATION> concentration camp and the two elderly Germans freed from prison Friday, said <PERSON> Loe </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON>, considered the nation's foremost authority on World War II. <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, 87, and 79-year-old <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> aus der Fuenten were deported to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after spending 43 years in a Dutch prison. The two were high-ranking Nazi officials responsible for sending thousands of Dutch Jews to their deaths during World War II. Only 6,000 of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>' 150,000 Jews survived Nazi persecution. `` The group that arrested the -LRB- Frank -RRB- family in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> operated under the command of Aus der Fuenten and <PERSON> Aus </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuenten </PERSON> worked under the instructions of <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` It would be correct to say they had indirect responsibility'' for <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s fate. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> is the author of the 14-volume `` History of the Kingdom of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> in World War II,'' a government-commissioned study. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and her family were arrested by a German police unit known as the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> in August 1944, and were first deported to the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp in Nazi-held <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> later was moved to the <LOCATION> Bergen-Belsen </LOCATION> concentration camp in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where she died of pneumonia in 1945 at age 15. From June 1942 until her arrest, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> wrote her diary as the <PERSON> Franks </PERSON> hid in a secret section of an <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> canal house closed off from the rest of the building by a bookshelf. The book, perhaps the most famous personal document to come out of the Holocaust, was published in 1947 and was turned into a play and movie. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> ran the Hague-based Jewish Section of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- SS -RRB-. In that capacity, `` he gave guidelines ... about which Jews should be rounded up,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> said. Aus der <PERSON> Fuenten </PERSON>, an SS administrator who ran what was cynically called the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION> for Jewish Emigration, oversaw the deportations of thousands of Jews from <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> and The Hague. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aus </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuenten </PERSON> were sentenced to death in 1950, but their sentences were commuted to life imprisonment a year later. They were the world's only war criminals who had been jailed since World War II, according to the government, which said keeping them here any longer would violate the principle of equality before the law. The <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> has pardoned and freed 107 other war criminals who had been sentenced to death.

<HEAD>Bill To Tame Tabloids Dies in Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> scuttled legislation intended to protect individuals from intrusive newspaper reporting when the bill's supporters failed to muster enough support to force a vote. Even some legislators whose private lives had become grist for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s racier dailies spoke against the bill on Friday, and the government said remedies already existed. The bill's sponsor, Conservative <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON>, said, `` Preserving privacy is in the public interest. We hope this bill will put water in the moat of everyone's castle.'' After five hours of debate Friday, the bill fell one short of the necessary 100 votes to close debate and vote on whether it should move to the next parliamentary phase _ called a second reading. The House of Commons has 650 members. The legislation would have created a statutory right of privacy and permitted suits for breaches. It would have placed the burden on the newspaper to show that its disclosures were for the public benefit. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member, said he and his family had been subjected to what he called the `` rampaging rat packs of the tabloid press'' following his admission in 1987 that he had had an extramarital affair. But he still opposed the measure. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Renton </PERSON>, minister of state in the Home Office, told legislators there was growing resentment `` at the way some of the tabloid press blatantly exposes private lives.'' However, <PERSON> Renton </PERSON> said the bill in question could prove `` a clumsy instrument.'' <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON>, a Labor member who once worked for the tabloid <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION>, denounced the government's apparent neutrality on the issue. `` There is no doubt at all that the excesses of the sewer Sun and other tabloids have reached such proportions in the quest for sensation and sleaze that action must be now taken,'' <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s tabloids far outsell such respected newspapers as The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> or The Times. The Sun, with circulation of 4.2 million, is read by a quarter of all adults in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, according to readership surveys made in 1986. The tabloid <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> reached 20 percent of adults, while the Telegraph reached 6 percent and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 2 percent.

 A rules change adopted by <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> will allow <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> clubs worldwide to join their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian counterparts in accepting women members. Rotary International's council on legislation, meeting in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, adopted a change in the service club's constitution and bylaws that will allow the 23,900 clubs in 164 countries to admit women starting July 1, club officials said. The new provision will not require that women be included, and clubs in some countries are expected to continue to ban them. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> clubs began admitting women in June 1987 after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law requiring service clubs to admit women. Canadian Rotaries followed last November after clubs in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> argued that exclusion of women violated the country's laws. Nearly 11,000 of the 420,000 Rotarians in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are women. But until this week, international documents of the club still called it an organization for `` adult male persons,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neal </ORGANIZATION>, a spokeswoman at the club's <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION> headquarters said Friday. The legislative council, with members from around the globe, voted 328-117 to change the constitution and bylaws. The new membership provisions will be sent to all clubs. If 10 percent of the clubs oppose the change, the decision will be reconsidered at the Rotary International convention in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in May, Ms. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said.

 A buoyant <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said today he was satisfied with the government's offer to legalize Solidarity and that the country's political outlook had changed. Speaking at a news conference after talks with the government Friday, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has provided `` political guarantees or political openness _ and I think it's sufficient as a guarantee. He also said upcoming talks between the government and opposition, including Solidarity, should progress as quickly as possible because <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s problems are urgent. `` <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> is really scared,'' he said. `` The situation in the country is very difficult. `` But there are terribly difficult and complicated problems and they ca n't be solved that quickly,'' he added. The government and Solidarity leaders announced Friday in a joint communique that talks on re-legalization of the banned Solidarity trade movement and on political and economic reform would begin Feb. 6, according to the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>. The statement also said Friday's session `` discussed the problems of trade union pluralism, including Solidarity.'' `` I am satisfied and very tired,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had told reporters after negotiating Friday for more than 11 hours to set the date for the broader talks. `` I made hours of overtime.'' The joint statement said a preliminary decision had been made to set up three working teams for economic and social policy, political reforms and union pluralism. Participants also agreed to set up groups on agriculture, mining, legal and court reform, self-government, mass media and youth, the communique said. Friday's talks were held in a secluded government house in the woods in <LOCATION> Magdalenka </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> suburb. The government first proposed the talks on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future during a wave of strikes in August, the country's worst labor unrest since the government imposed martial law in December 1981 and crushed Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's only independent trade union movement. The talks appear to be part of a government effort to bring the opposition into the battle to reverse the economic decline that has left <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> with chronic shortages, a daunting foreign debt and a dispirited generation of young people. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was accompanied to the negotiations by a group of seven union activists and advisers, and three representatives of the church. Others with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> included <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> Bishop <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Goclowski </PERSON>; <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON>, the former underground Solidarity leader; and <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil </PERSON>, chairman of Solidarity at the <ORGANIZATION> Nowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huta </ORGANIZATION> steel mill in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>. Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, Politburo member <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciosek </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Reykowski </PERSON>, head of state-radio and television, were among the representatives of the authorities, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has said he would not hold talks on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future until the authorities made a political decision to make the union legal. In a dramatic reversal of policy last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved an offer to allow more than one legal trade union to exist and opposition participation in the government. Solidarity, founded in 1980, was crushed in a December 1981 military crackdown and banned the next year.

<HEAD>West German Official Backs Nuclear Missile Changes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Defense Minister <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense specialists he supports plans to modernize short-range nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. However, critics at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> session immediately fired back that his speech was too vague in outlining <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s position on a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> call for extending the range of such missiles. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> that it appeared `` you kind of want to have it both ways.'' In his speech to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense experts meeting in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> laid out a middle ground between the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> proposals and West German public opinion, which is strongly against such changes. <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> said only that <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> missiles `` must be kept modern.'' He gave no details. The first day of the annual weekend strategy conference produced heated debate over various issues facing the alliance's 16 members. When <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> mentioned <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s resistance to picking up more of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s expenses, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participants charged that Europeans have not been pulling their financial weight. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> got a round of applause when he arrived at the conference but sat quietly through the sharp exchanges. Another major issue was how the West should respond to Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s disarmament overtures. A 1983 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> decision to refit existing short-range missiles to extend their range beyond the current limit of 300 miles is increasingly unpopular among Europeans, especially West Germans. Many of them see the plan as an obstacle to further arms control reductions. <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> echoed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> skepticism about the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s willingness to relinquish its military might but skirted direct mention of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s attitude toward missile modifications. In the dispute over <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> expenses, <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> said that as much as 60 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military budget goes for NATO-related defense. He said European members must accept additional alliance costs. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Luttwak </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> told the gathering that `` in the last 20 years, other people have been living inside the house of strategic security without paying the rent.'' <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> also drew fire from West German opposition Social Democrat <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Voigt </PERSON>, who said the defense minister failed to take a clear stand on the issue of missile modifications. `` You were really perfect when it comes to being vague,'' said <PERSON> Voigt </PERSON>, who opposes the proposed modifications.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a dynamo of action, getting to work early, staying late and saying there were no surprises to wipe the smile off his face. On the other hand, he did n't have to make any tough decisions in his first week as president. `` No one is naive enough to assume that what we think has been a good two days will define the 1,458 days between now and inauguration, 1993, but it is, I hope, the kind of quality that could be expected,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said in an early assessment. It was a brisk first-week pace. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> delighted congressional leaders of both parties with a meeting that sparked talk of a honeymoon. He called dozens of foreign leaders. He scheduled trips over the next month to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. He stressed ethics in government. He met with the press three times. He went jogging and turned up at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Cathedral, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and Constitution Hall. While refusing to draw a comparison with the detached, hands-off style of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a White House official said one of the most interesting aspects of the first week was that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> demonstrated a curiosity about what was happening. `` He's poked his head into several staff people to ask what they're doing, to see how projects are coming,'' said the official, who asked not to be identified by name. `` Most of the people on the staff, by the end of the week, had received a note of one kind or another from him that either told of a phone call he had made on a subject of their interest or asked about a project in their area or somehow identified he was involved in a project they were working on.'' Up before dawn, the new president was in the Oval Office around 7:15 a.m. each day and stayed until after 6 p.m. most nights. `` It's been a good, easy week,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday at a relaxed, fast-moving news conference. `` And I expect it will change dramatically in the days ahead.'' Suffering from a cold that left him hoarse, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` If it were n't for the cold _ smile and enjoy it while you can because I can already sense, you know, looking forward to a little more _ little more confrontation out there.'' The news conference provided a sharp contrast between the styles of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. For his infrequent meetings with reporters, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> studied briefing papers and sample questions for days and then held at least two dress rehearsals with his staff. Sometimes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was among those in the audience to critique the answers. At the actual news conferences, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> often seemed ill at ease and the sessions often turned out to have little news value. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a veterans of more than two decades of government service and a specialist on foreign policy matters, did not need much preparation for his news conference, aides said. He was given a list of some of the questions that had come up in the daily briefings of press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, but there were no practice sessions. Standing in the press room, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed confident and in high spirits, calling on many reporters by name and interrupting the news conference at one point to turn the table on reporters and grill them about the practice of asking follow-up questions. There were early tastes of trouble with a new controversy over the abortion views of Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, his nominee for secretary of health and human services, and an uproar over a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> proposal to rescue the savings and loan industry by charging a depositor fee. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed aside the flaps as `` little ripples on the surface of an otherwise calm pond.'' The ripples are likely to get bigger _ soon. By Feb. 9, the date of his address before a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has to decide who wins and who loses in the battle for federal funds, as he divides up a shrinking budget pie and struggles to cut the deficit. Privately, White House officials are passing the word that there wo n't be enough money for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to keep all his campaign promises for education and other programs for his `` kinder and gentler'' nation. `` Look, I do n't expect it's going to be all sweetness and harmony and light,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The minute we get those proposals up there on Feb. 9, I expect we're going to have other firestorms swirling around.'' House Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., came away from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s meeting with congressional leaders saying, `` We're going to get tough when we get the specifics -LRB- on the budget -RRB- but there's no need to get the specifics today <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at midweek he was putting in a lot of time on the budget but that progress was slow. `` I think it's a little early to make conclusions one way or another on all that,'' he said. House Minority Whip <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., said, `` The honeymoon is still on _ two more days, three more days Enjoy it while it lasts.''

 When night falls over this capital, <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> soldiers, shabbily dressed, but armed with Russian-made Kalashnikov rifles, stop automobiles at every city block. Their jerky movements betray their nervousness. At the airport across the city, an Afghan army general sees off a family on a flight to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>.

 This is <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. As the last days slip away before the Soviet army is due to leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15, a 10-year civil war rages on, nobody knows what will happen next, suspicion and fear are widespread, and no one looks like a winner. Without the Soviets, the survival prospects of the pro-Marxist regime of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> are counted in months by most Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The seven groups of Moslem rebels, whose commanders control great swaths of the countryside as warlords, are divided among themselves. Hundreds of towns and villages are wrecked by Soviet and Afghan bombing raids, an estimated 1 million people have been killed in the conflict and 5 million _ a third of the population _ have fled to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, whose costly military intervention began in 1979, stands condemned by the West and many Third World countries as an occupying superpower that met with gallant resistance from guerrilla fighters.

 On the drab, icy streets of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Soviets look like wearied colonial administrators in the dying days of an empire as they distribute airlifted emergency rations from armored vehicles to cold and hungry crowds who throng handout points, even though they say they're delighted the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is going. Soviet commanders, keen to publicize the handouts and coy about the withdrawal and whether promises of continued military assistance to <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> will include more bombing raids, grumble openly about Afghan inefficiency. `` The local administration did not give out the orders in time for when they needed to get food supplies,'' said Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON>, No. 2 in the Soviet high command here, and the traders are hoarding to raise prices. Still, he acknowledges that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Afghan adventure has gone wrong. `` We came here with a very honorable task, with open hearts ... we are leaving, and we have a sense of not having accomplished our mission to the end,'' he told Western reporters. The <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> mayor, Afghan army Gen. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, claims the city has a three-month stockpile of food and fuel to withstand any blockade by rebels _ now entrenched on the outskirts _ once the Soviets go. But Western diplomats say reserves are virtually exhausted. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> aid officials warn that without more emergency supplies the capital of more than 2 million people, half of them war refugees from the provinces, faces disaster. The West provides little more than token aid, refusing to deal with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s administration. The Soviets, meanwhile, appear unwilling to ditch <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, or to take him off to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the hope of forging a last-minute agreement on a coalition in which the rebel leaders would sit with at least some of the Marxists.

 Despite the efforts of the Soviets, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> and a 35,000-strong secret police, the Khad, the hold of Marxism appears as shaky as everything else. A state silo supplies the flour, but private traders increase the bread prices in shanty-like stores. In the bazaars the money changers operate as openly as the rug traders. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar now fetches 230 Afghans, up from 180 a few months ago and more than four times the official rate. This is a city where a money trader seated on upturned crate in the street solemnly checks the passports of foreign customers; where lines of vehicles waiting for fuel encircle blocks while black makerteers tip cans from street-side hoards into the tanks of the better off. Bursts of small arms fire and explosions ring out at night.

 The small group of Western journalists in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> are gathered at the <ORGANIZATION> Intercontinental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, on a hillside overlooking the capital. It is the sole hotel in the city with a telex and the only one left with central heating. Even there, power cuts are frequent. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> tries to keep a close watch on reporters, assigning them guides-interpreters with English ranging for the hesistant to the fluent. The cars supplied by the state operate on near-empty tanks replenished a few gallons at a time on the black market by drivers who pay with sheafs of local currency they haul around in carrier bags. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, inundated with visa applications from journalists, clamped down on issuing new visas in early January. Western diplomats suspect the move followed orders from the Soviet high command seeking to pull troops out of the capital with the minimum of publicity. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> says it acted because it does not have enough interpreters _ known by reporters as `` minders'' _ and cars to cope.

 Meanwhile, the quiet Soviet pullout continues. The Soviets have handed over some key perimeter posts round the city to the Afghan army, stripped army recreation rooms at the airport, and head north in armored columns up the 250-mile <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway to the Soviet border. Under a U.N.-mandated agreeement, 50,000 Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> left by Aug. 15 and the remaining 50,000 are to be gone by the February deadline. Embassies, including the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, have run down their staffs and evacuated foreign families. Whatever happens after the Soviets go, it is hard to find an Afghan who believes there will be peace. `` It's all been a big mistake, the war, the Soivets coming here,'' said airline mechanic <PERSON> Anargul </PERSON> <PERSON> Eshaqza </PERSON>, as he waited in a gasline fuel line. `` Peace? Maybe in another 10 years.''

 Thirty years ago the communist bloc shattered with the bitter rift between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Today, the world's two largest communist states are picking up the pieces of their long-lost solidarity. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> arrives Thursday to advance the accelerating process of political normalization between the two countries. His visit is expected to lay the groundwork for Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit during the spring for the first Sino-Soviet summit since <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> met for bitterly divisive talks in 1959. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s talks with senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and other officials will formally end a freeze on party and government relations that began when the two nations split over ideological and strategic differences in 1960. Economic and cultural relations have seen steady improvement since the two sides first embarked on political normalization talks in 1982. Trade last year was an estimated $ 2.8 billion, up from $ 300 million in 1982. The two countries will exchange nearly 1,000 scholars this year, compared to 10 in 1983. Sister programs are being formed, joint ventures established and tours conducted across borders once demarcated by barbed wire and bayonets. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s hard-line stance toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has softened in the past year as it joins the world trend toward detente and perceives major progress in what it labels the `` three obstacles'' to normal ties with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The most important obstacle, Soviet support for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, remains the toughest to overcome But in August the two sides for the first time met face-to-face on the issue and agreed it was time for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to get out. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, backer of the anti-Vietnam resistance in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, has welcomed <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s plans to withdraw its troops by September <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who has actively pursued an end to Sino-Soviet ill-will, has taken steps to remove the other two obstacles by pledging to end the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> occupation of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and to reduce by 200,000 men the Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> _ mainly on the tense Sino-Soviet border. Despite the heady progress, the real interests of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as it strives to bring better lives to its 1 billion people remain in furthering its economic, technological and even cultural ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Chinese leaders insist they will never return to the Sino-Soviet relations of the 1950s, when <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> depended on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s economic largesse and obediently adhered to its strategic interests. That halcyon period, once described as `` lasting, unbreakable and invincible,'' actually comprised only a brief interlude in a long history of distrust and hostility between the two nations. <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> showed disdain for <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s peasant-based revolutionaries, and forced the Chinese communists to ally with the stronger Nationalists in the 1920s and 1930s even when <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-Shek </PERSON>'s Nationalists were bent on their destruction. The Soviets called the Chinese `` radish communists'' _ red on the outside but white on the inside. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> continued to send arms to the Nationalists during the 1937-45 war against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, even though <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> spent most of his energies fighting <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s forces rather than the Japanese. In the early 1950s, shortly after the communist victory over the Nationalists in 1949, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> provided <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with loans and technical assistance for heavy industry and several thousand military advisers. But relations rapidly deteriorated, in part because of personal antipathy between <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s successor. The turning point was <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s 1956 denunciation of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> thought <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> was trying to usurp control of the communist world and said his efforts to ease tensions with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were undermining the unity of the communist bloc. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> believed <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s communes and radical socialism were nonsense. In 1959 <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> rescinded on an offer to supply <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> with a `` sample'' atomic bomb, and in the summer of 1960 the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> stopped all aid to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, pulling out more than 1,000 technicians and effectively terminating more than 200 Soviet-backed industrial projects. In 1962, aroused by Soviet propaganda, 60,000 Moslem Kazakhs in the far western <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Xinjiang </LOCATION> fled to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, while others staged uprisings against Chinese troops. That same year <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> continued to supply advanced jets to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, then fighting a border war with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The two countries veered close to war in 1969, when fighting broke out along their disputed 5,000-mile border. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> claimed huge tracts of land it said Tsarist <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> had seized in `` unequal treaties'' of the 19th century. Chinese leaders, partly to unify a nation then in the throes of the leftist Cultural Revolution, launched a campaign to store grain, dig air raid tunnels and move factories into the hinterlands in preparation for a Soviet invasion. The invasion never came, but throughout the 1970s both sides maintained more than 1 million troops along the boundary. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s assertion that the Soviet `` hegemonists'' represented the biggest threat to peace was a key factor in the resumption of relations in the 1970s with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> only began to improve after <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s death in 1976 and the emergence of the pragmatic <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, who says there is no imminent threat of war and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> must devote its energies to economic development.

 A rare first edition of the 16th century book `` <PERSON> Rimas </PERSON>,'' considered the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> equivalent to the works of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, has vanished from <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. The missing 1595 `` <PERSON> Rimas </PERSON>,'' or `` Rhymes,'' by <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Camoes </PERSON>, is one of only six copies of the book known to exist, said <PERSON> Edwaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Machado </PERSON> <PERSON> Cafezeiro </PERSON>, head of the university's literature school. Its value is incalculable, <PERSON> Cafezeiro </PERSON> said in announcing Thursday that the book was missing. `` It's worth a fortune to a collector _ $ 10 million is very possible,'' he said. `` And there is a market for rare works.'' The yellowed book disappeared after rains and floods last year damaged the university library, <PERSON> Cafezeiro </PERSON> said. Rare books in the collection were moved to dry rooms, but an inventory later showed 150 to 200 works were missing. Also among the missing was a valuable second edition of `` Rimas'' published in 1598, <PERSON> Cafezeiro </PERSON> said. However, the gem of the collection, a copy of <PERSON> Camoes </PERSON>' other masterpiece, `` Os Lusiadas,'' was saved. After months of searching, the university called the federal police. The investigation was kept secret at the request of police until now. `` We need help to recover this work. It's a genuine treasure of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Cafezeiro </PERSON> said. The theft of antiques is common in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, especially the robbery of carvings and precious metal ornaments from the many colonial-era churches.

<HEAD>Officials Say Some Minority Programs Will Escape Supreme Court Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER PETTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Many state and municipal governments say they are confident they will escape the effects of last week's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling striking down a racial quota system for public-works contracts because their plans are less strict. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> are among the exceptions, and officials there say some programs may be jeopardized. The justices, by a 6-3 vote, struck down a program in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, that required white-owned companies bidding on any city contract to set aside 30 percent of the contract's value for minority-owned subcontractors. The ruling said rigid racial quotas must be supported by evidence of past discrimination; for example, that black-owned enterprises tried to obtain construction contracts but were denied them. Without such evidence, the use of racial quotas violates the equal-protection rights of whites, the court said. But many state affirmative action programs are voluntary, have goals rather than mandatory targets for minority participation, or were based on evidence of discrimination, said a sampling of officials contacted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> authorities are confident the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will uphold their law, which requires 7 percent of all purchasing and construction grants to go to minority-owned businesses and 5 percent to go to businesses owned by women. State officials say they believe enough evidence about discrimination was presented before the law took effect. `` It took 10 years of bill introductions and hearings to get it through the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> program that took effect this month should survive an expected challenge because it sets goals, not absolute quotas, of 15 percent for minority participation in state business and 5 percent for women-owned companies, said <ORGANIZATION> Assemblywoman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maxine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waters </ORGANIZATION>. However, attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Findley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said minority contracting plans in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> have one thing in common with the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> measure: `` There's no showing of past discrimination and a program designed specifically to remedy it.'' According to the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>'s population research unit, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 27.8 million population is 24 percent Hispanic, 7 percent black, and 9 percent Asian and others. <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> requires prime contractors to subcontract 20 percent of a project's worth to minority contractors and 3 percent to women, but <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> said the city addressed the high court's major objections to <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>'s law. `` We held lengthy hearings and established a clear and convincing record of past discrimination against minority contractors,'' Ms. <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> is 54 percent black. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling has an economic effect in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> is 52 percent minority, according to City Manager <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bobb </PERSON>. Before the ordinance went into effect, less than 1 percent of the city's construction work was awarded to minority companies, he said. During the life of the ordinance, minority companies were awarded about 40 percent of the city's work. Since the law's suspension in July 1987 because of the litigation, the percentage has dropped back below 2 percent, <PERSON> Bobb </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is considering a challenge to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s 35 percent minority business enterprise program, and officials of the black-majority city fear the state court might take its cue from the ruling in the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> case `` The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> program has almost exactly the same defects that <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>'s has,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative group challenging <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s program. Last year <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> awarded $ 24.9 million in jobs to minority-owned businesses, 36.7 percent of all of its contracts. More than $ 300 million in city business has gone to minority contractors since the 35 percent minority set-aside program was established in 1975. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said he feared the ruling could jeopardize some of his city's affirmative action programs in development, hiring and contracts. A city ordinance adopted in 1987 required <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to award 15 percent of all contracts to businesses owned by minorities and 5 percent to businesses owned by women. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> is about 35 percent minority. Minorities and women received $ 27 million in city contracts in fiscal 1988, about 14 percent of the total eligible dollars, said <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, director of the mayor's <ORGANIZATION> Minority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. That compares with $ 15.2 million in fiscal 1985. A <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> law guarantees minority companies 10 percent or more of state and some local government business, and various localities have similar laws. <PERSON> Angelisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minority </ORGANIZATION> and Women's Business Enterprise, said that while the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> ruling may force <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> to provide additional documentation to justify its programs, she believes they will be able to continue operating.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> says he will not pick a fight with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to demonstrate his independence as the new Democratic party chairman, but that there are bound to be conflicts with the presidential candidate he worked for in 1988. `` I'm not looking for it, trying to orchestrate it,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in an interview last week in advance of succeeding <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in the party post. `` I'm sure at one time or another I'll have the opportunity to demonstrate independence from any of the potential candidates in ` 92.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s election to the party chairmanship was assured last week when three of his four rivals for the post dropped out and endorsed him. Only former Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> continued his challenge, but there was near unanimous agreement within the party that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> will be a sure winner when the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> votes Feb. 10. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman who had supported one of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s rivals, said there was `` no doubt'' in his mind that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> would win. To overcome the perception that the incoming chairman is too liberal, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> must `` establish his independence from any groups and find us a candidate in four years who will appeal to the broad base of the electorate.'' Opponents of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer-lobbyist, who will be the first black politician to hold the top party post, cited his ties to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> as evidence he would give ammunition to those trying to paint the Democrats as too liberal. `` What does it take to help us win?'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> asked rhetorically. `` It does n't have anything to do with the ideology of the chairman. -LRB- That is -RRB- a totally irrelevant consideration. `` We have fallen into a trap of allowing our enemies, our opponents or adversaries to define us. I think it's time for us to define ourselves and let the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people know what it means to be a Democrat.'' He said the party must do a better job defining its positions on national security, crime and drugs. `` We've got to get out of the box of having some people in this country believe that we are the party that blames <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for everything that's wrong in the world,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. He said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be the principal shaper of the party message and that he hoped to participate in leadership discussions on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> described himself as `` one of the several messengers that have the ability and skills to be a strong advocate.'' He rejected the advice of many party activists that he must take some symbolic action to demonstrate his independence. `` I do n't believe that,'' he said. `` I've passed the test. I've been judged to be a fair and reasonable and common sense person That's why it looks like we're going to have a celebration here in February instead of a fight.'' At the same time, he said, `` I am very sensitive to concerns that people have raised about perception.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he would travel to the South soon `` and go to some statehouses and meet with governors and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders to demonstrate that I want to reach out.'' In the closing weeks of the campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> agreed to become convention manager for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and some party activists are concerned about the perception that he is a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> partisan, a perception he says is incorrect. When asked whether he felt he must do something to demonstrate independence from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> replied: `` We've got to stop treating <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> like some kind of irrational being. He's a reasonable, rational political figure, political leader.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> continued: `` I think he understands full well there might be times the next four years where we disagree on something; where by the nature of my position and my role and the nature of his position and his role, it just makes sense that we'd be on different sides and I do n't know that's going to be such a traumatic thing.''

<HEAD>Russian Factory Ship Snaps up Herring Scorned by United States</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GLOUCESTER, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Soviet factory ship stationed two miles off the coast has been a boon to local fishermen who find herring plentiful but buyers scarce. Americans, they say, turn their noses up at the stuff, but the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION> have a taste for it. `` Years ago, every worker went to work with a can of sardines in his lunch box. Our eating habits have changed,'' said <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, company that set up the venture with the Russians. Americans now eat less herring than ever, according to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Hall, who tracks seafood markets for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. In 1936, Americans consumed 1.3 pounds of sardines, or young herring, per person; in 1987, that had fallen to 0.3 pounds per person, he said. Russians, who figure they wo n't fill their processing ship here until April, are the world's biggest herring eaters, followed by the Eastern bloc countries, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The main <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market for the adult fish is pickled herring, a traditional German dish with only a limited following here. Making matters worse, a boom in the herring export market turned to bust. In the mid-1970s, overfishing depleted the herring stock in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s main fishing grounds, and a cheap dollar boosted demand, increasing the price of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> sea herring to $ 150 per ton. Then the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> herring population rebounded, the dollar rose in the early 1980s, and the price of herring plunged to about $ 100 per ton. Canners and processors from <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> closed their doors. `` So what's happening is, the herring stock is growing like mad, but there's no one taking the fish,'' said <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>, a fisherman based in <LOCATION> Vinalhaven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> said he is reduced to selling most of his catch for lobster bait, and the rest as food for zoo animals. But lobsters are out of season, and the herring to be caught in January are 9 to 12 inches long _ too big for seals, whales and dolphins, <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> said. Alley sailed his 42-foot Night Owl to <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION> last week, and has already sold 400 tons of herring to the Russian factory ship Sovetsk for $ 95 a ton. `` It means keeping busy,'' <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> said. `` It means making ends meet a lot easier.'' About four boats from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and two from <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION> are fishing each night, weather permitting, and pumping their catch directly into the 330-foot factory ship, <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> said. With a crew of 91 men and three women, the Sovetsk can process and freeze about 80 tons of herring a day. It will also buy 500 tons of frozen herring from <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION>'s two remaining processing plants, providing an outlet for trawlers that snare herring while dragging for more profitable species, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> McKiernan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION>, which approved the Soviet ship's visit. The total 4,500-ton haul will be worth about $ 600,000 to local fishermen and processing plants, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. The Soviets are paying in dollars. `` I do n't accept rubles,'' he said. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> has permitted two previous excursions by Soviet factory ships to process under-fished species. The Sovetsk's visit was approved by Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in November after state marine biologists determined that its 4,000-ton catch would not deplete the herring stock, <PERSON> McKiernan </PERSON> said. Next summer, an East German ship will be allowed to take 3,500 tons. Relations between the fishermen and the Russian crew have been friendly, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Palino </PERSON>, a fisherman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, who was invited into the Sovetsk's captain's cabin for a chat, through an interpreter, and a glass of vodka. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said he is trying to obtain visas for the ship's crew so they can have shore leave in February. He said there is little fear of defections. `` The Poles jump ship like rats, but the Russians, it's a good berth for them,'' he said. `` They get paid well, and they get to see the world. ... I'm trying to arrange for them to come ashore to shop at the malls and be capitalists for a day.''

<HEAD>Walesa: Committed To Agreement In Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A buoyant <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> predicted Saturday that authorities will legalize Solidarity next month and that the union will play a key role in helping the government solve <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic problems `` I'm convinced <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> needs understanding and first of all agreement. We are committed to agreement. We must seek agreement ... to get the situation under control,'' the Solidarity leader said at a news conference. Solidarity officials and top government leaders on Friday set a Feb. 6 date for long-awaited, broad-based talks on the future of the banned union and reforms to combat <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic and political crisis. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Solidarity's aim is to deal with the government, not usurp it. `` I said it in 1981 and I repeat it now. We do n't want to take over power. We ca n't. It would be fatal. But we have a deal to make with this government.'' He also said the talks, known as `` the round table,'' could help open the way for other groups that, like Solidarity, do not have <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> approval, to participate in trade union, economic and political activities. `` Today, I'm thinking about our chances, and when I see we are breaking the monopoly, I'm convinced we have great chances,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. The talks appear to be part of a government attempt to bring the opposition into the battle against <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic decline, which has led to chronic shortages, a massive foreign debt and an apathetic populace. The government first proposed the talks in August during a wave of strikes that marked <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst labor unrest since Solidarity was crushed in the martial law crackdown of 1981. The government banned Solidarity in October 1982, and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> refused to agree to talks until it reinstated the trade union. In a dramatic reversal of policy last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> offered to legalize Solidarity if the union agreed to obey the law and, among other conditions, stop accepting financial aid from the West. Last Sunday, Solidarity's leaderhship agreed to negotiations on the offer. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said the talks should be kept as short as possible. `` As far as the round table goes, we have said many times and repeat it, we want to make it as fast as possible. The tentative time is six weeks,'' he said. `` But there are terribly difficult and complicated problems and they ca n't be solved that quickly.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he envisioned Solidarity becoming a strong trade union with good relations with the government. `` We can not say there will be no problems and no accusations,'' he said. `` They will be there, and we can only say we will do everything to minimize them ... We are not seeking conflicts. `` We have to build <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. We will not solve problems with strikes.'' In the past the authorities have accused Solidarity of acting as a political movement, but <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he was interested only in developing `` a good trade union.'' `` It's impossible to be a good trade union in our present conditions,'' he said. `` We must have economic, legal and political conditions to be a good union.''

 A man was sentenced to 30 years in prison early Saturday after being convicted of aggravated kidnapping in the abduction and gang rape of a woman who was forced to testify under threat of jail. <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Chew </PERSON>, 29, was the second to be tried and convicted out of 10 men indicted after the 19-year-old woman reported being abducted the night of March 26 and later raped by as many as 20 men. The first was sentenced to 20 years. District Attorney <PERSON> Heriberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> asked the jury to deny probation, saying: `` Would you let your daughter go out with him knowing that? Would you let your sister? Would you invite him over to your house tomorrow?'' Chew showed little reaction when the guilty verdict was read shortly before midnight Friday, after 5 -LCB- hours of deliberation, nor when the jury returned with the 30-year prison sentence and $ 6,000 fine about 3 a.m. Saturday. Court-appointed defense attorney <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> called the punishment excessive, and said he expects the verdict to prompt plea bargains from the remaining eight defendants, all of whom have pleaded innocent to charges ranging from sexual assault to kidnapping to aggravated kidnapping. `` This is a judgment that for me is hard to digest,'' <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> told the jurors while asking them to grant probation. `` I am far more than an advocate. I firmly believe in his innocence.'' He said the victim voluntarily got into Chew's car with Chew and three other men on March 26, and offered herself to multiple sex partners at a ranch where men had gathered for an illegal cockfight. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said she fabricated the kidnapping and rape story out of fear of her jealous husband. `` She got herself into a situation that she could not explain to her husband, a very rough situation,'' <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. `` She took on a lot of men.'' The woman testified that <PERSON> Chew </PERSON> forced her to perform oral sex, helped restrain her and held a light on her while other men raped her on the hood of a car, and that he caught her when she tried to escape. Two witnesses _ including a 12-year-old boy _ said they saw Chew holding her down. One man said he saw Chew sexually violate her with a beer bottle. The woman had asked not to testify Tuesday, saying publicity from the case disrupted her personal life, but she took the stand after the judge threatened to jail her for contempt of court. On Wednesday, she was taken from the courthouse to a hospital, but returned to testify Thursday. Since the attack, the woman has moved away from this city of about 5,200, located in brush country about 85 miles from the Mexican border, and has been separated from her husband since October. An affidavit from the victim outlined her reasons for not wanting to testify. She wanted to dismiss the kidnapping case, contending that to testify again would be too much to endure. Defense attorney <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> unsuccessfully sought a mistrial after learning that the affidavit, discussed outside the jury's presence, had been taken into the jury room. He said he expects Chew to appeal. In September, <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, 24, the first to be tried in the case, was convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to 20 years. Chew also was indicted on a sexual assault charge, and faces an additional charge for an alleged escape from the <LOCATION> Duval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Soviet planes today flew in emergency food and fuel to the embattled capital, and more countries considered joining the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in closing their embassies before the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> pulls out. The planes flew the emergency supplies to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport, and convoys of at least 112 trucks hauled the food and fuel to silos and gasoline stations, where long lines began forming at dawn. Some of the fuel trucks headed up the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway, the only land route open from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The 250-mile highway passes through territory controlled by Moslem guerrillas who have been fighting the Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government the past decade. In <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, a Moslem guerrilla leader charged today that warplanes from Soviet bases have been bombing dozens of villages in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, causing hundreds of casualties. <PERSON> Burhanuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON>, chief of a rebel faction known as <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION>, said the planes attacked targets that included villages along the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway. He said the raids on the northern provinces of <LOCATION> Takhar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghlan </LOCATION> were made by warplanes flying from bases inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He said other areas were hit by bombers from the Soviets' huge <LOCATION> Bagram </LOCATION> airbase close to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. He called for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to intervene in an effort to halt the attacks. `` The bombing has been very severe for the last three days, leaving hundreds of casualties, and destroying dozens of villages,'' he told a news conference through an interpreter. Western diplomats reported Thursday that Soviets and the elite Afghan Special Guard bombed and shelled villages on both ends of the highway's <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tunnel </LOCATION> on Jan. 23. They quoted eyewitnesses as saying that hundreds of civilians were killed in those attacks. Shortages have eased since the Soviet food airlift began last week. But Afghans, many wearing only light cotton clothing and sandals in the freezing weather, waited stoically in lines for bread and gasoline. The latest airlift came a day after several more non-Communist nations decided to close their embassies in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The first country to close its mission was <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> a week ago, but when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> announced Thursday that it would soon withdraw its diplomats, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> followed suit. Italian diplomats said their government was considering similar action, and non-Western diplomats said <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> allies would probably leave as soon as the Soviet troop withdrawal is completed. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> also had decided to close its mission in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Workers erected steel girders around the Iranian Embassy today, but there was no immediate word whether <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> planned to close its diplomatic mission. About 2 million Afghan refugees live in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which shelters and supports some of the guerrilla groups fighting the Afghan government. Another 3 million Afghan refugees live in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where a separate alliance of U.S.-supported guerrilla groups is headquartered. The Soviets have said they intend to keep their embassy open, but it will operate with about 100 staff members _ one-third of what it was before the withdrawal entered its final stage. Two Soviet military transport planes left <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> today with Soviet families. Helicopter gunships escorted the planes over the hills ringing <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport. The planes dropped flares, which are designed to deflect heat-seeking missiles fired by anti-government guerrillas. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said its last embassy staff members would leave <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in a few days. Dependents and all but 11 diplomats and security guards already have departed. In October, the embassy had a staff of 21 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. A non-Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to close the embassy `` all a part of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s maneuvering, trying to show to the world that this government is on the verge of collapse.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has predicted that President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government will fall from power soon after the Soviet withdrawal is completed. Moslem guerrillas, who get support from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, have vowed to keep fighting until <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> is removed. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government denounced the decisions to close embassies, claiming it could provide necessary security even after the Soviets leave. Under an agreement sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is to complete the withdrawal of its troops by Feb. 15, ending the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s military intervention that started in December 1979 to prop up its client regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. An estimated 115,000 Soviet troopers were here when the withdrawal began May 15 and the last 50,000 are to be gone by Feb. 15. They leave behind a conscript Afghan army plagued by desertion. Diplomats say the army has been driven to dragging teen-agers from their homes and pressing them into service.

 Space workers paid silent tribute today to the seven astronauts who died in the Challenger explosion three years ago. Flags at the Kennedy Space Center were lowered to half-staff at 11:38 a.m., the moment the space shuttle Challenger lifted off launch pad 39B on Jan. 28, 1986. For 73 seconds, the length of the fatal flight, all activity stopped as workers remembered the worst disaster in the history of space exploration. Only about 1,000 of the center's 17,000 employees were at work because of the weekend. Hundreds of visitors touring the space center also joined in the tribute. Most workers were on duty Friday, and they paused briefly to honor the Challenger crew a day before the anniversary. `` We wo n't forget the sacrifice made by these seven fallen heroes,'' <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, told the workers in a brief televised message. `` We promised them we'd push on in the years to come, to fly the space shuttle again, to continue the exploration of space as they wanted us to,'' he said. `` We're fulfilling that promise.'' Meanwhile, peace activists were gathering at a public park for a demonstration this afternoon at the space center. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, the organizer, said the group will rally outside a center gate to protest the launch of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> payloads aboard the shuttle. Discovery, which made the first post-Challenger flight last September, is being readied to return to orbit in late February, the first of seven flights planned in 1989. The target date is Feb. 23, but preparations are behind schedule and officials expect a postponement of at least two or three days. The launch could be pushed into March or later if engineers do n't learn soon why cracks developed in a main engine turbopump during Atlantis' liftoff in December Until the problem is resolved, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> will not clear Discovery for launch. Shuttle managers were to assess the problem over the weekend.

Syrian troops in charge of security in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem sector enforced a truce. A car bomb in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> of eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> wounded a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> soldier and five Lebanese civilians, said a police spokesman. The bomb-laden car exploded this morning near the town of <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> <PERSON> Elias </PERSON>. Victims were hospitalized in nearby <LOCATION> Zahleh </LOCATION> city, 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the police spokesman said. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported 50 casualties in the blast but gave no breakdown. Police denied that casualty figure. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. In a separate attack, a bomb at the entrance to a building in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> exploded later today, wounding six people, a police spokesman said. The victims were rushed to a nearby hospital, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity. No other details were immediately available. The car bombing was the second in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. One on Jan. 13 killed seven people and wounded 15 in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Bir el-Abed suburb. Twenty such explosions last year killed 116 people and wounded 448 by police count. The new casualties in the militia fighting increased the toll to 173 killed and 340 wounded since the latest round of inter-Shiite fighting broke out in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Dec. 31 and spread to south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported that Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> to resume talks on the inter-Shiite power struggle that has dragged on for nine months. The agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> as saying he hoped this time to `` establish a comprehensive accord between the groups with the cooperation of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and political and religious personalities in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> earlier in the week held several meetings with his Syrian counterpart, <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sharaa </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. But no settlement was reached. Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> are vying to dominate the 1 million Shiites who are <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s largest single sect. Clashes in April, May and November last year killed more than 500 people and wounded 1,500. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> wants to establish an Islamic republic patterned after <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s revolution. The more secular <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> resents <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s influence and wants a coalition government, including the Christians who traditionally have dominated Lebanese politics. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has about 40,000 troops in the Moslem sector of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and in the eastern and northern provinces. It is seeking to end the country's nearly 14-year-old civil war.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Said To Be Preparing Big Assault</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rebels are preparing assaults on major military targets following the government's rejection of their offer to participate in elections, according to official and guerrilla sources. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new administration, meanwhile, is trying to persuade <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> leaders to soften their negative response to the revolutionaries. The Marxist-led insurgents, who condemned and did all they could to frustrate five national elections since 1980, offered Tuesday to take part in this year's presidential balloting under certain conditions. `` We have made a proposal. To the degree that the other side does not respond positively, the masses see that the struggle must continue ... The tendency toward violence is increasing,'' guerrilla commander <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Guadalupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The proposal has caused intense debate in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which has given more than $ 3 billion in aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The country is the most favored recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> this decade. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said Wednesday of the guerrilla document: `` This is not a proposal for peace. It is a proposal for war.'' It was `` plagued with unconstitutionalities,'' he said, foremost among them the guerrillas' demand that he postpone the elections from March 19 to September to allow for reforms and their participation. He also cited `` threats to aggravate the conflict'' if the proposal were rejected. `` We are preparing for a very strong military reaction,'' a high-ranking army officer told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He said military intelligence believes the rebels in the next two weeks will hit at least one important strategic target, probably in the capital. The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the elections proposal enhanced an image of rebel willingness to pursue peace. That also is the consensus among diplomats. Even government officials grudgingly admit it. But <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s government considers the guerrilla document tactical and insincere. `` A pretense to intensify violence,'' was how the official Sisal news agency described it. Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, in interviews taped in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and broadcast in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, indicated the rebels had little hope their proposal would be accepted by the incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> or the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. The alliance, known as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, controls the legislature and leads presidential polls. The leftist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convergence </ORGANIZATION> is a distant third. Arena leaders rejected the rebel proposal out of hand as `` a trap'' and `` a siren's song.'' The guerrillas said they would back the Convergence in an election. In the past, rebels denounced elections as a `` U.S.-imposed counterinsurgency plan.'' A source close to the guerrillas said the proposal is legitimate, but that it also is designed `` to underscore contradictions. It shows the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> for what they are, that they are more interested in power than democracy and peace.'' Major rebel attacks are imminent, he said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> on Thursday sought to play down <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s rejection of key elements of the proposal. In comments to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reporters, he emphasized <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s positive assessment of the rebels' recognition of electoral legitimacy. `` Any proposal such as this is worthy of serious and substantive consideration,'' said <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>. A Western diplomat in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is trying soften <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s emphatic rejection. `` It's hard to convince the American <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and people that there's a serious government and business class here when in less than 24 hours they come out with a flat-out ` no' to a significant proposal,'' he said. A labor and farmworkers' union linked to the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> called Thursday for a plebiscite on the plan. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>, the Convergence presidential candidate, told a news conference Thursday, `` I ask myself what the mothers of the tens of thousands of soldiers and guerrillas think of the government's rejection of a proposal that could be an important step toward peace.'' Two radio stations on Thursday asked listeners to air their views on the insurgent proposals. They fielded calls from 158 people. Eighty in the informal and unscientific survey expressed support for the rebel proposal, while 78 said it should be rejected.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The ghost of a man deposed three times by the military is riding the campaign trail as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s opposition tries again to defeat Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and bring civilian rule to this country. `` It is going to be the people against the military,'' said <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, 52, who is running for president under the banner of a coalition formed in memory of the late <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON>. The elections are scheduled for May 7. The government candidate, to be selected shortly, will be backed by the resources of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military. In traditional Panamanian fashion, the <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> legacy is claimed by several political factions, anti- and pro-government. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> died in August at age 86, and his burial brought forth the largest public demonstration ever of loyalty to a Panamanian politician. Some of the opposition's leaders have been expelled from the country, and the <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> coalition is counting on <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' popularity and the appeal of his widow, <PERSON> Mireya </PERSON>, for a strong showing in the elections. Politicians and others interviewed last week by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said a ticket led by <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> collaborator, is not the best strategy for victory. But they hope to turn the elections into a referendum on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. On the ticket as candidates for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s two vice presidential posts are <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> of the small but well-organized <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do not have any illusion about the elections, but they will be another chance for the people to show their rejection of the military regime,'' said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Valencia </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Industrialists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the Civic Crusade, an organization of civic and independent business groups. The military closed the offices of the Industrialists' Association seven months ago News media favorable to the opposition were closed early last year. Opposition leaders say privately they do not expect <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to surrender power if his supporters lose the elections. But they hope `` a political event will happen that will bring us closer to democracy,'' said one politician, who requested anonymity. `` Maybe they will postpone the elections or <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will be overthrown by other military.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has survived more than a year of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attempts to overthrow him, including an indictment on federal drug-related charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and sanctions that have battered <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy. He broke a general strike, crushed public demonstrations and presented himself in this country and abroad as a defender of Panamanian sovereignty. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants him out to make it easier for it to renege on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties, which call for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces to leave in the year 2000. He has been in command since 1983 and could run for president as a civilian. But it is believed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will back a civilian from the government's <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Since taking over, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has deposed three presidents; he installed the current president, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, in February last year. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was in charge in 1984 when, in the first presidential election in 16 years, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> lost a close election tainted by charges of fraud. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> was overthrown by the military in 1941 after one year in power, in 1948 after almost two years and in 1968 after 11 days. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and his group were expelled from <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>'s Authentic Panamanian Party by another faction that now is expected to field its own opposition candidate. `` They -LRB- the opposition -RRB- will be divided again,'' said <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Altamirano </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, editor of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estrella </ORGANIZATION> and a government party congressman. The government is confident it will win the elections, he said.

 More than 4,000 miners died in 1988, the worst year for mine disasters in communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s history, an official newspaper said Saturday. Quoting from the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily said fatalities doubled from 1987, when about 2,200 people died in mine accidents.

The newspaper said that in November alone at least 477 miners died in accidents, and 65 percent of the accidents were caused by gas explosions. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is the world's largest producer of coal, but only half the nation's coal mines are mechanized. Most accidents occur in the small operations run privately or by rural collectives that ignore safety regulations or can not afford to implement them.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was well-liked by many fellow death row inmates, but some believed that his death might paradoxically be a good thing for them, two of <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s former inmate neighbors say. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> McCray </PERSON>, who has been on death row for 14 years, said some <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> State Prison inmates expressed hope that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s death last Tuesday would satisfy a public desire for executions and cause support for the death penalty to recede. `` I think over the years with the ` Kill <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>' syndrome, I think what has developed on death row is sort of a belief that if <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> were dead, then a great number of us would have a chance to live because of society's misconceptions that we were a death row of <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundys </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> McCray </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> for an article published Saturday. Another inmate once housed next to <LOCATION> Bundy </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, said there were varied opinions about <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s fate. `` A lot of people did n't like him. A lot of people thought he was all right,'' said <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, who has been on death row since October 1987. `` Really, when it comes to sex crimes _ toward women and children _ it's not looked good upon by other inmates.'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, 42, was executed for the February 1978 murder of 12-year-old <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He was also sentenced to death for two other murders in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and authorities say he confessed in his last week to more than 20 murders in other states. In all, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> is a suspect in more than 100 murders and disappearances. Both <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCray </PERSON> said they liked <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> and enjoyed living in cells next to him. <PERSON> McCray </PERSON> said he lived next to <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> for about two years. <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> said he was housed next to Bundy for six months. <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, 37, said he and <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> would play handball together in the prison exercise yard, and <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> always was respectful to <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>'s relatives when they came to visit Although the inmates never discussed <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s cases with him, <PERSON> McCray </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> said they were surprised to hear him confess to being a killer during an interview taped shortly before his execution. By that time, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> had been moved to another area of the prison. `` I find it hard to believe _ it's not the same <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> said. `` Even when he started confessing to all these things, I could n't believe it.'' <PERSON> McCray </PERSON>, 39, who was sentenced for the rape and murder of a 64-year-old woman in 1973, said he would talk into the early hours of the morning with <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> and found him to be witty and bright rather than the killer he confessed to be in his final days. `` The Ted Bundy I knew here at FSP -LRB- <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> -RRB- for 11 years was not that person that committed those crimes,'' <PERSON> McCray </PERSON> said. `` I never viewed <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> as a seething psychopath.'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, who once attended law school and worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, was sometimes harassed verbally by other inmates, many of whom are black and poor, <PERSON> McCray </PERSON> said. `` Black men viewed <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> as being a disciple of the system, the very system which we are fighting, because he had grown up with all of the advantages,'' <PERSON> McCray </PERSON> said. `` Therefore, a grotesque form of resentment occurred.''

 The jury in the <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> murder trial reviewed testimony about the fatal beating of his 6-year-old daughter and gave indications that deliberations could stretch into a second week. On Friday, the jury asked to review testimony that could help them judge whether <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s former live-in companion, was physically capable of causing the injuries that killed <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. It was the sixth note from the jury since it began deliberations around midday Monday. The jury retired at 8 p.m. Friday and resumed deliberations at 11:40 a.m. today. Indications were that the jury was far from a verdict. On Thursday, the sequestered jurors asked the judge to allow relatives to bring them changes of clothing for several days. On Friday, several jurors inquired about weekend religious services. Others told employers that they might not be at work on Monday. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, a disbarred lawyer, was charged with murder for allegedly fatally beating <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, whom he illegally adopted from an unwed mother. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was removed comatose from <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> apartment Nov. 2, 1987, and died of a brain injury three days later. The defense claims the girl was beaten by Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46. Prosecutors responded that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, who testified against <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> and was not charged, was herself too badly battered and emotionally disabled to have beaten the child. The case has focused national attention on the duty and ability of neighbors, teachers and social workers to recognize and report evidence of child abuse.

 <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> held a `` cordial'' two-day meeting on the fate of 547 Americans still listed as missing in action in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy official said Saturday. <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Isom </PERSON>, charge d'affaires of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, declined to disclose details in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. The meeting ended Friday, she said. Earlier, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> state radio said the two sides would discuss their first annual plan to resolve the MIA issue and the provision of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian aid to the Southeast Asian nation. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over the past two years has provided more food and medical aid to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> government has significantly increased cooperation in searching for the missing, allowing several joint searches of wartime crash sites. Those efforts were criticized Friday by former <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendon </PERSON>, who said `` everything the government has tried has not for one reason or another succeeded'' in bringing out <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> prisoners he believes still are alive in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>. A total of 2,383 Americans are listed as MIA from wars in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hendon </PERSON>, of <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, is traveling this weekend to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> boundary with <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> to continue publicizing a $ 2.5 million reward offered by 21 congressmen to any Indochinese who returns a POW to American custody `` The word is getting in there. We are doing our best to find an honorable solution to a very difficult situation,'' he told reporters. `` Tons of intelligence'' indicated that live Americans still are held in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>, but excavating crash sites was not the way to go about extricating them, said <PERSON> Hendon </PERSON>, who heads the private POW Publicity Fund. <PERSON> Hendon </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` very close'' in 1983 to getting POWs back, following a mission authorized by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> during which he helped bring $ 225,000 worth of medicine to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> in exchange for live Americans. The mission failed, <PERSON> Hendon </PERSON> claimed, because public exposures of clandestine activities in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> forced the administration to abort such dealings around the world. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has criticized private groups' illegal forays into <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> in search of POWs. Before the talks, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the meetings would involve scheduling surveys and excavations following a January agreement to establish `` a year-round POW-MIA work plan.''

 Followers of political cult leader <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> say they will hold a round-the-clock vigil near the White House until he is released from federal prison. Government lawyers say that wo n't happen for at least five years. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, 66, a three-time presidential fringe candidate, was sentenced Friday to 15 years for scheming to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and deliberately failing to repay loans from his political supporters. Evidence showed <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s fund-raising activities produced more than $ 30 million and that he failed to repay $ 294,000 in such loans. He could have received a maximum of 65 years in prison and fines totaling $ 3.25 million for his conviction on 13 counts of tax and mail fraud and conspiracy. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> says <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> will serve a minimum of five years in a yet-undecided prison before he is eligible for parole. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and six associates were transferred in handcuffs from <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to the city jail in this <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb before being assigned permanently to a federal prison. The six associates received lesser penalties, ranging from three to five years' imprisonment and fines of $ 6,000 to $ 11,000, for their roles in the fund-raising scheme. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was convicted by a federal trial jury Dec. 16 on all 13 counts of an indictment charging him with tax and mail fraud conspiracy. It was his first criminal conviction in a long and controversial political career. While Chief U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was imposing sentences Friday, government prosecutors dropped all charges in a related case in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> against <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, six aides and five political organizations. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's office in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> said that case, involving allegations that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential campaign raised more than $ 2 million through credit card and loan fraud, was being abandoned because of the successful prosecution in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Odin </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said all seven defendants are appealing. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> denied their request Friday to be released on bail pending the outcome of their appeals. Before his sentencing, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> told the judge that `` in effect I was consigned to hell'' because he had rejected a deal offered by high-level figures in `` the Anglo-American liberal establishment'' with an implicit promise of lenient treatment in court. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> did not say what the alleged deal involved, but said it underscored his belief that government prosecutors were seeking to `` eliminate me from the political scene.'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> snapped that claims of political motivation behind the case were `` arrant nonsense.'' But <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> said it was `` time for this evil and reckless prosecution to be brought to a halt before further damage is done'' to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national security interests. The judge said he was bothered that none of the defendants had conceded wrongdoing or expressed remorse over the millions of dollars in defaulted loans they took from <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> supporters, many of them elderly retirees whose life savings were lost. One of the seven defendants, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> legal coordinator <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Spannaus </PERSON>, said that `` remorse should be felt by those who perverted our judicial system for political purposes and trampled on the Constitution.'' <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON> said a small group of demonstrators had begun a nonstop vigil in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, across <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue from the White House, with a large, illuminated sign reading `` Pardon LaRouche.'' She said the sign will be within President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s view from the White House. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Friday, about a dozen <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> supporters held a protest march in front of the Monument of Independence, also known as the angel. They carried signs that read `` LaRouche is Innocent.''

 At one end of the exhibit hall, the video image of former CBS News President <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sauter </PERSON> soundlessly hawks `` Hotline,'' a glittery new game show that home viewers can play by telephone. At the other end, 72-year-old retired <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> butcher <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Maturo </PERSON> makes Bloody Marys for passersby while his son tries to sell their 60-second show, `` Your Minute Message on Meat.'' What both booths at the annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION> have in common is few buyers. They sat next to <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> and had their pictures taken, but most station representatives had already committed themselves to syndication hits such as King World's `` Wheel of Fortune'' or <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Geraldo!'' and had little space on their schedules for anything new. The annual <ORGANIZATION> NATPE </ORGANIZATION> convention, a syndicated television bazaar, typically features more tackiness than trading. But this year's convention reflected a downturn in an industry battling cable and video alternatives Still, the exhibit floor of the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> provided a sensory overload of lights, glamour and glitter. There were celebrities, showgirls, life-size cartoon characters and live animals, including a giant albino python helping pitch a program called `` Monty's Traveling Reptile Show.'' `` This is a shopping mall from hell,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, the former `` CBS Sunday Morning'' media critic here on assignment for <ORGANIZATION> GQ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>. Despite the state of the industry, <ORGANIZATION> NATPE </ORGANIZATION> had more than 7,300 participants, down only slightly from the 7,500 of last year. `` It was not a good year for both the buyer and seller. But what did happen here, it's a chance to get together and cry in each other's beer, so to speak,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NATPE </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Corvo </PERSON>. `` I would say it's somewhat more subdued in the last year or two,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> @ <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which was offering `` Hotline,'' the game show produced by <PERSON> Sauter </PERSON>'s company. `` Cable is taking a big bite out of ... broadcasting. Video is taking a big bite out of ... everybody, so that it is somewhat subdued. But it's a business with a lot of money involved and a lot of people are going for it in whatever means available to them _ glitzy booths, glitzy presentations. ... Last year, with ` Group One Medical,' we did a cholesterol test, and it was a knockout.'' `` Group One Medical'' was one of a wave of `` reality-based'' shows offered last year that did not make it through the season. `` The talk on the floor is that buyers are very apprehensive this year because last year they got burned by ` USA Today,''' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sams </PERSON>, co-executive producer of `` Rollergames,'' one of the few new shows drawing any interest this year. Last year's convention was abuzz over <ORGANIZATION> GTG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 40 million seeming sure thing, `` USA Today: The Television Show,'' a daily newsmagazine. But the critics rejected it, and the ratings were disappointing. Many stations have dropped or moved the show. Reality shows continued to be the order of the day. The only new genre seemed to be so-called `` crash TV,'' prompted by the success of syndicated wrestling shows. `` American Gladiators'' at least offered a peek at its stars, male and female athletes who will take on competitors in a series of `` trash-sport'' events. `` Rollergames'' had only a brief video clip and a slick brochure that promised a combination of Roller Derby and <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>. The pitch seemed to be working. <PERSON> Sams </PERSON> said his sales had climbed from 57 percent of the country before the convention to about 75 percent. `` It's all about hitting a nerve,'' he said. `` It's all about capturing attention.'' <PERSON> Corvo </PERSON> predicted that syndication will suffer another down year but rebound in 1990-91 when contracts are up and stations are looking to replace programming. Over at the `` Your Minute Message on Meat'' booth, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Maturo </PERSON>'s meat-buying tips played incessantly on a monitor in the background while son <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> tried to sell the spots _ and gave thanks they were n't next to this year's cholesterol-test `` We've been getting a lot of traffic,'' <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Maturo </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think it's been a wasted trip. Trying to get into the larger markets is tough. These people have to be sold.''

 Officials suspended municipal voting today at scores of polling places around the country during an outbreak in political violence that killed six people and injured about 200, authorities said. Authorities had deployed 15,000 police and village guards to protect polling stations in today's vote for 80 municipal councils, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The officials said the mobilization came in response to campaign violence that had already killed one person and injured 200 late this week. A police official in <ORGANIZATION> Daka </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at least five persons were killed and about 200 injured in today's clashes involving police and rival candidates for some of the 80 town councils. Another police officer in the southern town of <LOCATION> Mongla </LOCATION> said clashes between groups of rival supporters left another person dead. Polling was suspended in scores of centers because of violence and voting irregularities, said an election officer also speaking on condition of anonymity. The officer said he did not know the precise number of polling stations where voting was called off. Election officials could not give the voter turnout, but more than 2 million people were eligible to vote for the 80 councils. Voting in six towns was postponed by the election <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> because of disputes over voting procedures and boundaries. Campaign marches and rallies were banned Friday night in accordance with election tradition. Election commission sources said 388 candidates were running as chairmen of the 80 councils and 3,000 others were contesting the remaining 798 council seats. The councils serve three years, said <PERSON> Abdus </PERSON> <PERSON> Salam </PERSON>, the election commission secretary.

<HEAD>U.S. Experts Criticize Germany For Lax Chemical Weapons Controls</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense experts lashed out at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Saturday, accusing the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> leadership of `` benign neglect'' of chemical weapons controls and a cavalier attitude toward its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> responsibilities. The charges came during an annual conference for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> military strategists. The meeting opened with a cautious speech by Defense Minister <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> in which he gave only a hesitant endorsement to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plans to extend the range of some European-based nuclear missiles. <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> was attempting to straddle the fence between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position that short-range missile `` modernization'' is necessary to protect long-standing <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense strategies and the broadly held view among West Germans that missile replacement is unnecessary because of improving East-West relations. But his choice of a middle road was criticized by opponents and supporters of modernization and was followed by harsh criticism of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s behavior in a scandal involving a suspected Libyan chemical weapons plant. American charges that West German companies helped build the plant in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> have created serious tensions between the two <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> partners. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., criticized <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> and the government for `` turning a blind eye'' to indications which he said have long linked West German companies to efforts by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> to produce chemical weapons `` I know the West German government is denying what went on in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and the foreign minister is claiming to be shocked,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> told the gathering of 171 defense experts. `` But it seems increasingly apparent that the West German government has been denying what it has long known to be the truth.'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> cast doubt on Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>'s claim that he knew nothing of the alleged West German role in the Libyan plant until November and declared: `` We can not tolerate benign neglect. West Germans were visibly stung by <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>'s words, uniting across party lines to deflect the criticism. <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON>, arms control expert for the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said he was `` firmly convinced'' <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> was doing its utmost to investigate claims of wrongdoing by West German companies. <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> denied he or other Cabinet members had ignored warnings. A month ago, <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> became embroiled in a major political controversy in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> for saying modernization was probably inevitable. He put himself in for further criticism on Saturday by making only one oblique reference to the issue in his speech, stating that short-range nuclear missiles `` must be kept modern.'' The 1983 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> decision to refit existing short-range nuclear missiles to extend their range beyond the limit of 300 miles is increasingly unpopular among Europeans who believe that could block further arms control progress. The opening day of the weekend conference churned up a debate on the missile replacement proposal and other points of contention among the 16 nations of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Discussion was entirely dominated by the U.S.-West German differences, with speeches by the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> largely ignored. <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> gave American critics an opening by claiming an imbalance within the alliance that exposes <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other central Europeans to greater risk than the North American member nations. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Dregger </PERSON>, parliamentary leader of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told the Americans that alliance burdens are `` not just a matter of dollars.'' <PERSON> Dregger </PERSON> and Social Democrat <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Voigt </PERSON> lamented the burdens of hosting <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> missiles and maneuvers, including low-flying fighter jet practices which have led to numerous accidents in their densely populated country. The complaints prompted accusations from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> participants that Europeans have not been pulling their financial weight. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Luttwak </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> told the gathering that `` in the last 20 years other people have been living inside the house of strategic security without paying the rent.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>, accused <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> of wanting `` to have it both ways,'' in being skeptical of Soviet disarmament overtures but sensitive to public opinion that the Kremlin under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> poses less of a threat to the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> devotes up to 60 percent of its defense budget to NATO-related defense and said the huge federal deficit facing the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration mandates a more equitable spread of the expense. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary-designate, took no part in the discussion. He was scheduled to speak Sunday. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, warned that `` rapidly changing views of the German people'' pose a serious threat to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and called on the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> leadership to `` address this problem.'' He referred to recent polls showing that most West Germans sense no serious threat from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, and 80 percent support for removal of all nuclear weapons from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The annual <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> conference, known as the Wehrkunde, brings together military experts from all <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries for discussions on strategy. This year's topic is `` Alliances in a Changing World.''

<HEAD>Impact on Health Programs Seen in Row Over Abortion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Plans to place staunch pro-lifers in top posts at the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> could have deep impact on family planning, fetal research and other key programs, say activists on the abortion issue. `` Just about any abortion issue that has to do with the medical delivery system will touch HHS in some fashion,'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said last week following an agreement to ensure strong pro-life representation in the department's top echelons. The agreement from the administration came in response to concern among pro-life lawmakers that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominee for <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> secretary, Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, could be lacking in anti-abortion fervor. `` There's no office aside from the presidency that's more influential in advancing the right-to-life agenda,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, an fervent advocate of outlawing abortion. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Vin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., struck a deal last week with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>: They would agree to <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s nomination and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would fill other top slots at the agency with pro-lifers White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> later announced that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> had recommended <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, as <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> undersecretary. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, was <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s choice fpr assistant secretary for health, a position that oversees the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, among other agencies. Both are well known as foes of abortion, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. Administration sources also said <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, a former spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has been recommended for assistant secretary for public affairs. All three would be in positions to make and influence policy. While <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> defines the broad outlines, its dictates on complex health issues usually leave the department with ample room to maneuver in enforcing the law and making rules and regulations. The system puts considerable power in the hands of department officials. Concern among activists over the key positions is sharper than usual because the <ORGANIZATION> Surpreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> recently agreed to hear a case that could narrow the legalization of abortion it decreed in the landmark 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, himself, was stung last week when one lawmaker quoted the prospective secretary as saying he opposed overturning the Roe vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> ruling. A Capitol Hill flareup ensued, but <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> quickly quelled the turmoil by meeting with with anti-abortion lawmakers and assured them he supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pro-life position. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s nomination already had raised concerns of anti-abortion activists earlier when he was quoted in a newspaper article as saying he opposed abortion and he favored a woman's right to choose. Later, he said he supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s view that abortion should be allowed only in cases of rape, incest and danger to the life of the mother. Pro-choice forces say that even in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, with ties to the anti-abortion movement, there have usually been at least some restraints. <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasper </PERSON>, an abortion foe, was fired as deputy assistant secretary for population affairs in 1987 when she tried to block federal funds for Planned Parenthood family planning programs on grounds the organization also advocates abortion. `` That shows the possibilities and the limitations,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Broff </PERSON>, legislative and political director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. `` It shows that people at that level have a fair amount -LRB- of power -RRB- to do good or do harm, because the secretary ca n't make every decision. But it also shows there can be some limits on what they can get away with.'' Those family planning grants are still an important issue at HHS. After the <PERSON> Gasper </PERSON> firing, the department rewrote the guidelines for the $ 138 million in grants to deny funding to programs that include abortion counseling and referral in their services. Three lawsuits have been filed challenging the regulations. Two federal courts have ruled against the regulations, one has ruled in favor and appeals have been filed in all three cases. Abortions are covered by the Medicaid program, the federal-state insurance program for the poor that is administered by <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION>, only if the life of the mother is in danger _ a relatively rare occurence. In fiscal year 1988, federal Medicaid funds covered 84 abortions, at a cost of $ 61,235, <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> said. An estimated 1.5 million legal abortions are performed each year. Abortion foes say that though <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has restricted Medicaid funding of abortions for the past 10 years, <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> administrators have some discretion in deciding whether to allow coverage in their case-by-case reviews.

<TEXT>
 They may not rank with <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> and the Sundance Kid, but authorities say they've uncovered perhaps the youngest group of train robbers _ a ring involving 42 children between the ages of 9 and 18. <LOCATION> Gadsden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials said Friday they had identified the children and six adults from the Panhandle community of Chattahoochee accused of robbing idle boxcars of everything from hog livers to car tires. `` The thefts mainly took place after school and during vacations,'' said Deputy <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hindman </PERSON>. `` Once the adults showed the kids what to do, it became easy for them.'' Only five or six people had been arrested by Saturday, said Maj. A.J. <PERSON> Pickels </PERSON>, a spokesman for the county sheriff's department. <PERSON> Pickels </PERSON> said the ring had been in operation since September and was responsible for an undetermined amount of stolen merchandise. `` What you've got is a few adults who were ringleaders and they were using the young people, and they were reaping plenty of benefits,'' <PERSON> Pickels </PERSON> said. Jewelry, clothes, cases of designer tennis shoes, leather hats, car tires, beer, wine, fruit juices, 130 cases of sardines, cases of frozen pork chops and at least 150 pounds of hog livers were stolen, he said. `` It's unbelievable,'' <PERSON> Pickels </PERSON> said. `` I think they were just using it for their personal use, giving it to their friends or selling it to their friends.'' <PERSON> Hindman </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Gadsden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that cases of beer were sold for $ 4 or $ 5 and wine went for as little as $ 1 a gallon. Children told authorities they burglarized boxcars parked on sidings while workers repaired tracks betwen <LOCATION> Chattahoochee </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON>, police said. Authorities are n't sure how widespread the thefts have been since it takes railroad officials several weeks to learn if shipments have reached their destinations intact. `` We'll probably bring it to a head next week sometime,'' said <PERSON> Pickels </PERSON>, who predicted there could be more people involved than the ones already identified.

 The foreign minister has written to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> proposing the two men confer on how to prevent <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> from producing chemical weapons, the ministry said Saturday. News of the letter comes amid <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accusations that West German leaders looked the other way while German companies helped <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> build a chemical plant allegedly capable of producing poison gas. West German leaders deny they ignored American charges that German firms were involved in the Libyan plant and point out that prosecutors are investigating a number of companies believed linked to the complex. The letter from minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> appeared to be part of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s efforts to persuade <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials this country is seriously concerned that German companies may have broken export laws with shipments to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and other countries. In his letter to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> proposed `` joint discussions over measures for the prevention of chemical weapons production in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>,'' the West German <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in a telex to the news media. The statement did not explain what measures those would entail. But the <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said Saturday that Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> plans `` an act of solidarity with Western industrial nations to make sure that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> does not receive missing construction components and materials necessary for the production of chemical weapons.'' `` <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> is making efforts in talks with the allies for such a joint initiative,'' <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> said. Former Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said before leaving office last week that the Libyan plant had not reached the point of production and that it might not get there if Western companies heeded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warnings. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> claims the plant is intended for the production of pharmaceuticals, and not poison gases. <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> said it got its information from `` sources in the chancellor's office.'' The newspaper telexed copies of its report to other news organizations in advance of Sunday's publication. According to the West German <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> telex, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> also has urged that the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> launch `` a joint initiative ... with the goal of preventing the spread of chemical weapons.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s export controls have come under increasing attack in the past few weeks because of the Libyan scandal, reports of West German help in building a suspected mustard gas plant in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, and alleged shipments of materials that can be used to make atomic bombs to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

 Despite attempts by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to stop the violence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, two bombs exploded Saturday and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> Moslem militias battled once again.

In a separate attack, a bomb exploded at a building in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> near a Syrian army checkpoint, wounding six people, police said. A 90-minute firefight between the pro-Syrian Amal militia and the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, in the slums of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> killed one person and wounded three, according to police. In an unprecedented incident at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, local staff locked Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> in his office for three hours on Friday to press for higher salaries, an embassy source said Saturday. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said Lebanese guards had mounted a `` work action'' but refused to give details. `` The issues are economic and are being dealt with,'' she said. A police spokesman, who can not be named under standing rules, said a Syrian army ambulance took the wounded <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> soldier from the site of the car bomb explosion to a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> field clinic in the Bekaa valley. He described the wounded Lebanese as `` civilians.'' Ambulances, their sirens wailing, evacuated the wounded Lebanese to a hospital in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> valley town of <LOCATION> Zahleh </LOCATION> where they were treated for `` minor wounds and discharged,'' the spokesman said. He said the car-bombing, the second in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year, also set ablaze eight parked cars and damaged 12 stores. The first car-bombing occurred in the south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> slum of <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abed </LOCATION> on Jan. 13, killing seven people and wounded 15. By police count, 116 people were killed and 448 wounded in 20 car bombings in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1988. The police spokesman said Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militiamen traded machine gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades until 7:30 a.m., when the Syrian command dispatched patrols to the contested region to impose a cease-fire. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, maintains 40,000 troops in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> and the northern province as well as in west and south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The latest casualties raised the overall toll to 173 killed and 340 wounded since a new round of <ORGANIZATION> Amal-Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighting broke out in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Dec. 31 and spread to south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s apple province. Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> are vying for dominance of the 1 million Shiites, the largest sect in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, made up of <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> zealots, seeks to found an Islamic republic in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> patterned after <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s regime in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> The more secular Amal, Arabic for hope, favors a multisect government that would give Moslems and Christians an equal share of power. By police count, 500 people were killed and 1,500 wounded in three previous major confrontations between Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> since April. The fighting continues despite a concerted effort by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> to set and enforce cease-fires in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The American embassy source, who insisted on not being identified further, said the ambassador was freed Friday night and promised to take up the local employees' demands with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He said the employees demanded `` increases in salaries and were protesting the lack of benefits for their families.'' During the protest, staff members _ including guards armed with rifles _ blocked entrances to the embassy compound in the Christian suburb of <LOCATION> Aukur </LOCATION>, the source said. It was not known how many of the 500-strong local staff joined the protest. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, 49, took up his post Sept. 24 after the previous ambassador, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, left because of illness. The situation at the embassy was normal Saturday, the source added.

<HEAD>Amish Man Jailed For Refusing Son's Cancer Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELIZABETHTOWN, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A member of a small Amish community who refuses to turn his 6-year-old son over to a hospital for cancer treatment has been jailed on a contempt of court charge. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Mast </PERSON> argued that chemotherapy was not helping his son, <PERSON> Amos </PERSON>, who has abdominal cancer, and that the boy has done much better on `` natural medicine,'' such as herbs and vitamins, that he learned at a clinic in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mast </LOCATION>, who lives 15 miles from <LOCATION> Elizabethtown </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hardin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, was jailed Friday after a closed hearing before District Judge <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. `` This is not only his decision, it's the decision of the whole group,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, a court-appointed attorney for Mast. `` Religion permeates everything they do. They believe they are better off to trust God then to get back in the chemotherapy, which they feel would affect the remaining quality of this child's life.'' The Amish religion teaches separation from the world, with plain dress and living, and little reliance on modern conveniences. `` We try to do without what we think we can get along without,'' said <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Troyer </PERSON>, one of the community's three preachers. `` We do things like chemotherapy if we do n't find anything better, but we think we have.'' <PERSON> Troyer </PERSON> said the chemotherapy was like a poison and made the boy worse. Since beginning the natural medication, <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> is looking better, <PERSON> Troyer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mast </PERSON> declined to comment. <PERSON> Mast </PERSON>'s only requests at the jail were to be allowed to keep his family Bible with him and to be put in a cell by himself, both of which were honored, said Jailer <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>. `` The man was very calm very polite, very well-mannered.'' The child's physician at <LOCATION> Kosair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> believes the boy is in danger without a medically proven treatment and filed the petition in <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> juvenile court seeking to resume therapy in December. The hospital contacted the county attorney's office again this month because the child had never returned At a previous hearing, <PERSON> Mast </PERSON> produced an X-ray that he said shows his son's tumor had shrunk as a result of the natural treatment. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said the only way Mast could be released now is if the boy is produced or the case is decided otherwise _ if the boy dies, for example. But the lawyer said <PERSON> Mast </PERSON> has told him he does not know where the boy is and will not produce his son. Mast is part of a conclave of 15 Amish families who moved from <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> to southern <LOCATION> Hardin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> three years ago. German is spoken in the community and homes lack electricity and running water. The children attend a one-room Amish school. State officials say the family has hidden the boy and believe he is in another Amish community. They said he would be taken into state custody if he is found, and the chemotherapy treatments resumed. However, friends and relatives who accompanied <PERSON> Mast </PERSON> to the hearing said the boy would not be turned over. <PERSON> Mast </PERSON>'s father-in-law, <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, said he believes his grandson is being helped by the natural treatment, but that if the boy is n't going to recover he should be able to die in peace rather than pain. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said he was not angered by the court ruling. `` Scripture says if they strike your right cheek, you offer your left,'' he said as he climbed into his buggy. <PERSON> Mast </PERSON>'s wife gave birth to a son Wednesday and did not accompany her husband to the hearing. Assistant County Attorney <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> declined to comment on the case because it involves a juvenile. All records on juvenile cases are also closed to the public.

 A man whose mother hid a note in her underwear saying that her son killed her before she was found dead two years ago has pleaded innocent to a new indictment charging him. `` There's no doubt he's depressed,'' <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dziubak </PERSON>'s attorney, said after court Friday `` Would n't you be having to face charges again when you know you have n't done anything?'' <PERSON> Dziubak </PERSON>, 36, originally pleaded guilty to manslaughter after he admitted pushing his mother, <PERSON> May </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Speiser </PERSON>, 65, during an argument at the top of the basement stairs in their home in February 1987. But experts later differed on whether it was the fall, or a subsequent drug overdose, that actually killed the woman. <PERSON> Dziubak </PERSON> said that after she fell down the stairs, she rejected his offers of help and walked up two floors to her bedroom. She was found dead in bed the next day, having left a note stating, `` <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> killed me threw me down basement.'' Following his guilty plea, <PERSON> Dziubak </PERSON> was sentenced in June 1987 to an 81-month prison term. <LOCATION> Ramsey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Markert </PERSON> released <PERSON> Dziubak </PERSON> in November 1988 and allowed him to withdraw his plea because of the experts' conflicting views on what had actually killed the woman.

On Friday, <PERSON> Markert </PERSON> let <PERSON> Dziubak </PERSON> remain free without bond because the defendant had not fled the state after being released from prison, had no record of violence and had a job. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said he will file a motion to dismiss the indictment for lack of probable cause, and <PERSON> Markert </PERSON> set a hearing date of March 1.

<HEAD>Senior Communist Calls 1956 Revolution A Popular Uprising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a startling contradiction of the official view of history, a Politburo member said on Saturday that the 1956 Hungarian Revolution was a popular uprising, not a counterrevolution. <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> became the first Hungarian leader to publicly contradict the official view that the revolution, which was suppressed by Soviet tanks, was a foreign-instigated counterrevolution designed to subvert the communist system. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, who heads a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> panel investigating <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s postwar history, made his announcement in a radio interview. His portrayal of the revolution as a popular uprising could signal the government's readiness to rehabilitate the men who led the upheaval. Premier <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, Defense Minister Pal <PERSON> Maleter </PERSON> and other top men in the short-lived revolutionary government were executed in 1958 and buried in unmarked graves. In another development, <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, another reformer and father of the 1968 economic reform, was quoted as saying he and other top officials favor a center-left coalition to govern <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> after the 1991 parliamentary elections. <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, who is also on the Politburo and in the government of Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON>, made the statement in an interview carried in the latest issue of the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> news magazine <ORGANIZATION> Profil </ORGANIZATION> to be published Monday. The comments by <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> underscored once again <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s current pioneering role in political and economic reforms in the Soviet bloc. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, speaking on Hungarian radio in the 1968 Hours news magazine, made clear his comments reflect the fact-finding work of the party's committee carrying out an inquiry into the Hungarian history of the past 40 years. But he refrained from commenting on the Soviet role in crushing the revolution, which led to heavy losses of life and a mass exodus of Hungarians. The working committe he heads was installed by the party's policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> At a meeting on Friday, the committee said the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> must `` radically, once and for all, break away from all remnants of Stalinism and sincerely reveal the past, this being the only way to lay the groundwork for a purified socialist policy,'' <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> said. He also noted the forthcoming reburial in marked graves of <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and his associates was a humanitarian issue that concerns the families and `` not a rehabilitation as such about which one ought not to prophesy. `` <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> was right on his 1953 program, in the 1954-55 power crisis, though a dispute still exists about his 1956 rule,'' said the official who was made a Politburo member in May 1988 when longtime party chief <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> was ousted. `` But in October 1956 it was a popular uprising against a humiliating oligarchic rule ... a definition that might bring politics, scholarship and public opinion closer together,'' <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> said. He added, `` The term ` counterrevolution' can not stand its ground, it is being revised ... a rethinking in under way, while the international background is being looked into.'' After the 1948-49 communist takeover in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> declared, `` bearings were lost, a series of crises ensued, failures occurred and ` the dictatorship of the proletariat' simply excluded the workers' participation in handling their affairs following the nationalization drive.'' <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> said the `` workers' councils'' set up by the 1956 insurgents `` gave workers the sense of acting again.'' In the future, the party must `` learn to live together with other parties, proceeding in coalition with them or having them in opposition,'' he said, referring to a party law to be submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> by Aug. 1, 1989. <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, a respected economist and himself a onetime Social Democrat, expressed similar views in the Profil interview he gave after a meeting a week ago with <ORGANIZATION> Austrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> was asked whether his ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> should form a coalition government with the recently revived <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, while the <ORGANIZATION> Smallholders </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, another re-emerging group, remains in opposition. He replied, `` That would be conceivable, but we strive at present for a broad coalition, one in which also the Smallholders' Party plays a role as a positive center, that is a coalition of the left and the center.'' This, <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> explained, would not be an all-party government but a majority government since other parties may also come into existence. Under a recently enacted law on association, political groups may be be formed, but their registration and activities will be governed by the party law to be passed later this year.

<TEXT>
 Twenty-six years after the world teetered on the brink of a nuclear holocaust, the Soviets, Cubans and Americans who guided their nations through the Cuban missile crisis still disagree who was to blame. Though they smiled and chatted amiably, there was much finger-pointing during an unprecedented two-day meeting among living officials involved in the crisis, said one participant. `` I am not sure all people have learned all the lessons from the 1962 crisis,'' <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON>, who was special counselor to President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, said in the session at a trade union center in southwest <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Although he did n't name names, <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> said some speakers still were overly concerned with `` national self-interest'' and `` justification,'' blaming everyone but themselves for letting the superpower showdown get out of hand. `` There is plenty of blame to be shared by all countries represented here today,'' said <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON>, now a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer. Among those around the table were former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> and former National Security adviser <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> on the American side. The Soviet side included former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobrynin </PERSON>, former ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dobrynin </PERSON> did not speak in the public session Saturday that ended the meeting. For the first time, Cubans joined their superpower colleagues in discussing the crisis. Their delegation was headed by Politburo member <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Risquet </PERSON>, who proposed another review session be held in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The focus was on October 1962, when the Soviets deployed nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed a naval blockade on the island and demanded and obtained the rockets' removal. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, now a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> history professor, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should have been more open about their intentions. The Soviets have said they sent nuclear missiles to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> because they feared a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of the island. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> never had any such plan and was guilty of `` a deep failure of communication.'' `` It led you to do something we would never even think of,'' placing missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> told the Soviets. The incident showed the danger of excessive secrecy in military matters, he said. `` There are still some who think secrets are their safety. More often than not, it is the other way around.'' In a plea for more openness, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> of a Washington-based research group that obtained declassified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government documents about the Cuban missile crisis, appealed to the Cubans and Soviets to release their files. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archive </ORGANIZATION>, pointed to three trunk-loads of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> documents placed on a nearby table. <PERSON> Risquet </PERSON> said his island had had enough of bullying by the superpowers and wanted opinions of small countries such as his to be respected. <PERSON> Sergo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikoyan </PERSON> _ who was executive secretary to his father, former First Deputy Premier <PERSON> Anastas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikoyan </PERSON> _ said even in disputes involving small countries, the superpowers should know `` it is impossible to assume that a regional conflict will remain regional.'' <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhurkin </PERSON>, who heads a new Soviet institute studying <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said the Cuban missile crisis was unavoidable because of the superpowers' approach to resolving conflicts at the time. But, he said, the threat from both sides has been reduced because both recognize that nuclear weapons are not needed and that the economies of both no longer can sustain an arms race.

 Pakistanis voted Saturday in national and regional elections that are considered the first test of Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s popularity since she was elected in November. No violence or other problems were reported when polls closed, said a duty officer at <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. There was no early estimate of voter turnout, said the officer, who by custom is not named. Results are expected late Saturday or Sunday. Three million of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s 48 million eligible voters were entitled to vote for 13 of the 237 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> seats and seven seats in three of the country's four provincial legislatures. Earlier Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> announced one of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> seats had been won by a member of Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> because it was uncontested Voting took place in districts where candidates in November general elections won more than one seat, or the vote was postponed because a candidate died. The outcome can not dent the position of Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who heads the federal government in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> on the basis of her sizeable majority, bolstered by support from smaller groups and independent lawmakers. At the center of the opposition is <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jatoi </PERSON>, chairman of the nine-party <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s biggest rival is contesting for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> from the rural <LOCATION> Kot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Addu </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s biggest and richest province and the stronghold of <PERSON> Jatoi </PERSON>'s Moslem coalition By-election results will indicate whether the two biggest parties have lost or gained popularity since the general elections.

<TEXT>
 A prosecutor who prayed with <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> says he is quitting the prison ministry program that led him to the serial killer because of the disapproval of his constituents. Hundreds of phone calls and letters from people questioning State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>'s involvement with <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> before last week's execution have reached the prosecutor's <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> office <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said the reaction has turned from negative to `` 90 percent positive,'' but some people are discussing a recall attempt. `` A small percentage of the public is uncomfortable with it,'' said <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, a born-again Christian who exchanged letters with <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> for about two years and has been state attorney for about a month. `` They feel it's somehow inappropriate. `` I think public perception and trust is absolutely essential. I want to keep public confidence in the office.'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> invited <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> to visit after he wrote as part of his prison ministry. While <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was on death row, <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> visited him about 50 times to pray and read the Bible. <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> asked Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> to delay <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s execution last week to give <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> time to confess to dozens of murders he is believed to have committed. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> refused, and <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was electrocuted Tuesday for killing 12-year-old <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Before his death, he confessed to 23 murders. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> has said his client confessed since 1986 to `` two or three dozen'' murders in private talks with his attorneys and psychiatrists. <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, a former criminal defense attorney, discussed his role in <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s case Friday during a meeting of <LOCATION> Volusia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police chiefs. He asked them to explain his role to their officers, saying: `` Please tell your people because I need their support, I need their trust.'' About 100 disgruntled residents pledged to attend a Sunday meeting at the <LOCATION> Ormond </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> home of <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON>, who said that while the gathering is not necessarily a recall attempt, it may come to that. `` We're just going to have a meeting to let people air their feelings,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s Ambassador <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Saturday to investigate rumors that a kidnapped Irish teacher may be freed shortly, but he said he was not hopeful. A pro-Syrian <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper reported without elaboration that efforts to free foreign captives were making progress. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the Syrian capital, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sharaa </PERSON> told reporters Saturday `` there is nothing now'' when asked about a hostage release. He spoke after the arrival of Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> for talks on fighting between rival Shiite Moslem militias in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Asked the same question, <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said: `` I hope all the hostages will be released.'' <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, who is based in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, told reporters at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, `` I am here on behalf of my government to investigate rumors ... about a possible early release of Mr. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>.'' He added: `` I do n't know of any reasons which would make me particularly hopeful.'' <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> is a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> man with dual <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> nationality whose release is also sought by the British government. Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and believed to be held mostly by pro-Iranian groups. <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> said he would meet with diplomats and others who he was not prepared to identify. The left-wing daily <ORGANIZATION> As-Safir </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that `` spiritual and security sources expect positive developments at the level of releasing some foreign captives held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' It added that `` high-level contacts in this regard took place in the past two weeks,'' but it did not elaborate. The Moslem-run <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> radio Friday described reports of an imminent release as `` mere speculation based on rumors.'' Lebanese newspapers recently have published several reports about possible releases of foreign captives. None has proved accurate. As-Safir's report followed speculation in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Wednesday about the imminent release of <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> and of British hostage <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, 38, was kidnapped April 11, 1986 as he walked to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> where he taught English. Six days later, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Barnet </LOCATION>, north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, was kidnapped as he drove to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in the Moslem sector.

<TEXT>
 A state medical board committee found sufficient evidence to warrant revoking the license of a fertility specialist accused of telling women they were pregnant when he knew they were not. A three-physician panel of the board decided at the end of a five-hour informal hearing Friday that Dr. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> violated the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Medical Practices Act. The panel will tell the full board that it believes revocation of <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>'s license may be justified. The final decision would be made after the full 16-member board holds a formal hearing. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, 52, credited with performing the first amniocentesis in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, also was found to have defrauded six women who paid him up to $ 5,000 each for fertility treatments, the panel said. He recently closed his Tysons Corner clinic. Several former patients who went to <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> for fertility problems and testified Friday had tears in their eyes and smiles on their faces at the panel's finding. `` I could n't figure out what I was doing to kill these babies,'' said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON>, who owns a printing business in <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. `` I felt so guilty.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> told her three times that she was pregnant when she was not. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, said the accusations from the witnesses and the nine lawsuits pending against <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> were the complaints of disappointed women who had difficulty conceiving. `` The other side of the coin is that he has treated a lot of patients ... who did get pregnant,'' Ms. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> had no comment. The findings of the informal <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> state hearing Friday will be sent to <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> in writing. He then may surrender his license to avoid further proceedings from the state board. The Board of Medicine charged <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> with injecting several patients with a fertility drug on several occasions and conducting numerous ultrasound examinations, telling them they were pregnant when they were not. The drug causes symptoms that mimic pregnancy, such as weight gain and postive urine tests. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> also faces action from a federal agency. Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filed consumer fraud charges against him, alleging that he told potential patients his hormone-injection treatments had resulted in successful pregnancies for 80 percent of his patients, when in fact no more than 40 percent became pregnant. In all, said <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> treated `` several hundred women'' who lost a total of from $ 400,000 to $ 2 million or more. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> will be seeking a return of some of all of those fees, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said. Much of Friday's testimony concerned <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>'s interpretation of ultrasound tests on his patients, which seek to examine a pregnant woman's growing fetus by the use of ultrasonic waves. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> maintained that he detected an embryonic sac in the ultrasound pictures, indicating pregnancy. However, he later informed the patients that the pregnancy had ended and their bodies had reabsorbed the fetus. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> said he is not currently practicing and that he is reviewing 25 years of work to prepare defense for multiple lawsuits. Some of the patients' complaints were the subject of a `` 60 Minutes'' television segment last month.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has joined the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in an investigation of illegal trading at the nation's two largest commodities exchanges, a newspaper reported Saturday. A squad of 15 <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agents will look for possible income tax fraud, including the skimming of profits and concealment of income, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported. Citing unidentified sources, the newspaper said the agents had joined the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in examining documents obtained by federal subpoenas. One investigator said some subjects of the inquiry face a dilemma in filling out 1988 federal tax returns, the newspaper reported. They must decide whether to record possibly illegal earnings that were documented by undercover operatives who investigated the exchanges, or face charges of income tax evasion, the source told the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> were targeted by a two-year federal investigation in which <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents posed as traders and secretly tape-recorded conversations on the trading floor. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>' office refused again Friday to confirm or deny the investigation was under way. But published reports say some 200 subpoenas to appear before a grand jury have been served on more than 200 prominent brokers, traders and trading firms. Some witnesses are expected to cooperate, broadening the scope of the investigation. Despite the wide-ranging investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and its European partners are moving ahead with plans for a worldwide trading system. <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> _ a project of the <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ would link investors in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> via an all-night electronic system for trading futures and options contracts on currency futures, including the British pound, the West German mark, the Swiss and French francs, Australian and Canadian dollars, and the Japanese yen. Full trading worldwide is expected to begin in 1990, exchange spokesman <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON> said Friday. The system would kick in at 6 p.m. _ after the <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closes at 3:15 p.m. _ and trade electronically with futures markets on other continents until 6 a.m. _ before the exchange reopens at 7:20 a.m., meaning <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading would be conducted nearly 20 hours a day. <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON> labeled `` completely erroneous'' reports that several European financial institutions backed away from the project because of the federal investigation. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> voted Thursday to join the venture. The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the federal agency that regulates the industry, must approve <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> before it can begin operations.

 Fighting between rival political candidates and their supporters forced officials to halt voting at scores of polling stations Saturday after six people were killed and about 200 injured, authorities said. Violence flared despite the deployment of 15,000 police and village guards to protect polling stations where municipal elections were being held. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it ordered the mobilization after one person was killed and 200 injured Thursday in attacks with homemade bombs and clubs. Despite the violence, the campaign was relatively peaceful compared with past campaigns in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. Representatives of the two major opposition parties boycotted last year's parliamentary elections but are contesting these elections. They are <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Khaleda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> sources said 388 candidates were running for chairmanships of the 80 councils and 3,000 others were contesting 798 council seats. The councils serve three years. Election officials could not give the voter turnout, but more than 2 million people were eligible to vote Saturday. A police official in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at least five people were killed and about 200 were injured in clashes Saturday involving police and rival candidates. Another police officer in southern <LOCATION> Mongla </LOCATION> town said fighting among rival supporters left another person dead there. Polling was suspended in scores of centers because of violence and voting irregularities, an election officer said on condition of anonymity. He said he did not know the precise number of polling stations where voting was halted.

 The Rev. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> joined local government officials and well-wishers for the groundbreaking of a national civil rights museum on the site where <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was assassinated. Construction is to begin this week on the $ 8.8 million transformation of the rundown <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Motel </PERSON>. It is scheduled to reopen July 4, 1991, as a museum with exhibits on major civil rights conflicts and a tour of Room 306, where King spent his last night. `` I need not pause to tell you how delighted I am to return to these sacred grounds,'' <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> told a crowd of about 150 on Friday. `` I'm just glad to be here on this occasion because you are speaking so clearly and so profoundly to the South and the whole nation: ` Get your act together.''' While staying at the <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON>, King was shot to death April 4, 1968, on a motel balcony. <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>, who succeeded King as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, thanked supporters of the project for `` building a memorial to the life of my dearest friend.'' <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> D'Army </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, who led the seven-year effort to preserve the motel, called the decision to turn it into a museum a victory over the `` unholy carnage'' that took place there. But a small group of protesters nearby said King would have wanted to help the poor rather than make a museum. Some waived signs such as `` <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, do n't let his dreams die, too.'' `` We feel our taxes could be better spent in some other way that would be similar to Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s believes,'' said a protester, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>. The $ 8.8 million cost of the museum is coming from the state, city and <LOCATION> Shelby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> governments. Part of the motel building will be razed and the wing where King stayed will be the centerpiece of the museum. Opponents have suggested a homeless shelter or health clinic instead. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said he also favors better housing and health care, but that the <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> is needed as a monument to the civil rights struggle. The <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> began attracting visitors within months of the shooting, after the motel's owner turned <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s room into a shrine. A city report in 1980 said 70,000 people visited the site each year on organized tours.

<TEXT>
 The turbulent struggles of a youthful <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON> to develop his artistic style are spotlighted in a new exhibition of the French master's early works, opening Sunday at the National Gallery of Art. Harsh scenes of eroticism and violence appear among the portraits, landscapes and still lifes in 57 paintings and 15 drawings from the least-known period of <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON>'s art, when he abandoned law school and began painting in his 20s. Hardly any hint of <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON>'s future eminence as a major figure in the impressionist and post-impressionist movements, or his prophetic influence on cubism and abstract art, is evident in the exhibition, which will run through April 30. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, wife of the president, was given a private tour of the Cezanne showing and some other exhibits at the gallery on Saturday. The show, organized by the British art historian Sir <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Gowing </PERSON>, debuted at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> last April and traveled to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ its only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> appearance _ from the <LOCATION> Musee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> d'Orsay </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON> scholar <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rewald </PERSON> told reporters at a National Gallery preview that the artist's early works, from the decade of the 1860s, frequently have been dismissed as inferior to the great canvasses of his mature years. But `` the early works can stand on their own feet,'' <PERSON> Rewald </PERSON> said. `` Even if he had died before his final period, we'd treasure him as a great artist.'' `` Whoever you pick as the father of modern art, the first father has to be <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON>,'' said gallery director <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON>, senior curator of paintings at the National Gallery, said the exhibition is `` a portrait of the artist as a young man'' and `` gets us into the head and mind of one of the greatest painters of all time.'' The paintings and drawings were selected from public and private collections in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. To complement the show, the National Gallery is displaying 25 later Cezanne paintings from its own holdings and loans from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and three private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> collections. The paintings in the auxiliary show are serenely contemplative, after the emotional thrashing and self-doubts reflected in some of <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON>'s early works next door, and they lead to another room where <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON> takes his place with the likes of <PERSON> Monet </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Renoir </ORGANIZATION>. Among the later <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON> oils is the National Gallery's `` Bend in the <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>,'' painted in the first decade of the 20th century with pastel planes that are unmistakable precursors of the cubism of <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Braque </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>.

 Fifteen dead sea lions have washed onto beaches in and near here since last weekend but authorities have been unable to determine what killed the marine mammals.

Possible causes of death include drowning in fishermen's gill nets, being shot at sea, attacks by white sharks or viral infections.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in the first week of April, the official Cuban news agency reported Saturday. The visit was announced on Cuban television Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> news agency said in an urgent dispatch monitored in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had planned a three-day visit to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> begining Dec. 9, but canceled at the last minute after the devastating earthquake in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> sent a relief team to the stricken area and said the invitation to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> still was open. There was no immediate announcement in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> about rescheduling the visit, and Soviet sources have said the visit has been postponed indefinitely. Although Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has made no secret of his disdain for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reformist agenda, the Soviet leader's visit was to feature <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>'s grandest reception for a visiting dignitary. At least 500,000 people were expected to line the route of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s motorcade. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s rejection of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reforms, which he said `` reek of capitalism,'' have led to speculation about a rift between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its closest ally in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s economic performance is poor, and the island nation has been a financial drain on the Soviets at a time when the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> is trying to channel resources to domestic needs. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> also is unsympathetic to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s encouragement of more openness of expression. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was widely expected to try to persuade <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> to soften his opposition to the new political thinking in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We are not seeking to worsen our relations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' one Latin American specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> said in December. `` But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is a very persuasive man, and he will try to explain his intentions.'' The source said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has become an embarrassment as well as a financial drain on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> is seen as an exporter of revolution, a position that runs counter to new Soviet thinking. `` We are no longer supporting class wars or socialist revolution in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said the Soviet specialist, who spoke to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on condition of anonymity.

 A Republican fund-raising letter signed by party chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> criticizes a 50 percent congressional pay raise endorsed by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but a spokeswoman says it was all a mistake. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> is `` not opposed'' to the pay raise, according to <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, who blamed the mistake on <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> staffers. She said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> had ordered changes in the letter, including deletion of the two paragraphs of pay raise criticism, but staff members failed to follow the directions. The five-page letter was mailed to prospective contributors, and found its way into the hands of the Democratic leaders. The letter, which appeals for donations and attacks Democratic liberals, went out before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsed the raise last Friday, calling it `` overdue.'' But it apparently was written after former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> formally proposed the large raise in the budget he submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. It also was mailed before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leadership began negotiatons with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leaders last week to allow the raise to become law Feb. 8 without a vote in return for a package of severe restrictions on outside income, including a ban on speaking fees. The letter tells prospective contributors: `` There's also a move afoot to let congressmen enjoy yet another whopping pay raise. In this kind of atmosphere, how can President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hope to keep your taxes low, cut the budget deficit and keep prosperity growing across the land?'' Ms. <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said the letter was written while <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> was still heading the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition team and had not yet been formally inaugurated as <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> chairman. She said it was prepared by <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> staffers under former <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> adding: `` It was a staff error. It was one of those things that slipped. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s new staff requested changes be made before the final version was made out. This particular one was not.'' The White House press office had no comment and referred a reporter to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Rank-and-file lawmakers would have their salaries raised from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000 unless both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> vote to reject the increase. Federal judges and top executive branch political appointees also would receive 50 percent raises. At a news conference on Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` A raise is overdue. There's no question about that. The reform of the honoraria payments for these speeches, I think is very, very good.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s recommendation to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> endorsed the proposal of a presidential commission. Lawmakers, especially Democrats, were surprised that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not reduce the amount, as he could have done under the law. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, reportedly has been upset that he has taken the brunt of public outrage against the size of the raise, even after the two Republican presidents endorsed it and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leadership began negotiating with Democrats on the financial reforms. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said a `` high ranking member'' of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership, whom he would not name, complained to White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> about the letter. `` We were subsequently told that <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> was informed of the president's position on this issue,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` We do n't think any political effort by the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> is going to go any further.'' The House has taken more heat than the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for the raise because <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders do not plan to allow a vote. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will have a vote _ probably meaningless _ that is almost certain to reject the increase. Last week, the bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators reached tentative agreement on the outlines of the reform package, which would include the honoraria ban affecting speeches, appearances and articles; closing a loophole in federal law that has allowed 190 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members to stash away more than $ 39 million in surplus campaign money for their personal use; limits on travel paid for by special interests, and restrictions on non-honoraria income. Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, both D-Calif. have been negotiating the package with two Republican counterparts: GOP Whip <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, R-Calif.

<HEAD>Officers Scouting Central Utah Area For Bundy Burial Sites</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A police officer on Saturday scouted a central <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> site where serial killer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> claimed, before his execution, that he buried one of his victims. However, <ORGANIZATION> Bountiful </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said that, as in the case of two unsuccessful forays Friday at other locations, a full-scale search for the remains of <PERSON> Debi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> would have to wait until warmer weather. In confessions Sunday and early Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> used maps and descriptions to target areas where he buried the bodies of three women killed during the mid-1970s while he studied law at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>. On Friday, searchers seeking the remains of 15-year-old Sue <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> were were frustrated by frozen ground and snow cover southeast of Price. Lawmen in <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> reported similar conditions near <LOCATION> Capital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said he buried the body of 17-year-old <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>. However, temperatures near <LOCATION> Capital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>, in south-central <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, are generally warmer than the other two sites and <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Chief Deputy Leon Brinckerhoff said a search could begin within a week to 10 days if the weather cooperates. `` If weather permits and the snow melts, we want to be right back in that area. If there's a body there, we'll find it,'' he said. Brinckerhoff added that a rancher in the area remembered seeing a man wearing a suit and matching <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s description, in the area in the mid-1970s, but did n't think to contact authorities until he heard of the execution. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said his officer examined a stretch of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 89 between <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON> in hopes of narrowing the scope of a later search for <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>'s remains. `` All we're really doing is checking out the information provided to us by <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> in regard to the location, to see if we can locate approximately the site,'' he said. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> supplied a detailed description of the gravesite, but declined to discuss specifics. `` We're going to have to wait until spring,'' he said. `` But I think that we've got a pretty good chance for success, and we'll make every effort to find <PERSON> Debi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>'s remains. In the days before his execution last Tuesday, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, 42, confessed to 23 killings, but investigators suspect he may have committed more than 100. He has been linked to slayings in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> acknowledged involvement in eight <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> killings and mentioned the names of <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION>, last seen in a high school parking lot on Nov. 8, 1975, and <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>, who vanished from the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Holladay </LOCATION> the previous October. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> also said he abducted a girl from the <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus in 1975 and buried her body near Price, in east-central <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Investigators believe that victim was <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, who disappeared from a Mormon youth conference at <ORGANIZATION> BYU </ORGANIZATION> in June of that year. But while <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> mentioned eight killings in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, authorities have been able to link him through evidence or confessions to only five. Besides Kent, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>, investigators believe <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> also killed <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 17, of <LOCATION> Midvale </LOCATION>, who disappeared Oct. 19, 1974, and <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Aime </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, also 17, who vanished 12 days later. Their bodies were discovered in canyons of the <LOCATION> Wasatch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Range </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>New Premier Calls For ``New Socialism'' In Yugoslavia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s Premier-designate <PERSON> Ante </PERSON> <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> on Saturday called for radical market-oriented reforms and a `` completly new type of socialism'' to overcome the country's deep economic and social crisis. `` I consider the open-market economy to be an ultimate achievement of mankind for which no alternative has yet been found,'' <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> said, advocating closer links with `` the most developed European countries.'' He also revealed that this communist country, with inflation running more than 250 percent and stagnating economic growth, is again unable to repay foreign debts. `` The solution to our problems does not lie in cosmetic changes to the existing system,'' <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> said in his speech on state television. `` We should develop a completely new type of socialism in this country ... with maximum democracy, freedom and political pluralism,'' <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> said in his first public address since he was designated premier by the state presidency. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> said he accepted the premiership on the condition he have a free hand in choosing his Cabinet. He said it will take at least five years to consolidate his reforms. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> is formally to remain in office until the end of <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON>'s original four-year mandate that expires in May 1990. The premier designate said he would need a full mandate to implement his economic plan. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> on March 1 is to succeed <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON>, who resigned with his entire Cabinet on Dec. 30. It was the first federal government to step down since the communists took power after World War II. <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> resigned following his failure to solve the country's numerous social and economic problems, including a dramatic escalation of labor and ethnic unrest `` All 23 million citizens of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> should have a right to decide about -LRB- the future of -RRB- this country ...'' <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> said in a clear reference to the <ORGANIZATION> Yugoslav </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members who occupy all leading economic and political posts. In May 1987, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> was unable to repay an installment of about $ 400 million of a short-term foreign loan. Without giving details, <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is now faced with a similar problem. `` Unless <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is able to increase its foreign currency earnings to between $ 25 billion and $ 28 billion a year within the next five years ... it will not be able to set aside 25 percent of that figure to repay its foreign debt'' and simultaneously ensure that its economy continues to function normally, he disclosed. At present, the country's foreign currency earnings are about $ 11 billion annually. It has to devote about $ 7 billion annually to service and repay its $ 21 billion foreign debt. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> said that joint ventures with foreign partners must have `` absolute priority.'' He also called for an `` urgent introduction of shares and bonds, private initiative and entrepreneurship in the Yugoslav economy'' and an end to state interference in the running of businesses. Other reforms would include the reshaping the banking system along Western lines, creating a capital market and an end to state subsidies for money-losing companies. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> workers in profitable firms should be `` stimulated to work better'' through higher salaries because `` the impoverished worker is ready to destroy the current system.''

<HEAD>Rescuers Suspend Search at Collapsed Peru Gold Mine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rescuers on Saturday suspended their search for about 20 miners buried for a week in a sabotaged Peruvian gold mine, police said. Three miners have been found alive and six bodies have been recovered since a rescue began Monday at the hillside mine near <LOCATION> Nazca </LOCATION>, 230 miles south of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Official sources now say no more than 30 miners were trapped and presumed dead, after giving conflicting figures ranging from 15 to 300. <LOCATION> Nazca </LOCATION> police said they suspended operations because rescuers were endangered by toxic fumes, smoke from a still-burning fire, and feeble tunnel supports that caused several new cave-ins during the week. The government is evaluating whether to renew efforts after 20 rescuers were treated for inhalation of smoke and toxic gas in the past week, said police. Factions battling over a rich gold vein on Jan. 21 set ablaze timbers supporting tunnels and smoke prevented miners from escaping the Sol de Oro mine, officials said. Flames ate through the beams and the mine collapsed Monday, further enclosing victims. Hope was revived briefly Tuesday when rescuers reported tapping from caved-in tunnels. But those sounds have not been heard since. Officials said it is impossible to know exactly how many people were trapped because about 900 farmers and other area residents have been working the mine independently for more than a year, mining when and where they like without any control. Commercial mining was halted there 40 years ago because of falling profits, officials said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Saturday discussed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and then warmed up for an all-male evening of humor by having lunch with a businessmen's club. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, back from a recent trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said leaders there are `` very relaxed'' toward the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, even though the president is calling for a go-slow approach to expanding ties between the two nations. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> shared his impressions of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at their meeting Saturday, he said. He said the Soviets do not see <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to review U.S.-Soviet policy as a bad sign and are not impatient for quick action. `` I think they understand that a review has to be undertaken,'' he said. `` I have the impression that they have great confidence in President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' On his second weekend as president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ventured out of the White House for lunch with members of the <ORGANIZATION> Alibi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> a few blocks away. The club consists of about 50 businessmen and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has long attended its Friday lunches, said press aide <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanca </PERSON>. The event was switched from Friday to Saturday because most members were in town to attend the evening's annual jokefest with the all-male <ORGANIZATION> Alfalfa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Zanca </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has attended the Alfalfa dinner in the past, along with former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and a virtual who's who of administration officials, business leaders and congressmen of both parties. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who in his campaign pledged to be an advocate for women's rights, planned to attend in `` the tradition of past presidents,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to attend the all-male <ORGANIZATION> Alfalfa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> was criticized by <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a women's activist and Democratic political consultant. She called the club an example of how women are excluded from chances to make business ties. The 76-year-old club permits no press coverage, but <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in past years has compiled the speeches and ribald jokes as relayed by those on hand. In 1987, members raved about the speech delivered by Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., but Sen. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON>, D-Md., was not <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> had quipped that women would throw their panties at him when he spoke on the campaign trail. The Post quoted him as saying, `` It happened again just yesterday. I do n't know what got into Senator <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON>.'' By the time <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left the Alibi Club on I Street, about 100 people had gathered across the street. He gave a wave and they cheered. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s motorcade kept up a new practice for casual drives of stopping at traffic lights. In the past, the procession has simply swept through while police halted ordinary motorists. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> caused a stir when she left the White House grounds Saturday. Accompanied by about five companians and security personnel, she decided to walk her English springer spaniel, <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>. When she walked out to the front gate onto busy <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, she was chased by reporters and camera crews who had been waiting for <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>. `` I'm going for a walk,'' she said as passersby stopped to stare. `` I'm going to do this all the time.'' She apparently had planned to cross the street to <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where official <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> guests usually stay. Informed that it was closed, she turned and went back into the White House grounds. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also was given a private tour of a National Gallery of Art showing of youthful works by French impressionist master <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON>. The 57 paintings and 15 drawings. The show opens to the public Sunday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Sunday planned to travel to the presidential retreat at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and spend most of the day there. The president was to be visited at Camp David by House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said administration sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. One characterized the meeting as purely social and said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s wife would drive to Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON> with him. Since his election, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made a point of friendly gestures toward <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in anticipation of a brewing storm over the federal budget. The source, however, said no fiscal discussion was planned for the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> visit.

 Those who saw the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> oil spill blacken <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s coast with sticky goo two decades ago still have a residue of bitterness, environmental activism, and mistrust of business and government. `` It looked like the world was covered by oil,'' recalled biology professor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Neushul </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>. `` It was a shock. It was horrible,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> `` Bud'' Bottoms, a sculptor and co-founder of Get Oil Out, better known as GOO. `` Everybody stood along the beaches and cried because we thought our environment was finished.'' GOO scheduled a Saturday night dinner at the <ORGANIZATION> Montecito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> to commemorate the big spill created when an offshore oil well blew out in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> on Jan. 28, 1969. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ named <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> when well A-21 on platform A blew out _ said the accident 5 -LCB- miles south of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> `` was not a pleasant experience for the company.'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> agreed with drilling foes that the accident _ which saw oil-drenched birds and beaches televised nationwide and spurred an eight-year drilling moratorium off <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> _ helped spur the environmental movement. `` It was a social disaster. It was a governmental disaster,'' <PERSON> Neushul </PERSON> said. `` It was an industrial responsibility disaster. It was the beginning of the environmental movement.'' Yet, <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> and its critics still disagree over the amount of oil spilled, the extent of damage and the likelihood that improvements in drilling technology spurred by the spill will prevent another such accident. The spill `` spewed more than 3.25 million gallons of oil over 800 square miles of water, covered 100 miles of coastline and beaches with a thick, tarry black goo, smothered thousands of birds, fish and other sea life, and helped trigger a new age of environmental awareness,'' a <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> news release said last week. Tallies by <PERSON> Neushul </PERSON> and his students concluded the spill killed 9,000 birds, 8.8 million barnacles, 30,000 mussels and 51,800 limpets, but they were unable to prove significant numbers of deaths among fish, whales, elephant seals, sea lions or plankton, he said. `` The truth is that it was not an ecological disaster,'' <PERSON> Neushul </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION>'s best estimate is that 420,000 to 840,000 gallons of oil spilled and 30 miles of coastline were covered with oil. Lawsuits stemming from the spill resulted in settlements totaling about $ 16 million, he added. `` A number of scientific studies make it pretty clear as to what the ecological impact was, and that is nothing,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. Others disagreed. `` If that was not an ecological disaster, there is no such thing as an ecological disaster,'' replied GOO's current president, lawyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopps </PERSON>. When the spill happened despite federal and oil company assurances to the contrary, local residents were furious. `` Government was taken in by the big oil companies, no question about that,'' said former GOO president and ex-state Sen. <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weingand </PERSON>, now 84. `` We do n't trust our government as much as we used to, which is great,'' <PERSON> Neushul </PERSON> said. `` It means they do n't lie to us quite as much.'' But <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said the spill had `` a tremendous impact'' on improving drilling technology to make wells more controllable, led to improved training for oil platform workers and made oil companies averse to taking any risks. <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> district production superintendent <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON> said that since the spill, `` there have been over 900 wells drilled offshore <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and there's not been another incident like this. Somewhere along the line there should be some confidence we can drill without having a disaster.'' Others are less confident. With nearly two dozen oil platforms in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> today, `` We all live in fear and anticipation that one will be hit by a tanker or another blowout,'' Bottoms said. `` It's like having a monster. It is a monster _ a giant oil monster.''

<TEXT>
 Rebels fired rockets into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Saturday as more Soviet soldiers left the country, and a guerrilla leader said warplanes bombed villages and killed hundreds to clear a path for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal. Soviet Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> discussed <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s withdrawal plans with President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and other Afghan officials on Friday and Saturday in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Under a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> accord, the Soviets have until Feb. 15 to end their nine-year intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but diplomats who requested anonymity told The Associated Press the withdrawal should be completed within a week. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which serves as a refuge for more than 1 million Afghans, said its embassy will remain open, and workers on Saturday erected half-inch-thick steel plates around the embassy's eight-foot walls. Other Moslem and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> countries began planning for increased security around their embassies in the besieged capital. `` This is not just a concern of the Western nations,'' said one Moslem diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` We could count on the Soviets for security. Now we have to figure out what we will do when they've gone.'' The Soviets have said they intend to keep their mission open, but <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc allies were considering closing. Most non-communist nations have ordered their diplomats to leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Saturday. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> closed its mission a week ago, the first nation to do so. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> announced Thursday that it would withdraw its diplomats, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> followed suit. At a news conference in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, the Pakistani capital, <PERSON> Burhanuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, accused the Soviets of sending warplanes into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to bomb villages. `` The bombing has been very severe for the last three days, leaving hundreds of casualties, and destroying dozens of villages,'' he said. <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> appealed to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to stop the destruction. Villages along the strategic 260-mile <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, which leads to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> from the Soviet border, were among the targets, <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> said. The road is the main land route for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal. Western diplomats reported Thursday that Soviets and the elite Afghan Special Guard bombed and shelled villages on the northern and southern ends of <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> on Monday. They quoted eyewitnesses as saying that hundreds of civilians were killed in those attacks. The area is dominated by guerrilla commander <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Masood </PERSON>, who belongs to <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON>'s group. The guerrillas, backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, have been fighting the Afghan government since a Marxist coup in 1978. They are not a party to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agreement and are expected to close in on <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government once the Soviet withdrawal is complete. For their part, the guerrillas have continued to rocket <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and other major cities. They fired four rockets into the capital Saturday, said a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official who requested anonymity. He said no one was killed in the shelling. The government's troops fired eight missiles into hills surrounding the city. There were no reports of casualties. Two Soviet military transport planes carrying about 60 passengers each flew out of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Saturday. Helicopter gunships escorted the aircraft over the snow-covered hills and the planes dropped a cascade of flares designed to deflect heat-seeking missiles fired by the guerrillas. Other Soviet transport planes airlifted emergency food and fuel to the embattled city. Convoys tailed by tanks hauled flour to silos and fuel to gasoline stations, where lines as long as a half-mile began forming before dawn. Shortages have eased since the Soviet airlift began last week, but many Afghans, some wearing only light cotton clothing and sandals, waited for hours in freezing weather for bread and gasoline. Many went home without either.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> should arbitrarily set a date for resuming <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> peace talks despite objections from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said Saturday. <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> called on the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials to pressure <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> into returning to the negotiating table. `` The secretary-general and his personal representative are duty-bound now to fix a date for resuming the peace talks at a date which they find appropriate, and they should not allow <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to put any preconditions on resumption of talks,'' <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said, according to the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> comments came at the end of the first day of talks with a team of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials headed by special envoy <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON>, who arrived from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Friday on a mission to revive the stalled negotations. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> delegation, <PERSON> Gianni </PERSON> <PERSON> Picco </PERSON>, would not comment on the content of Saturday's discussions or say whether the face-to-face negotiations would resume soon. `` We are working to make progress in implementing U.N. Resolution 598,'' he said, referring to the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution that outlined a cease-fire and peace treaty in the 8-year gulf war. `` We will leave no stone unturned in trying to achieve that,'' he added. A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in the gulf war took effect Aug. 20 but peace talks that began five days later in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> broke down immediately over the issue of troop withdrawals to prewar borders. Two further rounds of negotiations brought no progress and no date was set for them to resume. Earlier this week, <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON>, held four days of talks in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> with officials there. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has demanded that before the peace talks resume, the two sides should agree to full implementation of Resolution 598, including the troop withdrawals.

 Sinhalese extremists shot and killed a candidate for next month's <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> election, bringing to 10 the number of candidates slain this month, officials said Saturday. <PERSON> Punchibanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratnayake </PERSON> was shot to death Friday night in <LOCATION> Welimadu </LOCATION>, about 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, police said, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Ratnayake </PERSON>, a Sinhalese, was a member of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Sri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. A senior election department official said 10 candidates for the Feb. 15 parliamentary elections have been killed since nominations closed Jan. 6. Police had put the total at 10 before <PERSON> Ratnayake </PERSON> was killed. But the election official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that was incorrect. He said six of the slain candidates belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, two to the leftist <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, one to President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and one to the <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> Tamil <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> party. Seven of the victims were Sinhalese, two were Tamils and one was Moslem. Police blamed the latest killing and most of the others on the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an extremist Sinhalese group. However, they said two Tamil candidates killed in the northern <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION> region were victims of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, a separatist guerrilla group that has been fighting the government since 1983. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> have vowed to disrupt the elections for the 225-seat Parliament. Police said the front has killed more than 60 people, most of them political party supporters, in the last three days. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> have rejected the government's offer of partial autonomy for northern and eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, where most Tamils live. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> are seeking an independent homeland for their ethnic minority. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> started attacking the government and other Sinhalese politicians last year, saying too many concessions were being made to the Tamil minority. Sinhalese make up about 75 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and dominate the government and military. Tamils comprise about 18 percent and say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese. Most Tamils are Hindus, and most Sinhalese are Buddhists. The Moslems, who claim descent from Arab traders, account for about 7 percent of the population. There is also a tiny <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> minority, consisting of descendants of European colonists and converts among the Sinhalese and Tamil communities.

<TEXT>
 Iranian President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> deplored the plight of women in Western society on Saturday and said their real rights are safeguarded only by <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` In stark contrast to the honor and respect accorded to women in Islam, the West has degraded women to the meanest level,'' the news agency quoted <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> as saying. The agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted him as saying that women in the West have been reduced to `` mere objects of pleasure,'' despite alleged strides toward achieving equal rights. The Iranian president was speaking at the opening of a seminar on women held to mark the anniversary of the birth of <PERSON> Fatima </PERSON>, daughter of the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> who founded the Islamic faith. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> criticized the Western `` culture of permissiveness and nudity which gives man a free rein to exploit and insult woman's personality,'' the agency said Despite official claims that under the Islamic regime, Iranian women enjoy more rights than ever, women are still considered second-class citizens in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and are strictly segregated from men in public. One of the first decrees of the Islamic revolution that overthrew the Western-oriented government of the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> 10 years ago was that women should cover themselves from head to foot in public. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, also reduced the legal age for women to marry from 18 to 13 soon after coming to power in 1979. The tradition of `` siqeh,'' a form of legalized prostitution which was frowned on by the <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> and is condoned by the Islamic government, has become common practice in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Permitted by <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, the largest breakaway sect from the orthodox <ORGANIZATION> Sunni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, the practice of `` siqeh'' allows `` a temporary marriage of a night, a week, a month or a year,'' between men and women. Under Islam, a man is also allowed four wives, but a woman is only allowed one husband.

<TEXT>
 Two Nazi war criminals freed after 43 years of imprisonment in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> were indirectly responsible for sending <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> to the death camps, a historian said Saturday. But there is no direct link between the Dutch Jewish girl who died in the <LOCATION> Bergen-Belsen </LOCATION> concentration camp and the two Germans, said <PERSON> Loe </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON>, considered the nation's foremost authority on World War II. <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, 87, and 79-year-old <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> aus der Fuenten were deported to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Friday. The two were high-ranking Nazi officials responsible for sending thousands of Dutch Jews to their deaths during World War II. Only 6,000 of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>' 150,000 Jews survived Nazi persecution. `` The group that arrested the -LRB- Frank -RRB- family in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> operated under the command of aus der Fuenten and aus der <PERSON> Fuenten </PERSON> worked under the instructions of <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` It would be correct to say they had indirect responsibility'' for <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s fate. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> is the author of the 14-volume `` History of the Kingdom of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> in World War II,'' a government-commissioned study. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and her family were arrested by a German police unit known as the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> in August 1944, and were first deported to the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp in Nazi-held <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> later was moved to the <LOCATION> Bergen-Belsen </LOCATION> concentration camp in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where she died of pneumonia in 1945 at age 15. From June 1942 until her arrest, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> wrote her diary as the <PERSON> Franks </PERSON> hid in a secret section of an <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> canal house closed off from the rest of the building by a bookshelf. The book, perhaps the most famous personal document to come out of the Holocaust, was published in 1947 and was turned into a play and movie. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> ran the Hague-based Jewish Section of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- SS -RRB-. In that capacity, `` he gave guidelines ... about which Jews should be rounded up,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> said. Aus der <PERSON> Fuenten </PERSON>, an SS administrator who ran what was cynically called the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION> for Jewish Emigration, oversaw the deportations of thousands of Jews from <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> and The Hague. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> and aus <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuenten </PERSON> were sentenced to death in 1950, but their sentences were commuted to life imprisonment a year later. They were the world's only war criminals who had been jailed since World War II, according to the government, which said keeping them here any longer would violate the principle of equality before the law. The <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> has pardoned and freed 107 other war criminals who had been sentenced to death.

There's a limit to the influence you can exert without money.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy-makers have long found direct foreign aid among the best tools for extending <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> influence abroad and encouraging behavior friendly to American interests. `` Persuasion is good, but there comes a point where you have to discuss programs,'' <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` We are at the very bottom limit. It affects posts abroad, morale, the way other nations look at us.'' On the other hand, foreign aid bills do not enjoy much popularity in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because voters generally are not keen on sending <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tax dollars to other countries. Some of the money goes for economic development and humanitarian aid, some $ 5.2 billion in the current fiscal year. A larger amount, $ 7.7 billion is classified as `` security assistance,'' and includes grants of weaponry. But a severe financial squeeze is on the horizon. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional leaders have promised an array of potentially expensive new domestic programs, from fighting drugs to alleviating homelessness, at a time of severe budget constraints. In the foreign aid area, an increase in the flow of refugees worldwide, new <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces in southern African and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and new commitments to countries like the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains military bases will put other aid programs into the budget vise. It is up to <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>'s committee, its <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> counterpart and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations committees to design programs and policies that will fit into the new down-sized budget, a process that is bound to be painful and strain bipartisanship. One possible avenue is to emphasize punishments, rather than rewards, in seeking to influence other nations' behavior. But there is broad disagreement on how well economic, diplomatic or trade sanctions work. <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON> pointed out the drug problem as an example. Current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law calls for the president to certify annually, and for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to accept, that countries on a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> list of drug-trafficking and producing points are `` fully cooperating'' with anti-drug efforts. Such certifications have been hotly debated in the past, and decertification action _ even if only threatened _ has damaged relations with friendly countries. While pursuing one goal, the drug war, objectives of economic and political stability are lost. <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON> said the certification system may need to be revamped, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may need to assume more of the responsibility for its drug problem. `` We ca n't blame others for our problems,'' he said. `` We're the problem. It is n't them. It is affecting our foreign policy capability. We have to rethink how much of a sanction you can put on another government.'' Among other problems likely to be high on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' foreign affairs agenda this year: _ U.S.-Soviet relations Lawmakers are of two minds: Some worry that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will move too slowly and forfeit opportunities for further arms control progress under the moderate leadership of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>; others fear that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is merely taking a breather before resuming expansionist policies and that he may be seeking to split the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. _ War powers <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will continue their long battle over who has the power to commit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to world hot spots. `` I can almost guarantee you that unless we find an answer ... the hope and desire of both of us to have a bipartisan foreign policy is going to be impossible,'' Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said at a recent confirmation hearing for Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> _ The spread of chemical weapons Several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have vowed to press for legislation that would penalize companies that sell equipment used to produce chemical weapons, and to impose sanctions on governments that use, produce or store poison gases or biological weapons. _ <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> The focus is likely to shift from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, where the new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> team seems to be taking a less confrontational approach toward the leftist Sandinista government, to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, which holds a presidential election in March. The right-wing Arena party, which already controls the country's legislature and in the past has been linked with death-squad activity, is heavily favored to win the presidency. _ <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> It has been a year since ruler <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grand jury on drug charges, but sanctions have apparently not loosened his grip on the country. A 1991 deadline looms for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approval of a native Panamanian commissioner for the canal, complicated by continued bad relations between the two countries. _ Environmental issues A growing group of senators want to put environmental protection on the world agenda, hoping to create multilateral forums to discuss issues like global warming, acid rain and deforestation.

 Mourners at the funeral of a slain anti-apartheid leader on Saturday chased away police who tried to remove a banner bearing the name of an outlawed political group. An estimated 5,000 people attended the funeral of Dr. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Asvat </PERSON>, a physician and a founding member of the <ORGANIZATION> Azanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. He was fatally shot in his medical office Friday in the black township of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. About a dozen white policemen in civilian clothes arrived at the Avalon Cemetery, which is shared by <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> and the Indian township of <LOCATION> Lenasia </LOCATION>, and tried to pull away a banner with the group's name on it from four mourners. Men began chanting in Arabic, `` God is great,'' and descending on the policemen, some of whom pulled their guns. The officers then turned and ran toward their van and drove away. No motive is known for the killing of <PERSON> Asvat </PERSON>, an Indian doctor who ran programs for squatters and homeless people and participated in education and health programs in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. Police and relatives said two black men entered the doctor's offices, one pretending to be a patient and giving a false name They left, returned later with a gun and fired two shots at <LOCATION> Asvat </LOCATION>, killing him immediately, then fled. Leaders of the banned <ORGANIZATION> Azanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which believes blacks should fight for their own political rights without white help, blamed `` agents of the apartheid system'' for <PERSON> Asvat </PERSON>'s death in speeches at the funeral The group is one of more than 30 anti-apartheid groups the government banned in 1988. Meanwhile, a building housing three black trade unions in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, in the eastern <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, was gutted by fire Saturday morning, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported. It was the fourth arson attack in as many months against black trade union offices in the city.

 A hundred Haitian cane cutters were crammed `` like animals'' into a truck driven by a drunken man who drove the vehicle off a cliff, survivors said Saturday. The crash killed 48 people. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Majority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> denounced the brutal treatment of Haitian cane cutters and accused the government of `` practicing slavery.'' Officials said it was the worst traffic accident ever in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which shares the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island of Hispaniola with <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. The truck plunged from a cliff early Friday about 22 miles north of <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION>. Those killed included six children and three women. In an interview published Saturday by the <ORGANIZATION> Santo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Domingo </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Ultima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hora </ORGANIZATION>, one of the Haitian survivors, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, said the Haitians were recruited near the border by a Dominican `` trafficker'' and smuggled to a military barracks in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> border town of <LOCATION> Dajabon </LOCATION>. `` After being kept prisoners for two days, two tall men and two soldiers took us out,'' he told the newspaper. `` We were fed and loaded on a truck ... like animals.'' <PERSON> Ultimo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hora </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> as saying the truck driver told the Haitians if they gave him money to buy rum they `` would not be taken to cut cane but rather would be taken someplace else whre there was better work.'' Police on Saturday were still looking for the driver. Survivors said he had been drinking when he missed a curve shortly after midnight Friday and flung himself from the truck, which rolled down a hill. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers and soldiers found more than 20 bodies trapped under the overturned truck 10 hours after the accident. Others were sprawled around the area. The 36 people injured were being treated at <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION> hospitals. Every year Dominicans recruit about 19,000 poor Haitians at low wages for the tortuous work of cutting sugar cane, the backbone of the country's economy. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> have accused the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> government of practicing slavery with Haitian cane cutters. Before Haitian dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled into exile in 1986, he received more than $ 1 million a year from the Dominicans in exchange for <LOCATION> Haitian </LOCATION> cane cutters, a practice widely condemned by international human rights groups.

 A storm spread up to 23 inches of snow across <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> on Saturday, making driving hazardous and slowing air traffic, and also poured soaking rain across the south-central part of the nation. Temperatures hit record highs around the Great Lakes, while a bitter cold snap continued in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> with an unofficial record Saturday morning low of 86 below zero. <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stapleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> had flight delays running about two hours Saturday morning, said airport operations chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON>. There were `` a lot of fender benders'' for motorists in the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> metro area, according to a dispatcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>. Echo Lake reported 23 inches by midday, while <PERSON> Conifer </PERSON> had 18 inches Saturday morning.

A winter storm warning was issued for the Front Range of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> and at higher elevations west and north of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. The storm, centered over south-central <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, pulled moisture from the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> northward into the central and <LOCATION> southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, and the middle <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Paper Says Government Troops Decimated in Border Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of Angolan government troops was `` decimated'' in early January while setting up a monitoring post in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> near the Namibian border, the <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> newspaper reported Saturday. The weekly Expresso said the troops were attacked while setting up one of the posts designed to monitor an Aug. 8 cease-fire between <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> along the border. The paper said its information was first-hand from <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> but named no sources. Following the attack, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> `` established intense diplomatic contacts'' with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to find out the cause of the incident, but <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> denied its forces were involved, Expresso said. The rebel <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Total </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION> also has not claimed responsibility for the attack in its regular statements issued in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. Angolan officials have accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> of continuing to supply the rebels through the unpatrolled border section. <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> claims the area allows activists of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to slip in and out of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The Angolan rebels have their main <LOCATION> Jamba </LOCATION> base about 19 miles from the Namibian border and claim control of the region. They have warned repeatedly that hostile forces found in the area, including members of a 10-nation, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring force, would be attacked. Angolan military officials have said they would have to send an armed contingent into the unpatrolled area to oust the rebels, but that would allow <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to accuse them of violating the cease-fire agreement. The agreement states there can be no substantial troop movements on either side of the border. Expresso did not say whether the attacked troops formed part of a military operation against the Angolan rebels. Under accords signed Dec. 22 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> pledged to cease aid to the Angolan rebels and to give independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. In return, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> promised to end support to African nationalist activists and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> agreed to withdraw 50,000 troops that supported <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government in its fight against the rebels.

 Industry Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> said Saturday there will be no peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> as long as <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> `` runs around alive'' and that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must do more to counteract the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader's peace initiative. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>'s comments in an interview with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reflected `` a personal opinion that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> should be killed,'' his spokesman, <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Behagon </PERSON>, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` He says many times that if it were possible, he would want to kill him.'' Also Saturday, Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials support his peace plan that includes elections in the occupied territories in exchange for a cease-fire in the Palestinan uprising, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television reported. One Palestinian protester was reported fatally shot in the territories Saturday. Arab news reports said at least 10 people, including a boy, either were shot and wounded or beaten in clashes between soldiers and stone-throwers in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The army confirmed four woundings by plastic bullets. The death raised to 370 the number of Palestinians killed in the nearly 14-month-old uprising. Fifteen Israelis also have died. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>'s remarks come amid growing debate over the nation's policy toward the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s response to the 13-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied `` As long as <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> runs around alive around us, there will never be peace,'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> said. `` No Arab leader will be ready to meet with us for fear for his life. And no Palestinian will be ready to talk because if he does so while <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is alive, his fate is sealed.'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> seemed to be alluding to repeated threats from leaders of the PLO-supported uprising against Palestinians who cooperate with the Israelis. More than a dozen alleged collaborators have been killed during the uprising. Once the nation's defense minister, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> was forced from the post in 1983 after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s militia allies in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> massacred Palestinians in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> denounces the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as terrorists and refuses to talk with it. The nation protested bitterly when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opened talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> last month. But there are growing calls for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to change its policy. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, said he has won support from leading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials for a peace plan he published last week that offers elections in the territories in exchange for a cease-fire in the uprising, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television reported. The plan has been rejected by both the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and underground leaders of the uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. But the television quoted <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> as telling a reporter that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have indicated that the plan was a `` possible basis'' for a settlement to the Palestinian issue. However, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> said: `` Any attempt in or out of the government that tries to explain why we should speak to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, only paves the way for and lends legitimacy to other governments to talk to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> began his latest peace initiative in December when he said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Last week he traveled to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, where he was received for the first time by Western European leaders. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said a 23-year-old died after troops shot him in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. The army confirmed the death but said it was investigating the circumstances and gave no other details. Two other Palestinians were wounded in the same clash in the village of <LOCATION> Sureif </LOCATION>, while two others were wounded in a village near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the army said. Two Palestinian teen-agers from the <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION> refugee camp near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> were also treated for beating injuries to the face, said the reports and an official at <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. At least four other woundings occurred in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports said. The army confirmed three, including that of a 3-year-old boy, from plastic bullets fired at stone-throwing protesters.

<DATELINE>DRUMCLIFF, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Admirers of the great Irish poet and playwright <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> filled <ORGANIZATION> Drumcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday to mark the 50th anniversary of his death and remember his literary legacy. A lone army piper played a lament and a choristers from a local school sang as <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>' son and daughter, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>, joined in the memorial service. On the poet's grave in the churchyard lay a single rose and a wreath from the <ORGANIZATION> Yeats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, bearing the brief inscription `` Memories.'' <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>, a founder of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s renowned Abbey Theater and winner of the 1923 Nobel Prize in literature, died in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Jan. 28, 1939, at the age of 73 and was buried there temporarily. After World War II, his body was returned to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> for burial in a state funeral in 1948 where he wished to be buried _ at <LOCATION> Drumcliff </LOCATION> in the shadow of <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulben </PERSON> mountain by the church where his grandfather had been rector. Archbishop of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Caird </PERSON> told the congregation: `` World acclaim, the Nobel Prize and the offer to have his body buried in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Patrick </LOCATION>'s Cathedral in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> did not prevail against the poet's simple wish to be buried in <LOCATION> Drumcliff </LOCATION> churchyard.

<HEAD>Hungary Likely To Drop ``People's Republic'' From Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government is likely to shed its `` people's republic'' designation and adopt its pre-communist coat of arms, the Hungarian state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported. A parliamentary committee rewriting the constitution is considering the move, as well as including human rights provisions and political reform in the document that will likely be approved by a voter referendum, the news agency said late Friday. Members of the panel said it was `` quite superfluous'' to add epithets such as `` democratic'' or `` socialist'' to the designation `` republic of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'' in a new constitution now being prepared, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s present official name is <PERSON> Magyar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nepkoeztarsasag </PERSON> or Hungarian People's Republic. That name will be changed in the new constitution, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said. Lawyers on the committee argued the constitution, not the designation of the state, should reflect the democratic and socialist system in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the news agency said. Lawmakers also proposed that the first chapter of the constitution should lay down human rights and obligations, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported. Several deputies said a coat of arms, including the St. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>'s crown, which is kept in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, would be the most suitable symbol of statehood, while others favored the Kossuth coat of arms, which does not contain the crown The current Hungarian coat of arms was fashioned after the Soviet model, featuring two sheaves forming a circle. The Kossuth coat of arms was used for a while in the wake of the 1848 uprising against <ORGANIZATION> Hapsburg </ORGANIZATION> rule. Constitutional committee members agreed that the prime minister should in future be elected by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and be obliged to introduce his government to the chamber, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said. They also supported the idea that the president of the republic should have genuine powers but he should not be entitled to dissolve parliament, because a strong presidential system might lead toward a personality cult. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> quoted Justice Minister <PERSON> Kalman </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulcsar </PERSON> as saying that the draft of the constitution would be discussed by various organizations, including alternative groups outside the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in the coming weeks. After going before the party's policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and then parliament on March 8, the text of the constitution will be completed by June 8, presented `` for public debate'' in the second half of the year and again submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in December this year. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> approves the new constitution, it will most probably be subject to a referendum,'' <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Space workers and tourists stood silently Saturday for 73 seconds, the length of the fatal Challenger flight, to remember the seven astronauts who died in the fiery shuttle explosion three years ago. About 350 peace activists marked the anniversary with a rally outside a Kennedy Space Center gate to protest the launch of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> payloads aboard space shuttles. Four women were arrested for trespassing when they deliberately walked into an off-limits area. Tour buses stopped in their tracks, and engineers, technicians and support crews halted activity as flags at the Kennedy Space Center were lowered to half-staff at 11:38 a.m., the moment when Challenger lifted off on Jan. 28, 1986. `` It's an appropriate way to mark the occasion, leaving it to the individuals on how they want to remember it,'' said <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>, the center director. Only about 1,000 of the center's 17,000 employees were at work Saturday, but hundreds of tourists joined them in the tribute. Meanwhile, a Challenger memorial was dedicated Saturday in downtown <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` It was n't until we lost Challenger that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public realized that space travel is dangerous,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, speaking at the Challenger Seven dedication at <LOCATION> Bayfront </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Democrat, rode on a shuttle mission just two weeks before the Challenger disaster. The 105-foot white sculpture, shaped like a twisting girder, was designed by <PERSON> Japanese-American </PERSON> artist <PERSON> Isamu </PERSON> <PERSON> Noguchi </PERSON>, who died in December. On Friday, space workers at the cape paused briefly to honor the Challenger crew a day before the anniversary. <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> said in a televised message: `` We wo n't forget the sacrifice made by these seven fallen heroes. We promised them we'd push on in the years to come, to fly the space shuttle again ... We're fulfilling that promise.'' The peace activist demonstration was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>. Among those participating was former Apollo astronaut <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who walked on the moon in 1971. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told the group that military reconnaissance and navigation satellites have a place in space because they help keep the peace. `` That's not true about putting weapons in space,'' he said, specifically mentioning the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> program whose goal is to deploy an anti-missile system in orbit. Following an afternoon of speeches and songs, the demonstrators had a peaceful confrontation with security guards at a center gate near the headquarters building. After being warned that anyone passing through the gate would be arrested, four women entered. They were booked and given a court appearance date. Organizers had announced before the rally that some planned to trespass as part of the protest. A group of men wearing <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> Klan robes stood by to protest what the demonstrators were advocating. Killed in the Challenger tragedy were <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Scobee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> <PERSON> Onizuka </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>, <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> and schoolteacher <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>. <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said at a ceremony in nearby <LOCATION> Cocoa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> Saturday and it is important to remember the Challenger explosion `` so we will not forget what happened, lessening the chances of it happening again.'' The accident was blamed on a faulty booster rocket joint that allowed flame to escape and touch off the shuttle's external fuel tank. The three remaining shuttles were grounded for 32 months while modifications were made. Discovery made the first post-Challenger flight last September and was followed by Atlantis in December. Discovery is being readied for another flight in late February, although engine turbopump problems could delay that mission.

<HEAD>Report Says Britain To Pull Troops From Gibraltar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A newspaper report that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will withdraw more than half its troops from <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> was described by the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday as `` speculative.'' Early editions of The Sunday Times said the government would pull more than 1,000 troops out of the British colony and shut down many military facilities there. It said the foreign secretary, Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, would announce `` a study to review British defense commitments'' during a visit to <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> on Monday. The paper said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> sources confirmed a decision had been made to withdraw the troops _ more than half the 1,900 British forces based there. A <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Saturday night: `` This report is speculative. Force levels are kept under constant review. When ministers come to a decision on any change we will make an announcement.'' The Sunday Times quoted a <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> source as saying, `` Now that <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> is a member of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, there are insufficient military reasons to maintain such a large presence, which costs a lot of money.'' British control of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> is a highly sensitive issue between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, which claims that the 2.2 square mile colony at the southern tip of the <LOCATION> Iberian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> is rightfully Spanish. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which was ceded <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> in the 1713 Treaty of <LOCATION> Utrecht </LOCATION>, has used it as a base for nearly 300 years, currently for troop training and munition stores as well as for an airport, dockyards and a navy base. The colony's 28,700 inhabitants have made clear they wish <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> to remain British.

 A <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official on Saturday urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to upgrade its talks with the Palestinian group and perhaps move the discussions to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We believe the dialogue must be on a higher level, that is if we wanted to be serious,'' <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> executive committee member, said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, also known by his guerrilla code-name of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazen </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` is trying to upgrade the level of the dialogue and to have it held in other places.'' Asked about alternative venues, he said, `` Such as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that it was `` too soon'' to consider moving U.S.-PLO contacts to a higher level. Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in December assigned the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to open the dialogue. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has its headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. The move ended a 13-year American ban on contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The ban was lifted after <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s explicit recognition in December of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and his renunciation of terrorism. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leadership had asked <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> to fix a date for the next U.S.-Palestinian meeting, which would be the first under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency. He said that when the issue of terrorism came up at the first dialogue session, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> said it was against attacks on `` civilians outside the -LRB- <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> - -RRB- occupied territories ... and against killing civilians inside the occupied territories, the crime committed daily by the Israeli forces against the Palestinian people. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> added: `` But our resistance against the Israeli military occupation will continue and will not be suspended.''

<HEAD>Government Abandons Town After Nine-Month Rebel Onslaught</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Defending government troops ran out of ammunition and abandoned a southern Sudanese town besieged by rebels for more than nine months, the <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION>'s general command said Saturday. The army statement said more than 1,700 army and rebel troops were killed or wounded in the 37-week siege of <LOCATION> Nasir </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> region. The statement said the government troops were forced to withdraw after bad weather stopped airdrops of much-needed ammunition and supplies. Since the siege started, army aircraft have been dropping supplies over the town and bombing rebel camps around it. In <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Lam </PERSON> <PERSON> Akol </PERSON>, said the rebels had captured the strategic town after seven days of intensive fighting and that they were in full control of the garrison town. `` People are now rejoicing and dancing in the streets of the city,'' <PERSON> Akol </PERSON> said. Six other government garrisons fell in recent months. In each case the army explained the loss as a `` tactical withdrawal'' of its forces. <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON> is about 500 miles south of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> and 20 miles from <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, which has aided the rebels with weapons, money and facilities since the uprising began in 1983. <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON>'s loss is a major blow to the beleaguered Sudanese army's war effort Western military sources said late last year that in rebel hands, <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON> would become a springboard for attacks on central and western Upper Nile. The army statement said the Sudanese armed forces `` decided to withdraw its troops from Nasir effective yesterday -LRB- Friday -RRB- after they ran out of ammunition and it became impossible for them to defend the town any further. `` It became totally impossible to supply the town with equipment and men.'' More than 1,000 `` outlaw forces'' _ government jargon for <PERSON> bush </PERSON> fighters of the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> _ were killed or wounded during the siege, the statement said. It put government losses at more than 100 soldiers killed and more than 600 wounded. Army dead included Col. <PERSON> Mahjoub </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON>, commander of the Nasir garrison, `` whose plane crashed last week,'' the statement said without giving details. Neither did it specify whether the plane was shot by rebels. The rebel broadcast from <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> claimed that <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON> was captured when his men fled during the `` one hour of storm attack'' that finally took <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON>. `` <ORGANIZATION> SPLA </ORGANIZATION> forces are now in hot pursuit of the remnants, who fled in disarray in different directions,'' the broadcast said. Renegade army Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> formed the guerrilla army and launched his rebellion against the Moslem-dominated central government in early 1983. Rebel operations cover all southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s three regions of <LOCATION> Equatoria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON> el-Ghazal and Upper Nile, inhabited mostly by Christians and animists. <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> wants economic and administrative reforms in the south.

<HEAD>Turbopump Problem Could Delay Space Shuttle Launch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday it probably will replace at least two of the three liquid oxygen turbopumps on Discovery's main engines, a move that could delay the shuttle's late February launch until March. A decision will be made before Discovery is rolled out to the launch pad, a move scheduled for Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said. `` It is very likely we will pull at least two of the pumps,'' she said. Sources reported that replacing two pumps could mean a delay of 10 or more days in the planned Feb. 23 launch. The problem stems from the December flight of shuttle Atlantis. Post-flight inspection of Atlantis' engines disclosed two tiny cracks in a bearing assembly in one of the turbopumps. Engineers determined they were caused by stress corrosion, apparently resulting from moisture that penetrated the metal during the curing process. Extensive analysis has not revealed the source of the moisture. Because two of Discovery's pumps may have been processed in the same manner as the faulty Atlantis unit, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is leaning toward replacing them with new, carefully inspected pumps. The third pump may be removed as a precaution, Miss <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said. Such engine work usually is done when the shuttle is in the horizontal position in a processing facility. But Discovery was mated last week with its booster rockets and external fuel tank, and the turbopump replacement would have to be done while the craft is in the vertical position. Technicians have been working on new procedures to do the work in that position. Too long a delay in Discovery's launch could affect the subsequent Atlantis mission, which is to dispatch a probe to the planet <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> on April 28. Discovery would have to be off the only shuttle launch pad by about March 14 if <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is to maintain the April date. Discovery is to carry a crew of five astronauts who are to deploy a communications satellite and conduct scientific and medical experiments.

<TEXT>
 For a week, the owners of Pixie, a normally playful puppy, did n't know why she had slowed down and would whine anytime she was picked up. The answer came when a veterinarian removed the 7-inch long, serrated steak knife the dog had somehow swallowed. `` If I had known a knife was in her, I would have freaked,'' said owner <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Strollo </PERSON>. The English bulldog-German shepherd mix was less than 2 months old and weighed just over 10 pounds when she wolfed down the knife, probably on Jan. 14. The knife apparently fell on the floor during a meal and nobody noticed, <PERSON> Strollo </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, said. No one, that is, except <PERSON> Pixie </PERSON>. Teeth marks found later on the knife testify to the fact the puppy gnawed at it before she swallowed it. Dr. <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Helm </PERSON>, a veterinarian, who found and surgically removed the utensil Jan. 21, said the knife lay neatly packaged down <PERSON> Pixie </PERSON>'s throat, with the handle pushing down on the stomach The first signs that something was wrong came when the pup tried to cough something up, but nothing happened. Then Pixie started acted funny. She could n't coordinate her front legs, and she would give a tiny yelp when people picked her up, the <PERSON> Strollos </PERSON> said. A first trip to the vet revealed nothing. X-rays were taken on a return visit and clearly showed the knife. `` Dogs swallow anything ... pantyhose, balls, sticks,'' Ms. Helm said. `` Just like a young human child, a puppy explores with its mouth.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plans to move its headquarters from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. The airline last year moved its principal hub operation from <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. Since the airline was purchased by a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment group last summer, speculation on a location for the company's new headquarters has centered on <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> has a smaller hub. The <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> quoted industry sources it did not name in reporting that <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> officials have decided to move the headquarters staff of 120 to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. `` They'll make the announcement probably sometime in February, then move after school is out,'' one source told the newspaper. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday a final decision has not been made. `` I have no way of knowing why their source said such things,'' <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said, adding no announcement is pending. <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisitions </ORGANIZATION>, an investor group formed by <ORGANIZATION> Paine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Webber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, bought <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> in June for about $ 100 million and became the airline's third owner since its 1982 bankruptcy court reorganization. The new owners immediately began an effort to rejoin the ranks of the nation's largest carriers, pulling <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s primary hub out of <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> because of competition from the giant hub operations of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> there. The airline recently announced the purchase of 50 Airbus A300 planes, a deal valued at $ 3.5 billion that would nearly double its fleet, with an option to buy 50 more. About 1,200 of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s 4,000 employees work in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where the airline has 84 daily departures and is the region's dominant carrier About 1,000 work in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> has 34 daily departures, and another 1,000 in the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> area. The company earlier this month leased more than 26,000 square feet in an abandoned terminal at the <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> airport. But <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> told the Star-Telegram projecting that space as the site of the company's new headquarters is `` reading in things that we've not said.''

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hanged seven more drug smugglers in an anti-narcotics crackdown, bringing to at least 110 the total number of drug-related executions this month, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. Six more drug traffickers were to be hanged before dawn Sunday under a tough new narcotics law that went into effect Jan. 21, the news agency quoted the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Ettelaat </ORGANIZATION> as saying. The seven hangings took place Friday and Saturday in <LOCATION> Torbat-E-Heydariyeh </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Khorasan </LOCATION> province near the Afghan border, said <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. It said authorities seized 163 pounds of opium, 8.8 pounds of heroin along with weapons, ammunition and a pair of military binoculars when they arrested the seven smugglers. The agency said 69 other smugglers were arrested Friday in the <LOCATION> Khorasan </LOCATION> region after local law enforcement authorities cracked four drug rings. In those arrests, authorities seized about 132 pounds of opium, 22 pounds of hashish and 3 pounds of heroin as well as Soviet-made weapons, gold and 11 vehicles, it said. An estimated 1,500 people have been arrested since the crackdown on traffickers began in December. At least 110 have been hanged or shot by firing squads this month. A new law mandating death for anyone found with small amounts of drugs was announced Dec. 5 by the 13-member Expediency Council, a body with special powers set up by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> to speed up legislation in Parliament. The law also provides for a minimum 20-year prison term for anyone convicted of causing drug addiction in another person. Those convicted of causing widespread addiction could also face the death penalty. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said that one million Iranians are believed involved in drug abuse. It said prices of heroin have shot up since the start of the campaign and that pushers were asking addicts to use the drug in front of them to avoid being picked up during <LOCATION> Komiteh </LOCATION> raids.

<HEAD>Thousands Protest Government Labor Package That Allows More Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands supporting a communist-dominated trade union marched through the capital Saturday protesting a labor law package proposed by the center-right government that would permit more layoffs. The estimated 20,000 demonstrators, waving banners and chanting slogans dating from the country's 1974 leftist revolution, filed slowly along downtown <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>'s main boulevard <PERSON> Avenida </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Liberdade </PERSON> and into <PERSON> Rossio </PERSON> central square. They called for an eight-hour reduction in the present 48-hour working week and a 13.5-percent increase in the national minimum salary recently hiked to around $ 200 per month. The General Confederation of Portuguese Workers -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> CGTP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s most powerful union, organized the march and other gatherings across the country against laws they claim would allow employers to hire and fire at will and deprive workers of job security by the spread of temporary contracts. <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> government says the laws are necessary that allow employers to dismiss workers for economic reasons, in order to streamline the work force in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s labor-intensive and state-dominated economy A socialist-inspired constitution adopted after the 1974 revolution currently makes it difficult for employers to dismiss workers. Unions and employers' associations were initially slated to sign an accord on the package Monday but the signing was called off, as neither side could agree to final terms. The Socialist-associated <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- UGT -RRB- had worked out an agreement with the government, but it was later rejected by employers. Both <ORGANIZATION> UGT </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CGTP </ORGANIZATION> unions also object to a wages and prices proposal based on what they see as unrealistic government forecasts on inflation and have threatened a general strike if no acceptable labor package can be found. The government based last year's wage claims on an inflation prediction of around 6 percent. Inflation nearly hit an annualized 10 percent at the end of December. <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> points out <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s growth rate of an estimated 4.2 percent in 1988 is almost double the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> average and a 6 percent unemployment rate is relatively low for EEC standards.

 The leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing said the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> killed an `` exceptional and regrettable'' number of civilians last year But <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, told 600 delegates to the annual party convention that his rebuke did not mean he was condemning the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> and its armed struggle to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, meanwhile, a police officer was killed Saturday and two others injured in a bombing attack near the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> border. And in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, an estimated 2,000 demonstrators marked the 17th anniversary of `` Bloody Sunday,'' when British soldiers fatally shot 14 people during a Roman Catholic civil rights protest in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> supports the mainly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s fight to unite the province with the republic. But even some <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters have criticized the group for blunders that killed at least 20 civilians in the past 14 months. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> earlier this year told the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> to `` get its house in order'' after one of its bombs killed two of his Roman Catholic constituents in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. `` Since the last -LRB- convention -RRB-, there has been an exceptional and regrettable level of civilian casualties and fatalities arising from <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> operations,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said in a keynote speech at <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s Mansion House. `` Our dismay, our regret and our sympathy with the plight of families bereaved by the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is genuine,'' he said. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>'s national executive committee, told the conference the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is trying to resolve the issue. He said the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> dissolved one of its units to punish it after a November bombing in <LOCATION> Enniskillen </LOCATION> in which 11 civilians were killed. Earlier, senior party official <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> may set up pirate radio stations in the province to circumvent a government ban on interviews with its members, news reports said. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> commands about one-third of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> vote in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and won seats on 17 of the country's 26 local authorities in the last elections in 1985. The next local elections are in May. The convention is to end Sunday. In <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, meanwhile, a policeman was killed and two others were injured during a bomb attack in the border village of <LOCATION> Sion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mills </LOCATION> in west <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. A spokesman at police headquarters in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> said the three policemen were driving down the main street of the village when someone standing in the doorway of a pub signaled for them to stop. Not realizing it was an ambush, the policemen halted their car and one got out to investigate. An assailant then threw a bomb at the car from the roof of a nearby building, wrecking the car, police said. One officer died and another was badly hurt in the blast. A third was injured when scores of people spilling out of a nearby nightspot pelted him with bottles as he tried to aid his injured colleagues. The noisy crowd also attacked army and police arriving on the scene but the group was dispersed when reinforcements fired rubber bullets, police said. Police said the march in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> went `` extremely well,'' and four people were arrested for public order offenses. Chief Inspector <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Symons </PERSON> said about 50 supporters of the extreme right-wing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> followed the march but there were no clashes. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said the soldiers opened fire on an illegal march organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> on Jan. 30, 1972, in response to sniper fire. A judicial inquiry concluded that none of the dead or wounded had been proven to have been shot while handling a firearm.

 A smoky fire erupted Saturday in the middle of a landmark nine-story hotel, killing at least three people and injuring 14, officials said. The fire started about 7:15 a.m. in a fifth-floor room at the <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> Hotel, and spread to the hallway and an adjoining room before being extinguished before noon. Floors above suffered smoke damage and the fourth floor suffered water damage, Fire Commissioner <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, who owns the hotel with his wife, <PERSON> Dee </PERSON>, estimated damage in the millions of dollars. Among those staying at the hotel were 20 residents of a nearby apartment building for the elderly that was being renovated. Others were business travelers and music teachers attending a convention. The fire started in the room of <PERSON> Murial </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Croton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` I plugged an iron into the wall socket and there was a flash. The chair caught fire and I tried to beat it out,'' said <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, who was not injured. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said officials had not yet ruled on the cause of the fire. `` There was no fire alarm, there was no sound,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, who was staying on the fifth floor while on business. `` I knew where the door was and I could feel where the smoke was coming from,'' he said in describing his escape. The <PERSON> Deckers </PERSON> said the fire alarms did sound and four hotel employees went upstairs to knock on doors and alert the guests. `` We had four people who said -LRB- the alarms -RRB- were definitely going off,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said. `` The fire system is excellent. We updated it when we bought the hotel four years ago.'' `` You could see the flames going out the window,'' said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, who was staying on the ninth floor and attending Eastern Division convention of the <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. At least 100 rooms in the 126-room hotel were occupied by people attending the convention, Mrs. <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said. The hotel, which opened in 1922 and has been renovated in recent years, also is the site of major social events in this eastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> city about 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Two of the dead were identified as <PERSON> Monique </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, 58, who lived at the hotel, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, 75, a resident of the <ORGANIZATION> Monocacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towers </ORGANIZATION> retirement home, said County Coroner <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichel </PERSON>. The third victim was identified as <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knouse </PERSON>, 69, said <LOCATION> Lehigh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>. Six people were taken to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luke </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for treatment, including a 65-year-old woman from the retirement home who was in critical condition. Six victims were taken to <ORGANIZATION> Muhlenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and two, ages 79 and 83, were in critical condition, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> millionaire <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was sentenced to the maximum 10 years in prison Saturday after being found guilty of a felony in connection with the attempted murder of a woman who witnessed a slaying. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, half-brother of the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and a <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> native, was charged with murder and conspiracy in the death of <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> `` Hambone'' Barber. State Circuit Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> declared a mistrial on those counts when the jury failed to reach a verdict. The jury convicted <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of accessory after the fact of assault and battery with intent to kill in connection with the attempted murder of <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosemond </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 45, was accused of hiring someone to kill Ms. <PERSON> Rosemond </PERSON>, who witnessed the 1986 murder of Barber. Ms. <PERSON> Rosemond </PERSON> survived a stabbing attack. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> to 10 years in prison, and <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was led away in handcuffs to the <ORGANIZATION> Greenville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've said all along I'm innocent of the charges but I'm prepared to take the punishment the court will mete on me,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said during sentencing <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> declared a mistrial for the four other charges _ murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the Barber slaying and criminal conspiracy and accessory before the fact of assault and battery with intent to kill in connection with the <PERSON> Rosemond </PERSON> attack. Solicitor <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, the prosecutor, said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> will face another trial on those charges. Defense attorneys said they would appeal the conviction and an appeal bond of $ 100,000 was set. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> also reinstated bond of $ 1 million on the other charges. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> remained in custody late Saturday, officials said. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was accused of hiring members of the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rukn </ORGANIZATION> gang of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to come to <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> to kill <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, a former employee and childhood friend. Before beginning deliberations Saturday, the jury asked the judge what would happen if they reached a verdict on only some of the charges. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> told the jurors a mistrial would be called only on those indictments they could n't decide. The jury spent 16 hours deliberating. The trial began Jan. 16. Earlier, defense attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> asked that one of the jurors be removed because <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> had coached the woman's children on a swim team. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> denied the request. <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> said he was `` really upset about the sentence'' but said there was `` logic behind that verdict.'' `` I think the jury probably inferred'' that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> knew about the attack on Ms. <PERSON> Rosemond </PERSON>, <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> said. `` But they did not reach a conclusion that he was involved before or during the incident,'' he said. During the trial <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> traced the history of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rukn </ORGANIZATION> gang and its ties to <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. Witnesses testified that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was a close friend of <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Fort </PERSON>, the leader of the gang, who is serving time in a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> prison on drug charges. Witnesses also testified that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> wielded a significant amount of power in the organization. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> told the jury of <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s stormy relationship with <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, with whom <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> had physically fought and whom <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> believed broke into buildings he owned in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was a victim of a misguided investigation. The attorney argued that prosecutors had made deals with known criminals, who in testifying `` to save their own skin'' had implicated an innocent man.

 Supplies in outlying Alaskan villages dwindled Saturday when delivery trucks were idled by flat tires caused by a brutal cold snap that prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency. The official low for the 12 hours ending at 4 p.m. Saturday was 69 degrees below zero at Farewell Lakes near <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>. The weather service said it also received an unofficial reading of 86 degrees below zero at a lodge near <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, northwest of Fairbanks. The state's all-time low is 80 degrees below zero, recorded at Prospect Creek in 1971. Mid-day temperatures elsewhere in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> on Saturday included 25 below zero at <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> and 44 below at <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION> and Fairbanks. The normal low for January is 6 degrees in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> and 21.6 degrees below zero at <LOCATION> Fairbanks </LOCATION>, according to the weather service. No serious injuries have been blamed on the cold, but Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> issued an emergency declaration Saturday to help make state funds available for emergency services. Delivery systems have been disrupted to rural villages statewide, causing shortages of essential items, <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. Other villages were experiencing cold weather-related problems in the operation of water, sewer, power and heating systems, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said it opened an emergency shelter at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Graham </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and would open a shelter in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> on Saturday because the cold wave threatened to force people from their homes. The Anchorage shelter could handle about 100 people, said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> disaster committee. Another facility in the city would be opened if response exceeded that figure, she said. In <PERSON> Tanana </PERSON>, the driver of a truck that picks up groceries and mail at the airport was unable to make his rounds. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Platten </PERSON> said the record cold flattened three of the truck's tires. `` There's no give to the tires at this temperature,'' <PERSON> Platten </PERSON> said. `` They get a flat spot from sitting and they pop the bead from around the rim or crack at the base of the valve stem when you go to drive.'' The operator of a store at <PERSON> Tanana </PERSON> predicted supplies would last only a few days longer. `` Then we'll be running out of things _ bread, eggs and milk,'' <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> said. The store already was out of <LOCATION> Blazo </LOCATION>, a fuel for portable heaters, he said. Because small planes can not fly in extremely cold weather, many of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s 200 villages have been without mail and food delivery for two weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> stood by to provide food and fuel airlifts to villages needing them, <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said on Friday. Mail and food supplies are stacking up in hub airports such as those at <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kotzebue </LOCATION>, he said. In <LOCATION> Galena </LOCATION>, in central <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, students stayed home Friday after the school was closed so workers could try to thaw a sewer line. Superintendent <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> said oil in fuel lines at the school was congealing. Water and sewer lines at several municipal buildings in <LOCATION> Galena </LOCATION> froze. In <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, a municipal sewage plant operator said that during the last two weeks, calls had been coming in at the rate of 20 to 30 a night from residents with frozen sewer lines. Mail carriers in the city were told to stay outside for no longer than 10 minutes at a time, then retreat to their vehicles or the indoors. With wind chill factors, temperatures have been in excess of 100 below at several locations, including the North Slope on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s northern coast, officials said The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the extreme cold could continue for another week or two in interior <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Meteorologists attributed the brutal temperatures to a mass of cold air they call the Omega Block.

The Port Star sent a distress call to Japanese marine safety officials Saturday morning, saying cargo on the deck of the 850-foot vessel was lost and the 20-member crew was abandoning ship, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>. Coast Guard officials said the Port Star was caught in 30 - to 40-foot seas and winds of 65 to 75 knots, or approximately 75-85 mph, at the time of the distress message Japanese officials alerted the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> and a P-3 aircraft from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> installation at Adak in the Aleutians began a search.

 A railroad tanker filled with sulfur dioxide leaked Saturday, spewing hazardous fumes with the stench of rotten eggs and forcing evacuation of hundreds of people from the downtown area for several hours. Authorities said the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> tanker car was on a siding near the <LOCATION> Boundary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fairgrounds </LOCATION>, adjacent to downtown, when it sprang a two - to three-inch hole shortly after 6:30 a.m.. An estimated 400 to 500 people, some elderly, were forced out of businesses and homes, and sheriff's officers maintained roadblocks to keep people Residents were allowed to return about 3:30 p.m., but were warned they should leave again if they smelled any fumes, said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chrisman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> official. `` Things are looking good,'' <PERSON> Chrisman </PERSON> said. `` All the folks have been returned to their homes.'' Among the evacuees was Boundary County Clerk <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Estep </PERSON>, who said there was no panic and praised civil defense personnel who responded to the evacuation order. `` Our emergency crews did an excellent job,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Estep </PERSON> said. `` I'm really proud of them.'' The tanker continued to leak Saturday afternoon, but <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heffner </PERSON> of the state Communications and <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> said it had been moved about five miles south of town and a nearby farm house was evacuated as a precaution. Crews were venting the gas through barrels of lime to neutralize the sulfur dioxide, <PERSON> Chrisman </PERSON> said. The crews planned to monitor the situation through the night and eventually transfer the material to another tank car. `` It was pretty thick this morning, but it's a lot clearer now,'' <PERSON> Jeannie </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonzo </PERSON>, a sheriff's dispatcher, said late Saturday morning. `` It just hurt to breath it.'' Nine people people were treated for minor eye irritation and respiratory problems at <LOCATION> Boundary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Community </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, then released, a nursing supervisor said. One person with a history of respiratory ailments was admitted for observation. Another person who was downtown at the time of the leak later died of a heart attack at the hospital, but officials were uncertain if the death was related to the leak. Downtown residents were taken to the local high school and to a Methodist church at the south end of town on a hill, sheriff's spokeswoman <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> said All the evacuees later were moved to the church in the town of about 2,000 in the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>, 26 miles south of the Canadian border. The rupture apparently resulted from a structural failure caused by corrosion, said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Lund </PERSON>, a compliance supervisor for the state Division of Environmental Quality's Hazardous Materials Bureau. A hazardous materials team from the <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was on the scene, assessing the danger and beginning a cleanup. A hazardous materials response team from <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> also was sent, along with officials from the state Division of Environmental Quality, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>. Sulfur dioxide is a heavy, colorless, suffocating gas used as a bleach, disinfectant, refrigerant or preservative. It also is used in paper pulping and food processing. It is liquefied under pressure for shipping. <PERSON> Heffner </PERSON> said the leak sent a bluish plume of vapor into the air, but the weight of the gas kept it close to the ground.

 It was too cold for driving, too cold for flying, too cold for just about everything. It was so cold, with wind chill readings of up to 115 degrees below zero, that even dog sled races were canceled. And that is n't just an Alaskan tall tale.

The ruling said rigid racial quotas must be supported by evidence of past discrimination; for example, that black-owned enterprises tried to obtain construction contracts but were denied them. Without such evidence, the use of racial quotas violates the equal-protection rights of whites, the court said.

<BYLINE>Wall Street Asks: New Bull Market? ^By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 To the surprise of almost everybody, and the consternation of more than a few, Wall Street is starting to look as though the great bull market of the mid-1980s is back. Over the past few trading days, stock prices have staged a runaway rise on heavy volume that evokes vivid images of January two years ago. In the heady atmosphere that prevailed then, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average broke 2,000 for the first time and finished the month with a net gain of 262 points. If the market is going to match that performance this month, it will have to get even hotter than it has been in the two January sessions that remain. Some analysts think it is overdue for a breather. Still, it has been an impressive performance, especially when you consider the uncertainty and skepticism that predominated in the financial world as the new year began. To many investors, of course, the news is exhilarating, helping to wipe out both the dollars-and-cents losses and the unpleasant memories created by the crash in the fall of 1987. To others who had been cautiously waiting for `` better'' investment opportunities, however, it has been a nasty surprise. Consider the position in which many money managers at investing institutions such as pension funds find themselves. In the chastened atmosphere that followed the crash, they carefully marshaled cash reserves as a cushion against further trouble ahead. Thus a lot of people were under-represented in stocks when prices took off again. When your clients have suffered a drubbing in the market collapse, how are they going to take it when you tell them they missed out on the recovery? That kind of thinking, analysts say, has prompted a rush to get into the market, and helped keep the rally going. There have been other favorable forces as well, including recent talk in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of restoring a tax break for capital gains and giving dividends better tax treatment as well. But the stocks that would benefit most directly from tax changes, the smaller issues many individual investors like to buy, have n't been the standout gainers in recent weeks Instead, the top performers have been the blue chips and big-name technology issues that are the common currency in which the institutions deal. In the past week the Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip industrials jumped 87.50 points to 2,322.86 for its best weekly showing so far in the rally dating back to late November. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index climbed 3.62 to 164.78; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market rose 6.34 to 397.96, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index rose 2.05 to 321.57. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 196.40 million shares a day, up from 161.40 million the week before. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Stovall-Twenty-First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said catch-up buying by investing institutions has been a predominant force in the market of late. `` The train is leaving the station and they have to get on,'' <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON> said. `` It's just a case of raw supply and demand.'' The current resemblance to the early days of 1987 is a bit spooky, he acknowledged, given the vulnerable position the market reached that year and the debacle that followed. `` I think that anybody who jumps in now is coming late to the feast,'' <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON> said. `` In this environment, it's dangerous because the fundamentals have n't changed very much.''
