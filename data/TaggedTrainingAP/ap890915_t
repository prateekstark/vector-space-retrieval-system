 ABC News would n't have used former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> as a paid expert on a <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> special last June had it known of his business ties there, a spokeswoman said Friday. However, <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> business associate, said there was no conflict of interest in <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>'s appearance on the broadcast. On it, <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> was asked about possible <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for its violence against the student-led demonstrations in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. In his reply, the former Secretary of State in the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administrations stressed the importance of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> regime. `` I would n't do any sanctions,'' he told anchor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> at the time was appearing under a special agreement with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> that he terminated Wednesday after his election as a board member of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> deal, struck in 1982, paid him as a consultant and gave <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> the right to interview him first on any of its broadcasts, including `` World News Tonight'' and <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON>'s `` Nightline,'' but only on breaking stories. He was n't paid for appearances as a guest on these shows, including as `` Nightline'' and `` World News Tonight'' when his interviews did n't concern breaking news, said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Elise </PERSON> <PERSON> Adde </PERSON>. Had ABC News known of his business ties in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, she said, `` we would not have had him on that broadcast'' in June. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> has extensive business interests in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, including the establishment of a $ 75 million fund to be raised from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investors for joint ventures with the merchant banking arm of the Chinese government, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. In addition, his consulting firm <ORGANIZATION> Kissinger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> counsels several businesses on how to conduct operations overseas and, specifically, in their dealings with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the Journal reported. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>'s remarks on the June special were `` not motivated by commercial concerns,'' said <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employee for 23 years, now a senior partner in <ORGANIZATION> Kissinger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an international consulting firm. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>'s remarks on issues like the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last June are solely `` based on what he thinks are the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- nation's interest,'' said <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> deal was not his first with a network news division. He previously had worked for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s news division after after his White House service. Since 1977, he has been a member of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> but under the union's news contract with networks, according union membership rolls. <ORGANIZATION> AFTRA </ORGANIZATION> represents on-air news correspondents and anchors at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. The news contract and the entertainers' contract stipulate different pay scales. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> was busy Friday and was not available for comment, <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said. His election to the 14-member CBS board was by a unanimous vote, a source election said Friday. CBS policy is not to comment on internal board matters. As a CBS board member, <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> will paid the same as other board members, $ 22,000 annually, and $ 750 for each meeting he attends, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Schweitzer </PERSON> said. There is no contract that would make <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> exclusive to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, and his board membership `` has absolutely nothing to do with CBS on-air appearances, `` <PERSON> Schweitzer </PERSON> said. `` In that regard,'' he said, referring to news matters, `` he is <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, private citizen and businessman. And he can be interviewed by anyone.''

<HEAD>U.S. Reported Concerned North Korea Developing Nuclear Arms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` gravely concerned'' that communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> may be developing nuclear weapons, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> reported from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday. It said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is keeping a close watch on possible efforts in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to develop nuclear weapons. <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, the head of the department's <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> section, as saying <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would be as concerned as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> produced such weapons. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is expected to discuss <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s nuclear capability with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> at a meeting in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this month, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> reported. While denying it has nuclear weapons, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has repeatedly charged that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> are equipped with nuclear arms and are preparing for a nuclear war on the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials reject the North Korean claims. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> keeps about 43,000 troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a defense pact. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is the North's main arms supplier. Chances are dim for an improvement soon in the strained relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> despite diplomatic contacts between the two sides in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the report quoted <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> as saying. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> demands immediate withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces are vital to prevent a North Korean attack. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1950, setting off the 3-year Korean War. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces intervened on the side of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and fought under the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> banner. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops have remained in the South ever since.

<TEXT>
 After 9 -LCB- months as prime minister, <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> sees herself as a crusader to save <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> from the clutches of drugs, ethnic violence and rancorous politics. `` I see things in terms of knights in shining armor trying to root out evil,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` That may be a sort of simplistic way to put it, but I am an optimist. I have great dreams for my country and I want to achieve them.'' But she acknowledged her vision might be a bit fanciful. `` I think I am too much of an idealist.'' Educated at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the 36-year-old Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> is the first woman to lead a Moslem nation and as she spoke she had a scarf called a `` dupatta'' draped over her shoulder. When in public she wears the scarf over her head _ the custom of Moslem women _ as a concession to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s religious right wing, a powerful minority that opposes female rule. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and her left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> govern a restless nation of 107 million people burdened by poverty, illiteracy and civil war across the border in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. She said death threats after her government declared war on the heroin trade and drug barons have forced her to think of her safety, something she has resisted since assuming office Dec. 2. `` I do n't believe in a life that is crowded with security,'' she said. `` I think it's kind of nice to be able to slip away, ... after having worked hard for a few days to be able to go for a half an hour walk. `` I just consider it important for a person in public life to try and maintain a sense of normalacy _ to have their feet on the ground.'' As for the drug war, she said, `` We are really now just going after the big people, but it's a much bigger problem. It's just proliferated all over the country like a cancer.'' Western countries estimate that up to 80 percent of the heroin arriving in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> comes from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Drug addiction in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has soared from near zero in 1979 to an estimated 1 million addicts in 1989. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> is also doing battle with an opposition made up of Islamic fundamentalists, conservatives and loyalists of the late president, Gen. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, and his military government. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> overthrew her father, Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, in a 1977 coup and had him hanged two years later for his alleged complicity in a murder plot. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, many of his top generals and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> died in a mysterious plane crash in August 1988, clearing the way for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s first free elections in more than a decade and resulting in Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s election Nov. 16. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> says the most serious threat to her government is ethnic. Hundreds of Pakistanis have died and thousands have been injured since 1986 in violence in her southern home province of <LOCATION> Sindh </LOCATION> in fighting among militant secessionists, Indian Moslem immigrants and internal migrants from poorer provinces. `` During General <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s time ethnic groups became very strong,'' she said. `` They set up armed camps and they trained their people, so it's a situation of almost a mini-kind of a guerrilla war. It's not a guerrilla war against the government, but it's almost a state of anarchy and a rebellion against authority. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> claims that her right-wing political opposition, the nine-party <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, has had a hand in the Sindh violence. She also has implicated neighboring <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in the Sindh troubles. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have fought three wars since they became independent from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947 and they routinely accuse each other of fueling their internal problems. To the west, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> inherited <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s sponsorship of Moslem guerrillas fighting to oust the Soviet-backed government of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. More than 3 million Afghan war refugees huddle in camps dotting <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s western frontier. `` <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> ca n't afford to keep the refugees,'' she said, `` but are the refugees going to go back without political stability? `` So far we have not seen any message or any method that would enable the emergence of an independent <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> or the return of the Afghan refugees. Those remain our goals.'' She also said her political opposition is doomed because of its links to the <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> era, when <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was under martial law and political parties were barred from elections. `` <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> just ca n't afford a return to the decade of repression,'' she said. `` All those who are patriots in the different sectors of life, whether it is civilian or military, recognize that. Therefore, I see no imminent threat to democracy in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.'' But she added that law and order can not survive without economic development in a country where the average yearly wage is under $ 400. `` First you've got to try and create a system, create a rule of law which gives security and, side by side, you've got to have economic improvement and opportunitiees so people can -LRB- give -RRB- better meaning -LRB- to -RRB- their lives,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 As a girl, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Trapp </PERSON> ran through the hills near her home singing songs from `` The Sound of Music.'' It was n't so much theatrics, though, as family tradition. Now she will fill another family role by stepping onto a stage to portray her grandmother, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Trapp </PERSON>, whose flight from Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> inspired the musical. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Trapp </PERSON> makes her debut as <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> in a local theater production of the story made famous by the 1965 movie in which <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> portrayed <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Trapp </PERSON>, the matriarch of the family who died two years ago at age 82. `` I grew up listening to the album with my cousins, and we'd all take parts,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, 35, who learned the tale of the family's flight on her grandmother's knee. `` We used the fields to practice in.'' <PERSON> Trapp </PERSON>, who has sung professionally at the <ORGANIZATION> Trapp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Stowe </PERSON> for three years, also shares the local stage with her 8-year-old cousin <PERSON> Kiersten </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Trapp </PERSON>, cast as another of <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s children `` I've seen the movie five zillion times,'' said <PERSON> Kiersten </PERSON>, squirming impatiently during rehearsal and tugging at her hot-pink T-shirt and miniskirt. `` Until I was 7, I thought it was just about nuns.'' Music, which first brought <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Trapp </PERSON> and his 10 children together as a family during the war, continues to be a shared bond between the younger <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Trapp </PERSON> generation _ as does the family legacy. Six of <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s children remain in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> where the family moved after the escape and their subsequent worldwide tours as the <ORGANIZATION> Trapp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Singers </ORGANIZATION>, with two others buried in <PERSON> Stowe </PERSON> and two living in other states. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> said the youngsters would gather around her father, <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Trapp </PERSON>, one of the children who fled <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> a half century ago, and learn folk songs. `` Acting is a whole new challenge,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, standing before a hand-painted set of the Austrian mountains in the Hyde Park Opera House. `` I am so excited. I think my grandmother was that way. She was excited about life. She was n't discouraged about the problems she encountered.'' Today <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> records her own folk songs and designs Austrian clothing for sale at the lodge gift shop. She designed some of the costumes for the local production, which premieres at the end of the month. `` Being a von <PERSON> Trapp </PERSON>, people are so in awe of you and they treat you differently,'' she said. `` When you grow up with it, you live with that everyday. People say, ` So, you are one of THE von Trapps.' `` Everyone remembers our story. It's universal. I've met people at the lodge who went through the same thing, but we had a story written about it,'' she added. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> likened the current flood of refugees from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> to her family's situation years ago. `` It's happening right now, although the direction people are going has changed,'' she said. `` Is n't it ironic that here I am in little <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> playing the part, and yet the exact same thing is happening there.'' <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Trapp </PERSON> attended the <LOCATION> Hyde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> annual performance six years ago to watch <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> perform a bit-part as a nun. After the performance, the baroness took a bow for the crowd and drew a standing ovation. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> remembers that her grandmother, who gave up her plans to become a nun to marry the baron, always wore a silver cross on a chain around her neck, and until her final years dressed in Austrian costume. `` There was a charm about her that I really appreciated. She had a great sense of humor, and a great way of telling stories. She'd have us rolling on the floor. `` Everybody is interested in the von <PERSON> Trapps </PERSON> _ they are news,'' said the play's director <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. `` People visit the lodge, and then come back year after year to see the show.'' <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> said her performance as <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> adds a new twist to the story, however. `` Some of my family members might say it's just rehashing the story, but I'm experiencing new people and challenges. That's what art's all about.''

<HEAD>Hungary's Reform Course Opens Cracks in Warsaw Pact</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cracks are opening in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact as <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s Communist leadership abandons agreements with its military allies in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in pursuit of new friends and business ties in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, along with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, is in the front rank of reform in the Soviet bloc, eclipsing Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s more modest campaigns. Where the Soviets have adjusted their Communist-dominated system to introduce a measure of democracy and personal freedom, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s Communist leadership has pledged to allow free elections by next June that could end the party's 43-year-old hold on power <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> this week installed the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first government not led by Communists. Where the Soviets favor reducing central control of industries, sentiment in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has swung to scrapping all state interference in the economy in favor of market forces. This week, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> enraged <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> hard-liner <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by allowing thousands of East Germans to cross its border to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Hungarian officials have been candid about the risks of the country's shift. `` There is a danger of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> becoming isolated in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as some of the things <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is doing irritate our neighbors and allies,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> told Hungarian radio Aug. 29. `` Altering our approach, however, would mean curtailing our freedom of action.'' An unprecedented plan announced Sept. 8 to cooperate with neutral <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and non-aligned <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> in setting up demilitarized zones along common borders is perhaps the clearest sign of a cautious move away from the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s aspirations extend even farther westward, with leaders knocking on the doors of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest trading bloc. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> already has privileges with the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> unique within the Soviet bloc. It signed a 10-year agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> in June 1988 granting it reduced tariffs on its exports to <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> nations. The accord is the most liberal the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> has signed with a Soviet bloc country. Hungarian leaders used the recent East German refugee standoff to press their case with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for a political voice in the bloc. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> did not go public with a promise to support those wishes. But Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> subsequently said his country will give full backing to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economic reforms, and expectations are that West German gratitude over the East German exodus will translate into generous financial aid. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised Hungarian reforms during a July visit, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week voted to extend by three years instead of the customary one year <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s Most Favored Nation trading status, which offers the best tariff rates. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s leaders say they have Soviet blessings for the increasing independence that is moving them closer to the West, but the reforms are breaking <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> away from some other traditional allies. Relations are worst with <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> because of disputes over the fate of 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> says they are being systematically persecuted, an accusation <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> denies. Tensions exploded after <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> broke an agreement two years ago that had committed it to return those fleeing <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s Stalinist system. Since then, more than 20,000 Romanians, mostly ethnic Hungarians, have found sanctuary in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Relations hit bottom in July after <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, expressed anxiety that the war of words could escalate to violence. <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, referring to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s boast in April that it could build nuclear missiles, expressed fears <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> could be a target of such weapons one day. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> gave up all pretense of `` fraternal'' ties with the Romanian military Sept. 7, announcing that <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s deputy defense minister would not visit as planned. Tensions of a different kind have been building on <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s northern border with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> Because of budgetary and environmental pressures, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> abruptly stopped work in May on a joint <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> dam project agreed to in 1977. This enraged Czechoslovak partners. The Czechoslovaks accused <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> of breaking their word. The Hungarians said the Czechosklovaks were planning to `` violate international law'' by unilaterally diverting a river that forms part of the countries' common boundary. Growing bitterness over the dam project has been exacerbated by political differences. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s leaders used the Aug 21 anniversary of the 1968 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to denounce the move, which crushed a Czechoslovak reform movement. Polish leaders also criticized the invasion. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is the latest to join the chorus of East European critics of the reform-minded Hungarians, its ire raised by <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>'s decision to open a westward escape route for thousands of East Germans. State-controlled East German media accused <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> of being bought by the West Germans, and the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> filed a formal protest over the action. The Soviet reaction to change in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has ranged from praise to tolerance. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has pointed to Hungarian economic reforms as examples to inspire Soviet workers, and Hungarian electoral reforms are reported broadly in state-run Soviet media. But <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> indicated Kremlin reservations about the refugee exodus, describing it as `` unusual.''

 A federal judge has lifted his order that would have required Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> to testify on the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed $ 78 million settlement with neighbors of the nuclear weapons plant at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>. However, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> also criticized <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> on Wednesday as appearing insensitive to the worries of people who live near the Feed Materials Production Center, a uranium processing plant. `` It's no secret that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that it will cost millions, maybe billions, to clean up the site,'' <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> could have reassured to neighbors concerned about cleanup costs. Several businesses near the plant say they interpret the settlement to mean that they can not sue to recover from the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> any costs of radioactive materials cleanup on private property. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agrees with that assessment, but lawyers for the neighbors disagree. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> first invited, then last week ordered, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> to testify on that issue, saying a final word was needed from the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s top official. But <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> lawyers opposed <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>'s request, saying it was unnecessary and beyond his authority. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> said, in papers filed with <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>, the government would appeal if the judge insisted on compelling testimony from <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, a Cabinet officer. <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> said the issue had `` constitutional implications.'' After hearing from both sides Wednesday, <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> ruled from the bench that he would decide the issue of cleanup costs on the basis of the case record and would not require <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' testimony. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said that to do otherwise would probably prompt a time-consuming government appeal that would further delay a resolution for the plant's neighbors. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> directed lawyers for the government and neighbors to meet and resolve the issue this week. The 38-year-old plant, about 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnti </LOCATION>, processes uranium for use elsewhere in making the government's nuclear weapons Neighbors of the plant filed their class-action suit in 1985 on behalf of 14,000 people living within five miles of the plant. The suit contended that radioactive pollution from the plant lowered property values and caused them emotional distress. The settlement was reached June 30. <ORGANIZATION> Ruetgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which have operations near the plant, argued at a hearing on the settlement Aug. 23 that its terms would prevent them from suing to recover the cost of any future environmental cleanup on their properties.

 Near the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Chelyabinsk </LOCATION>, skulls pierced by bullet holes were found where gold once was mined. In <LOCATION> Kolpashova </LOCATION>, a Siberian village on the <LOCATION> Ob </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, excavations released a stream of mummified corpses to float down the river. In the Ukrainian city of <LOCATION> Poltava </LOCATION>, diggers at a sand quarry uncovered a series of trenches full of bones _ the remains of an estimated 5,000 people. `` This is a country built on bones,'' says <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Golovanov </PERSON>, a member of a group called Memorial that is dedicated to the memory of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims. The bones lay undisturbed for decades while the Soviet government refused to acknowledge the estimated 20 million victims of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s bloody years of terror Now they are coming back to haunt the country. About once a month for the past year, the official press has reported the unearthing of another mass grave as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reveals the horror of its past. On Tuesday, Soviet television carried another report, this one about the reburial of 350 skeletons found on a mountain near <LOCATION> Chelyabinsk </LOCATION>. A correspondent said innocent `` men, women, old people and even children'' _ possibly as many as 300,000 _ were loaded onto trucks and shot at night. The Memorial group found the remains buried in a former gold mine where authorities wanted to build houses. Now officials plan to turn the area into a memorial, the correspondent said. A reburial ceremony is also planned Saturday for the remains of 540 of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims found at a garbage dump in the Ukrainian coal center of <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Golovanov </PERSON> coordinates efforts to track down the mass graves for Memorial, the national group lobbying to clear the names of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s `` enemies of the people,'' as well as help their families and those who survived years in labor camps He believes there could be as many as 100,000 unmarked mass graves left as a legacy from the purges, repressions and labor camps <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> oversaw from the late 1920s until his death in 1953. Press coverage of the graves began last year when a killing field was found in the Kuropaty forest of <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>. It escalated with a similar discovery in <LOCATION> Bykovnya </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. Memorial receives a steady stream of letters with information about newly revealed sites, and <PERSON> Golovanov </PERSON> said he sometimes wonders, `` What is your goal in digging them up?'' He answers: to make sure people know all the evil of the Stalin years. He believes there is a need to restore respect to the dead. `` You're walking, and they're lying there under you, and not a single person knows about their fate,'' he said. <PERSON> Golovanov </PERSON> believes the caches of bones also make a forceful statement about the country's Communist rulers. `` The people in the government are the same now as they were then,'' he said. `` People ca n't help but see that.'' The party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last month ordered local governments to do all they could to redress Stalin-era wrongs, including cooperating with groups like Memorial. `` Mass burial places should be recognized as official cemeteries,'' the decree said, and `` organs of the police and the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> should be more involved in this work.'' But <PERSON> Golovanov </PERSON> said revealing and marking the old graves remains fraught with conflicts. The <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, whose predecessor, the <ORGANIZATION> NKVD </ORGANIZATION>, carried out much of the killing, often does not open its files to help find graves and identify victims. <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officials say their archives are in such terrible shape they are n't worth examining. Even after the grave sites are identified, some local authorities insist on using the land for new housing, garages or other projects. In <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION>, the local government had turned the killing field over to developers and was reluctant to change its plans, the youth newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. Eventually, authorities agreed to turn most of the land into a memorial park. In Poltava, the grave site is now a dump. An unsigned letter to Memorial from Poltava described how a man unearthed the trenches of corpses at a sand quarry in 1968 and was ordered by authorities to cover them. `` Once a year, since then, I've visited that area, since I supposed that my father was resting there too,'' he wrote. `` He was rehabilitated in 1959,'' posthumously.

 Emigration from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is rising sharply, both from reform-minded nations relaxing requirements for Western departures and from hard-line Communist nations. Here are the available figures on departures from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and explanations of the procedures in each country: <LOCATION> SOVIET </LOCATION> <LOCATION> UNION </LOCATION> _ Since <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rose to power in May 1985 and embarked on a broad reform course, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has let increasing numbers of citizens emigrate. In 1988, a record 108,000 Soviets left for permanent resettlement abroad, mostly ethnic Germans, Armenians and Jews. This year authorities expect the figure to reach 200,000, compared to less than 1,000 per year in the early 1980s. Soviets must submit to a lengthy and bureaucratic process to gain permission to emigrate, but refusals are now reported to be less than 1 percent of applications. EAST <LOCATION> GERMANY </LOCATION> _ Both legal emigration to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and unauthorized flight to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> are up dramatically this year, as <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> witnesses the largest migration westward since the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall was built in 1961. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> expects well over 100,000 East Germans to arrive this year, both legal immigrants and a growing number of escapees fleeing through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s newly opened borders. East Germans get automatic citizenship in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Less than 40,000 East Germans have been allowed to leave for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in each of the past 28 years, with the numbers dipping to below 1,000 annually in the 1960s. The recent migration wave stems from dissatisfaction among East Germans with their leadership's refusal to emulate the reforms sweeping <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> POLAND </LOCATION> _ Since passport laws were revised Jan. 1 to allow virtually any citizen to travel abroad, the issue for Poles has not so much been getting permission to leave as getting visas to get into other countries. Most emigres are ethnic Germans resettling in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, or those with close relatives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who leave to join them. More than 140,000 Poles of German origin emigrated last year, and 3,500 left for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visas will rise to 4,500 this year, while the exodus to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has tapered off somewhat, though official figures are unavailable. <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> reported at the end of last year that during the 1980s, more than 400,000 Poles failed to return from trips abroad. <LOCATION> HUNGARY </LOCATION> _ Figures are not available for legal emigration from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> prior to liberalized travel codes adopted in January 1988, but the departures are thought to have been limited to a few hundred family reunification cases each year. <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> officials have also acknowledged that an average of 2,500 to 3,000 Hungarians failed to return from authorized trips aboard each year during the 1980s, accounting for the majority of departures. Those desiring to leave now are awaiting a new emigration law being drafted by the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. It is expected to result in a system similar to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s in which anyone with a sponsor abroad will be allowed to leave <LOCATION> CZECHOSLOVAKIA </LOCATION> _ The last sizeable wave of emigres from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> was in 1969, when 110,000 fled after the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion the previous year and before the borders were sealed. Czechoslovaks now can get to the West only to join spouses abroad, by failing to return from authorized foreign trips or in rare circumstances when they are allowed to join close relatives abroad. Unofficial sources say the number leaving, both legally and illegally, ranges between 6,000 and 8,000 per year. <LOCATION> ROMANIA </LOCATION> _ In the most hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, legal emigration is steady under fixed quotas while escapes have increased as Romanians driven to despair chance dangerous departures to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The West German government takes in about 12,000 ethnic Germans freed from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> each year. About 1,000 Jews are allowed to go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> annually, and 2,000 to 3,000 other departures are permitted, mostly to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. More than 20,000 Romanians of Hungarian descent have been given refuge in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> after fleeing illegally, and thousands more have escaped to the West through <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> BULGARIA </LOCATION> _ Emigration from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> consists primarily of ethnic Turks leaving for <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Nearly 270,000 Turkish Bulgarians have fled or been expelled just since May, when <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> began issuing passports to those claiming repression under a forced assimilation campaign that began in 1984. Legal emigration and escapes over the years are thought to be only a few hundred annually, and no official figures are available.

He moved to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> after World War II, but had been in ill health since last year, his son said. In July, he suffered a stroke, and doctors amputated a leg. Historians consider <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Prado </PERSON> one of the founders of mambo, a bouncy blend of tropical music highlighting trumpets and drums that became popular after the war in such cities as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Popular songs included `` Patricia'' and `` Mambo No. 8.'' The dance known as the mambo is similar to the cha-cha. It features a syncopated beat with lots of hip motion. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Prado </PERSON>, affectionately called `` seal face'' by his fans for the barking sound he made while playing his music, was in some ways a prisoner of his own success. He tried to change his musical style after the mambo craze died down, but ardent fans kept demanding the rhythms they were used to. He is survived by a wife and two children. He is to be buried Friday in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

 Negotiators for the Salvadoran government and leftist rebels reached an agreement Thursday night on a framework for negotiations to end their nearly 10-year-old war, an observer to the talks said. `` It's clear that the two sides have reached a clear agreement that they should be attempting to reach not just a cease-fire but an end to hostilities,'' said <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, the auxiliary bishop of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. A preliminary statement by <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said the sides had reached an accord on how to prepare the meetings and on participation of the church in the talks. He said substantive themes would be discussed at the next meeting. The current round of talks began Wednesday with a two-day schedule, but the two sides were still negotiating late into the night Thursday on a final statement. <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said he `` had the impression'' the future meetings would be held on a monthly basis and that they would include international observers. He added that the talks would take place inside and outside <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Earlier in the day, the Marxist rebels and U.S.-backed government argued about the pace of peace talks to end the war, which has taken 70,000 lives. One rebel leader, <PERSON> Shafick </PERSON> <PERSON> Handal </PERSON>, told reporters the government's concern for procedural matters was `` very restrictive. Fighting continued in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, despite a unilateral truce declared by the guerrillas. Army spokesmen in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> said four guerrillas were killed, two guerrillas and one soldier were wounded, a helicopter was damaged and two buses were torched. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, Col. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Zepeda </PERSON>, the vice minister of defense, called the rebel proposal to reorganize and reduce the size of the armed forces a thinly disguised attempt to seize power. `` We continue to be the object of Marxist aggression,'' <PERSON> Zepeda </PERSON> said. Government representatives had insisted that procedural issues be settled first, setting aside discussion of a rebel offer to lay down their arms and reorganize as a political party in exchange for democratic reforms. Sources for both sides also said they were divided on whether some negotiating sessions should take place without the presence of observers or <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> mediators. The guerrillas made the proposal Wednesday in their first talks with the government in two years. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s government has not presented a peace plan, but the five-man delegation arrived with a proposal calling for two days of talks every two months. Rebels leaders said they want a faster-paced negotiating plan. Both sides say they want to end the war. Salvadoran Ambassador <PERSON> Sigfrido </PERSON> <PERSON> Munes </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> told reporters Thursday that the rebel proposal shows `` a new attitude, a more realistic attitude.'' Munes is not a member of the government delegation, but he said he feels optimistic. The meeting is the first between the rebels and the elected <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> government of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, who took office June 1 after elections boycotted by the insurgents. The rebels' peace proposal calls for a cease-fire by Nov. 15 in exchange for broad reforms, including appointing a new <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and justice minister and moving up legislative and municipal elections scheduled for 1991. The guerrillas also say a truce is conditional on military reorganization, including a reduction in the number of troops, expanded land reform and the prosecution of death squad members. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>, founder of <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s party, has been accused of playing a key role in rightist death squads that have murdered thousands of leftists, suspected leftists and other government opponents. Under the final stage of their proposal, the guerrillas call for constitutional and electoral reforms and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agreement to replace military aid to the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> government with economic aid. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> is the largest recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid in the hemisphere. The rebel plan contains many proposals rejected before, but the wording this time is much milder and the rebels have dropped a longstanding insistence on merging their army with the goverment armed forces. Their offer to become a political party also is new. Negotiations in 1984 and 1987 failed.

<TEXT>
 Jewish settlers in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> say they are trapped between stone-throwing <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> and an indecisive government. Since the Palestinian uprising began 21 months ago, nails have been strewn on their roads and their cars are targets of stones and firebombs. Glass window panes have been replaced with plastic and travel is often safest in convoy. The settlers complain bitterly that the government is torn on how to put down the uprising and, indeed, on the future of the occupied land itself. The result, they say, is that the army is not doing enough to protect them. `` Of course I am fearful,'' settler <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Barat </PERSON> told visitors to this fenced, hilltop settlement east of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. `` If there is debate in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, it undercuts us.'' <PERSON> Barat </PERSON>, 40, a computer scientist, is among more than 70,000 Jews who have moved to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> since the territories were captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Some are `` ideological'' settlers, convinced that Jews must reclaim the biblical land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Others, like <PERSON> Barat </PERSON>, see themselves as part of a front line against a Palestinian state. Still others are lured by the promise of free land and subsidized mortgages. Settlers have become targets in the uprising since many Palestinians see them as one more encroachment on Arab land. Almost half the 1.7 million Palestinians in the territories are refugees whose families fled <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> when it was founded in 1948. The settlers say the army, which recently began deploying extra troops along highways and stepped up escorts for settler convoys at night, still needs to do more. `` Instead of soldiers killing mosquito after mosquito, let them drain the swamp,'' said <PERSON> Kiryat </PERSON> <PERSON> Arba </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> Eliyakim </PERSON> <PERSON> Haetzni </PERSON>, a leader of the settlers' umbrella group, Gush Emunim, or Bloc of the Faithful. `` We demand the deportation of 5,000 people _ members of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> establishment, stone-throwers and their families _ to show them that stone throwing is not a national sport,'' <PERSON> Haetzni </PERSON> said. `` Arabs must know that they can live here only if we can live here.'' Some Jewish settlers have poisoned Arab vineyards, raided villages and fired on suspected stone throwers, killing at least 23 Palestinians in the past 21 months. Tensions also have increased because of the government's proposal for elections in the territories leading to an interim peace solution. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has repeatedly said he will refuse to give up any occupied land, and his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc urges creation of more Jewish communities in the territories. But the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, partner in the coalition Cabinet with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, advocates trading land for peace and calls for suspending the creation of more settlements if peace talks get under way. The 130 settlements built so far run counter to the U.S.-backed land-for-peace solution, which the Palestinians demand. By far the largest number of settlers live in communities close to the pre-1967 border. Some of the settlements deeper in the territories have populations of only several hundred people. <PERSON> Meron </PERSON> <PERSON> Benvenisti </PERSON>, an Israeli analyst who has studied development in the territories for a decade, notes that more than three-quarters of the settlers live within commuting distance of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. `` They have come to see themselves as suburbanites of the major cities,'' he said. <PERSON> Benvenisti </PERSON> said the settlements depend heavily on government subsidies for survival. He calculates that the government and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> have spent $ 2.5 billion in the past 20 years building the new communities, providing basic services like water and roads and resettling Jewish families. Settlers often live rent-free in mobile homes while they build their houses. There is no cost for the land. Mortgages are subsidized, and fees for sewer and water connections are considerably less than in Israeli towns. The goverment plans at least seven new settlements by 1992, but budget constraints have forced the focus of late on trying to increase the population in existing communities. The number of new settlers fell to 4,500 last year from an average of 8,000 in previous years, apparently because of fears over the uprising, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dekel </PERSON>, the prime minister's adviser on settlement affairs. But settlement advocates hope the trend can be reversed. <PERSON> Dekel </PERSON> predicted that the Jewish population in the territories would reach 125,000 in five years, even if the Arab revolt continues. `` People have become used to the uprising,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is doubling food aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to $ 100 million next year `` to support the process of change'' there, but the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> author of a rival plan calls it a merely a stopgap effort. Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan does not go nearly far enough to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> meet its long-term needs <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced the food aid increase for fiscal 1990 on Thursday, just hours after <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> unveiled his own $ 2.5 billion `` food for peace'' package. The president's plan calls for shipments to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> of beef, pork, corn, butter, butter oil, sunflower oil, cotton and rice. The new $ 50 million infusion was in addition to $ 50 million in food <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced in early August for the new fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. It is on top of $ 8.4 million in emergency food assistance <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered for the current fiscal year. Most of the food shipments will come from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> surpluses. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has been affected by severe food shortages and increasing prices. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been under mounting pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to do more to aid <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new Solidarity-led government, not only from Democrats but from <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision Thursday `` a good investment in democracy and political reform for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' `` The president's original proposal was made at a time when <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, while taking some important steps in political reform, still had a communist-dominated government,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` It seemed important to me to signal our intent to do more for a democratic government than we had for a communist regime,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who visited <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> last month with his wife, <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan `` a welcome but stopgap effort that fails to give <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> the long-term help it needs to restructure its agricultural economy and to sustain the world's newest democracy.'' The Democrat's $ 2.5 billion rival program includes forgiveness of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s $ 2 billion agricultural debt, $ 150 million in food shipments, $ 100 million in foreign aid and a series of trade concessions and other assistance. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called his Polish food aid package `` one element of our continuing effort, working with our allies and others, to support the process of change that is underway in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' The overall $ 108.4 million food package _ which does not require congressional approval _ is in addition to a $ 119 million plan of economic assistance <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced in July when he visited <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` We expect that shipments of the new -LRB- food -RRB- assistance will arrive in time for the difficult winter months,'' he said in a statement. He said high prices and food shortages have placed a `` heavy burden on the Polish people.'' `` It is intended that the food aid will support long-term reform of the Polish agricultural system by providing much needed commodities during a transitional period toward a market economy,'' the president said. The package `` underscores our continuing commitment to assist the Polish government and people in their efforts to introduce market principles and to build a private sector that will enable <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to invigorate its economy,'' he continued. While the initial $ 50 million is mostly in food grants, the new $ 50 million installment will be composed of direct shipments, subsidized sales and some low-interest loans, administration officials said.

<HEAD>Air Board Orders New Anti-Pollution Devices</HEAD>

 The state <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday ordered that as of 1994, new cars in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> must offer advanced computerized systems to warn drivers about faulty automobile equipment that causes pollution. The new technology was approved by a 7-0 vote following a public hearing crowded with more than 75 auto industry representatives and environmental advocates. The advanced system, state officials said, would result in quicker repairs of defective parts, leading to lower emissions of smog-producing hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide. Resulting reductions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides would amount to more than 100 tons a day apiece statewide, according to an air board staff report. Almost half the reduction would be in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> counties, the area that suffers the most polluted air in the nation. The dashboard diagnostic system, which air board staff members estimate could cost manufacturers $ 45 per vehicle, would have two purposes: to improve air quality and to help mechanics repair high-tech auto equipment designed to monitor and limit noxious emissions. Air board engineering studies chief <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Albu </PERSON> said it would have a `` greater impact on emissions than any other single control measure adopted by the board.'' Among those supporting the new regulation were the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the Automobile Club of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Engineers for major auto makers said they like the idea of expanded on-board diagnostics but raised technical questions and requested more time to devise the detection systems. `` Due to the need to develop new, unproven technology, considerable lead-time is needed,'' said <PERSON> Suanne </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a staff scientist for the <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. She said the association urged that implementation be delayed until the 1996 model year and phase-in be extended to the 1998 model year. The manufacturers' group is a Detroit-based industry group that includes <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>. The state board, however, decided to order the changes in 1994, with full compliance ordered by 1996. `` In the state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, we have to be aggressive,'' said <PERSON> Jananne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpless </PERSON>, board chairman. Board member <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagarias </PERSON> said the dashboard system would provide for `` smart warning lights'' as opposed to current `` idiot lights.'' On-board monitor lights the air board ordered on new cars beginning in 1988 warn drivers they need repairs only when basic emission-related parts such as the fuel system fail to work. The new system will require improved monitoring of the fuel system but also monitor engine misfiring, catalytic converter efficiency and chlorofluorocarbon leaks in air conditioning systems. The regulation calls for on-board computers to store data that would help repairmen identify faulty equipment. It also calls for standardized computer technology to allow a universal scanning tool so any repair shop can access the data in the vehicle computer.

 The Miss America Pageant is playing down the swimsuit competition this year, but a competitor hopes to draw viewers interested in more flesh. The Platinum Doll Bikini Contest, with comedian <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Byner </PERSON> as host, is one in a series of naughty contests that have sprung up over the years to counter the pageant's wholesome image. Today's contest features 36 go-go girls from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said contest producer <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Cirucci </PERSON>. Instead of the scholarship offered by the Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> program, the go-go girls will be competing for a $ 10,000 cash prize and the `` platinum G-string award,'' <PERSON> Cirucci </PERSON> said. The second-prize winner gets $ 5,000 and third prize is $ 3,000. Fourth - and fifth-place runners-up get trips to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> The contestants were auditioned by the contest organizers _ not selected in state `` pageants'' _ and no interview was required, he said. No evening gowns in this contest _ a selection of costumes will be stripped off to reveal halters and G-strings. `` We have one girl wearing a nun outfit, another who's a cowboy, one who will be a nurse,'' he said. The winner will not be serenaded by `` There She Is'' but instead will dance down the stage to `` a good rock' n' roll band,'' <PERSON> Cirucci </PERSON> said. `` We hope to steal some thunder away from the <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pageant </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Cirucci </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, director of the venerable <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pageant </ORGANIZATION>, which crowns Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on Saturday night, called the G-string contest `` ludicrous'' and said it will not take away his audience. `` It does n't mean a thing to us,'' he said. ` It's somebody just trying to exploit us, and it will not affect us at all.'' Judges for the Platinum Doll Bikini Contest include former <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phillies </ORGANIZATION> pitcher <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>; <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bongiovi </PERSON>, uncle of rock star <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovi </PERSON> and owner of a recording studio; and <PERSON> Gennaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Meoli </PERSON>, a fashion designer for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cirucci </PERSON> said. The G-string contest is not the first time a promoter has tried to strip away some of the <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pageant </ORGANIZATION>'s luster. In the 1970s, several Miss Nude USA pageants were held the week before Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The G-string contest was to be held at a Boardwalk nightclub.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may be land of the free and home of the brave, but it's also the country of the fat. A researcher on obesity says that 33 million adult Americans, about 20 percent of the adult population, are significantly obese, giving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> one of the highest populations of fat people in the world. `` It's clear that significant obesity appears to be more prevalent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> than elsewhere,'' Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bray </PERSON>, a professor of medicine at <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. `` The greater the excess weight, the greater excess risk'' of resulting health problems, he said. Obesity is a public health concern only in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and the percentage of significantly overweight people is highest by far in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bray </PERSON> said. The scientist said researchers do n't know why there is a higher percentage of fat adults in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> than elsewhere, though he suggests it could be because of the highly mechanized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> civilization that makes it easy to avoid walking or climbing stairs. <PERSON> Bray </PERSON> says statistics suggest Americans are eating a better diet now _ avoiding meats and other foods high in animal fats _ but the number of significantly obese people `` continues to creep up.'' The effects of excess weight is showing up in health studies that show the obese are suffering more heart attacks, more high blood pressure, more diabetes and more gall bladder disease. Being extremely fat, <PERSON> Bray </PERSON> said, is only slightly less of a health risk than smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. Bray, president-elect of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obesity </ORGANIZATION>, said doctors consider significant obesity to be a weight about 30 percent above what would be ideal for a person's age, stature and gender Thus, a man whose ideal weight is 170 to 180 pounds becomes `` significantly'' obese if his weight balloons to 221 to 234. At that point, he becomes almost twice as likely to develop a life-shortening ailment, <PERSON> Bray </PERSON> said. But numbers on the weight scale do n't tell the full story. `` It's not just how fat you are, but where the fat is located, that will determine your risk,'' said Bray. Researchers now believe that fat located within the abdominal cavity poses a greater health hazard than does fat located in the extremities or just under the skin. `` The reasons for this are not clear,'' said <PERSON> Bray </PERSON>. `` The most widely accepted explanation is that when you've got more fat in your belly around your organs, it is that fat that is released when you eat fatty acids.'' Because of its proximity, such fat is thought to go directly to the liver, where `` it sets up risk factors that we associate with heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and gall bladder disease,'' he said. Adult men, said Bray, seem most at risk of developing this unhealthy deposit of abdominal fat. Age also plays a factor, he added, because few children or young adults develop this type of fat deposit. `` For women, the visceral fat does n't seem to increase until there is a lot of total fat,'' he said. `` Women are protected against visceral fat to some degree, for some reason.'' Smoking affects visceral, or central, fat, said Bray, and stopping smoking tends to cause this fat to disappear, even though the former smoker may gain fat in other areas. Again, why this is so is not well understood, but he said, `` this is another good reason to stop smoking.'' Another study elsewhere shows that American youth are becoming more muscular, but also more sedentary _ a lifestyle that has made them fatter and triggered an `` ominous'' loss of cardiovascular health. A report by the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund-Amateur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> testing program, which surveyed 12,000 youths from 1980 to 1989, said there is no perceptible increase in height for the various age groups studied and that weight gains can be attributed to poorer diet and physical habits.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s vote to halt smoking on all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline flights leaves tobacco interests and advocates of the ban jockeying over how severe the final version of the restrictions will be. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decided by voice vote to forbid cigarette smoking on all domestic airline routes after routing an effort by tobacco industry supporters to block the provision. Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sent President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a separate measure containing $ 225 million to begin construction of the government's latest boon for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the $ 5 billion super conducting supercollider Final passage of the $ 11.9 billion transportation bill for fiscal 1990 containing the smoking restrictions was held up by a dispute over unrelated anti-drug spending. But when that comes, the next step will be for <ORGANIZATION> Senate-House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators to write compromise legislation that can be sent to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The House last month approved a milder version of the ban which would permanently bar smoking on flights of two hours or shorter. Lobbyist <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutsch </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION>, one of several airline unions working for the total ban, said lobbyists were trying to discern the leanings of lawmakers who will negotiate on the measure. `` You can bet the ones who are unsure or leaning the other way will be hearing from us over the next few days,'' she said. Spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of the cigarette industry's trade group, the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said his side had not given up hope of toning down the restrictions. `` It's not the law yet,'' he said. `` It's our positive outlook that less extreme legislation will be the result'' of the House-Senate bargaining. In the showdown 77-21 vote Thursday, senators forced a halt to delaying tactics pro-smoking lawmakers had hoped would lead to looser restrictions. `` We did n't undertake that vote in the belief we could defeat'' the proposed ban, Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., who fought the proposal, conceded Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, who sponsored the ban proposal and who cited health concerns about lingering cigarette smoke in airline cabins, said, `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are overwhelmingly in support of this suspension of smoking on airliners.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version would extend the ban to all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> routes 95 days after the bill becomes law. Current restrictions prohibit smoking on flights of two hours or less _ four-fifths of all routes _ and will otherwise expire next April. Passengers caught smoking would be subject to $ 1,000 fines and people found to have disabled smoke detectors in aircraft restrooms would face penalties of up to $ 2,000. Opponents of the ban argued there is no proof that cigarette fumes harm nonsmokers, and that the smoke is merely one of many chemicals adrift in the recirculated air inside airliners. They called on supporters to await a <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> study on airliner air quality expected by early next year. They also said the restriction would hurt tobacco growers. But supporters cited several studies concluding that nonsmokers risk cancer and other diseases by so-called passive smoking and said there was no reason to wait for a total prohibition. The money for the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> atom smasher was part of an $ 18.6 billion energy and water measure approved on a voice vote. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> resident, is expected to sign the bill. The circular, 53-mile-long supercollider is to be built 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Scientists will use it to hurtle proton beams into each other in a search for the basic building blocks of matter. The measure also contains $ 1.6 billion towards cleaning up the nation's nuclear weapons plants, about 70 percent more than the $ 975 million provided this year and 27 percent more than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> requested. The overall task of removing radioactive waste from the facilities has been estimated at $ 100 billion.

 When <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohutynski </PERSON> went to divorce court, the key issue was visitation rights _ with the <LOCATION> Moluccan </LOCATION> cockatoo she and her ex-husband had raised from a fledgling. `` It's a little weird, a little strange,'' she said in a telephone interview Thursday. `` I walked into work and everybody was laughing.'' The couple has no children, but snowy white, orange-crested Magic `` is like a baby,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Kohutynski </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Hickory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. `` He's very affectionate, very loving,'' she said of the $ 3,000 bird she has not seen in a year. `` He goes up on your arm and leans against your shoulder for a hug.''

 The hourly tolling of a church bell has been a melodious tradition in this little farming community, but for a couple that moved next door it's more like an all-night alarm clock. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnall </PERSON>, who bought their house next door to the century-old clock last year, sued the town after the board of selectmen declined to silence the clock between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. The couple, who say the chiming ruins their sleep, lost their bid for a preliminary injunction to silence the clock in April. But Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keady </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> has said he will hear arguments on the issue Oct. 5 in <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Both sides have already made their case loud and clear. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnall </PERSON> says he has given up trying to get to sleep before midnight, when the bell tolls 12 times. And Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION>, who has prescribed sleeping pills for <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnall </PERSON>, maintained in a letter to the judge that the bell is `` affecting Mrs. <PERSON> Carnall </PERSON>'s work and well-being.'' The Carnalls contend they have been unable to adjust to the bonging of the 1,800-pound bell on the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, 50 feet from their home. But Hatfield Town Counsel <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> contended that the sound of the bell is simply part of life in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> village of 3,200 people. He said the Carnalls, both of whom were born and raised in the area, should have noticed the bell tower and considered that before buying the house. The selectmen contend the only previous complaint they ever received about the bell was when it did n't sound. They said more than 200 townsfolk signed petitions in support of the clock.

 Officials across <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> struggling to house a crush of refugees have set up camping trailers, commandeered school gymnasiums and even tried to persuade new arrivals to go elsewhere. The East Germans are only the latest wave of refugees, who have strained <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s social services and housing stock. More than 400,000 ethnic Germans from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are expected this year alone; the number of East Germans will easily top previous predictions of 100,000. In addition, tens of thousands of asylum seekers from various countries arrive each year in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, already one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most densely populated countries. Social services and school and local budgets in many communities already are stretched to the limit, and affordable housing is increasingly rare in this country of 62 million people. The East Germans began arriving Monday when <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> defied its <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact ally <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and allowed them to cross into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> en route to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. By Thursday, at least 13,000 East Germans had arrived. `` I have full understanding for why they would especially like to live in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, where they are closest to their homeland,'' the city's mayor, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Momper </PERSON>, said Thursday. But he urged the new arrivals not to flood his city, saying it already has cared for a disproportionately high number of other refugees. `` People have more trouble finding housing and work here,'' <PERSON> Momper </PERSON> said in an address to the local parliament. He called on the federal government to solve the housing problem as soon as possible for the East German refugees. `` Words about life in freedom do n't fill up the stomach or put a roof over anyone's head,'' he said. Most of the East Germans refugees are staying with friends and relatives. Still, many have needed temporary shelter provided by various West German states. <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, for example, set up 60 camping trailers at a city camp site. `` Trailers are better than tents,'' said <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>'s social services director, <PERSON> Ortwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Runde </PERSON>. `` They let the people have more freedom, and they're better suited for the winter months.'' In <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>, the No. 2 official of the Hesse state <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said sports fans should not worry that local school gymnasiums had been requisitioned as temporary shelters. `` They can be cleared out and used for sports again because the majority of the newcomers have quickly gone on to friends and relatives,'' <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said the centrally located state even planned to close 15 of the 20 emergency shelters now that the wave of East German refugees apparently has peaked. Still, the long-term housing situation will remain a problem in a country where families with two children live in two-bedroom apartments measuring 120 square yards and often less. Many of the newcomers are young people in their 20s and 30s, and many are families with young children. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, government spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said federal officials will meet soon to map a housing strategy.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Asked to Hear Challenge in Dalkon Shield Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of women has appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to review <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization plan and its $ 2.5 billion settlement for victims of the Dalkon Shield birth-control device. The appeal was filed Thursday _ the deadline for opponents of the Richmond-based company's bankruptcy reorganization plan to challenge the plan to compensate about 195,000 women who claimed injuries from the intrauterine device marketed by the company in the early 1970s. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> attorney for more than 100 Dalkon Shield appellants, said the $ 2.5 billion trust fund to pay claimants is inadequate. He said full payment of claims could cost as much as $ 7 billion. But the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the appeal may cause some Dalkon claimants to wonder if they will ever get paid. `` I'm worried mostly that women will lose heart,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>. `` There have been so many delays. It's very difficult for them to understand.'' More than 94 percent of the claimants voted in favor of the reorganization plan, confirmed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. But about 900 women had rejected the plan, which was upheld in June by the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, lead attorney for opponents of the reorganization, said his clients object to the plan's prohibition on the filing of separate lawsuits against <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' corporate officers and other third parties. But Ms. <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> and company officials said the appeal will only cause further delays. `` While I understand their reasoning it's very difficult to explain when we have a good plan and most of these women have already waited 18 years,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> said by telephone from her home in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` I'm very upset by it because it means a delay to all of the women.'' <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Puckett </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the company also regretted the appeal because it would delay compensation to claimants. <PERSON> Puckett </PERSON> has said the trust could have been funded by Sept. 28 if no further appeals had been filed. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> has until Oct. 16 to file a response to the appeal with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, after which the court will decide whether to review the case. The reorganization plan was worked out over a three-year period after <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> sought Chapter 11 protection from creditors in August 1985. The reorganization plan also included the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION>, through a $ 700 million exchange of stock, by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> filed for protection, the company had settled about two-thirds of approximately 15,000 lawsuits brought by women who alleged injuries ranging from infections to sterility to miscarriage from using the IUD. Under the reorganization plan, the $ 2.5 billion fund to pay <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> claims will be administered by trustees independent of <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>. The plan also includes full payment to <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' other creditors. Pending a resolution of appeals, only $ 100 million of the trust has been available to settle claims. As of this week, $ 52.8 million had been paid to settle more than 81,000 claims, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a spokesman for the trust.

 Brain scans can reveal a shrinkage in some tissue that may be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease, even in people not yet diagnosed, a new study suggests. The shrinkage appeared more frequently in Alzheimer's patients and in people who were later diagnosed with the disease than in other people, researchers reported. If further research confirms the result, scanning for the abnormality may be useful as one step in diagnosing the disease, study co-author <PERSON> Mony </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLeon </PERSON> said Thursday. The work is reported in Saturday's issue of <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lancet </LOCATION>, a British medical journal, by <PERSON> DeLeon </PERSON> and colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition that attacks the brain and impairs thinking, memory and behavior. It affects an estimated 2.5 million American adults. No cause or cure is known. Researchers used a procedure involving computerized tomography, an X-ray technique commonly called CT scanning, to study a portion of the brain called the hippocampus. They examined 76 patients with mild to severe Alzheimer's, 27 with minimal age-related memory changes, and 72 normal volunteers, all with an average age in their early 70's. Shrinkage in the hippocampus appeared in 87 percent of the Alzheimer's group and 70 percent of those with mild memory impairment, compared to 22 percent of the normal volunteers. Researchers also followed 20 patients with mild memory impairment and 28 healthy people of similar ages. By three years later, 11 of the subjects were diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Ten of them had shown shrinkage in the hippocampus in the initial examination. Of the 37 people not diagnosed with Alzheimer's by three years later, only seven had shown the hippocampus abnormality. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> said results suggest the abnormality may help in diagnosis of Alzheimer's, but because it also appears in normal people it can not be used by itself. <PERSON> DeLeon </PERSON> said the people who were not diagnosed with Alzheimer's within three years may be at risk for developing outward symptoms later

<HEAD>Ag Department Defends Plan to Boost Wheat Plantings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Commodity analysts in the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> believe wheat farmers wo n't go overboard in signing up for a new option designed to boost 1990 production. The option announced this week by <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> would let a farmer boost plantings by as much as 10 percent from what otherwise would be allowed by the 1990 program. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said the increase is needed to help rebuild <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food stockpiles, including a special `` food security reserve'' to meet global food aid requirements. But some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> fear production might rise more sharply than <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> projects and push down market prices. And the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> has reservations about the plan. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON>, assistant deputy administrator for state and county operations in the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the program contains `` some down sides'' that could discourage wheat farmers from planting too much wheat. The 1990 wheat program without the option calls for farmers to idle 5 percent of their base acreage to qualify for price support benefits. This `` acreage reserve'' program feature means farmers can plant wheat on 95 percent of their base. With the option announced by <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, producers can sign up to plant wheat on more than 95 percent of their land _ up to 105 percent, or 10 percent more than they otherwise would be permitted under the basic 1990 program. But <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> noted for `` every acre that you go over your normal -LRB- base -RRB-, you take an acre cut in the acres eligible for payment'' under the program's target-price formula. Another dampener, he said Thursday in a telephone interview, is that the additional acres will not be counted as planting history for the purpose of adjusting wheat bases in the future. `` So, if you plant 101 percent, you're not going to get credit for that 1 percent as wheat for the purpose of calculating the base for next year,'' <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> said. The signup for 1990 commodity programs will be held January 16 through April 13 at county <ORGANIZATION> ASCS </ORGANIZATION> offices, <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> said. Farmers will be able to decide then whether to participate in the optional wheat program. Meanwhile, wheat-state congressmen said the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision could weaken prices and hurt producers in some regions. Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, R-Kan., whose state is the leading wheat producer, said the move could send farmers `` back down the road of low prices and overproduction. Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Ore., complained `` now is not the time to gamble with wheat farmers' income. Although the nation's wheat stockpiles have dropped because of two years of drought, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> was overreacting to the lower inventories. `` It's risky, very risky,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` If increased crops do not result in a significant price drop, then wheat farmers might benefit. But that's assuming a lot. Basic laws of supply and demand would dictate that the price could fall.'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> option would come too late for some winter wheat producers to alter their planting preparations, especially if they had grown fall-harvested grain sorghum or soybeans after their wheat crop failed earlier this year because of drought. Farmer are planting winter wheat now for harvest next year. It accounts for about three-fourths of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat total. `` Change for the sake of change to this degree is just going to confuse farmers and irritate them, to say the least. And it's done just that,'' said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat carryover at the beginning of the current marketing year on June 1 was about 694 million bushels, down from 1.261 billion bushels on June 1, 1988, and 1.821 billion bushels on June 1, 1987. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> projections, the carryover may be down to 494 million bushels by next June 1. Despite a larger harvest this year, demand for wheat continues to outstrip production. Department analysts say the 1990 option is expected to boost the acreage for harvest by 2.1 million acres to an estimated 69.6 million acres. As a result, they say, the 1990 harvest would rise only 66 million bushels to 2.596 billion bushels. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> was less critical of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announcement, but association president <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyckoff </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export efforts should be stepped up if plantings increase. Producers `` want to be assured that they wo n't be caught holding a mountain of surplus grain if this experiment fails,'' <PERSON> Wyckoff </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Genoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, wheat farmer, said in a statement issued by the association's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office.

 Hundreds of East German refugees have driven into this country in a cloud of pollution from their tiny, exhaust-belching cars. The East German Trabants have two cylinders and run on a mixture of gasoline and oil. The cars do not meet <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s strict emission control laws, and the environmental Green party says one should be put in a museum with a sign: `` Forest Killer'' and the rest sent to the scrap heap. West German transportation officials have been issuing special permits to allow the East Germans to drive the rickety plastic-and-fiberglass cars. But the <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> object to a plan by the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to give wholesale exemptions to the new drivers. Instead, they say the government should hand out annual federal railway passes, worth about $ 4,000 each, in exchange for the Trabants. `` We're going to have to come up with some imaginative solutions to this problem,'' said <PERSON> Erhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jauck </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Bavarian <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. East Germans typically wait more than 11 years for a Trabant and more than 14 years for the larger <ORGANIZATION> Wartburg </ORGANIZATION> sedans some refugees drive. But after they become established in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, most refugees probably will get rid of their cars. Some will do so for reasons other than pollution, however. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> is surrounded by East German territory, and many of the refugees who want to settle in the city are reluctant to drive their car _ which still carry East German license plates _ 70 miles across their homeland to reach <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The high school dropout rate for Hispanics is nearing `` a national tragedy,'' says Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> who points to a new study showing dropout rates for other students have fallen in the last decade. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said the study released Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> disputes the popular perception that overall dropout rates have been rising. But he said statistics on Hispanics are troubling because they show one-third of all Hispanics aged 16 to 24 were not enrolled in school and were not high school graduates last year. The report, `` Dropout Rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>: 1988,'' showed 4.4 percent of students in grades 10 through 12 dropped out of high school annually in the years 1985-1988, down from 6.6 percent in 1978. Nearly 13 percent of all 16 - to 24-year-olds were not in school and had not completed school last year, down from 16 percent in 1968 `` While the report shows some progress,'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said, `` I find much in it alarming. The nation can not rest any easier based upon our findings. `` As of 1988, 4.2 million young adults were without a high school diploma. While overall rates may be down slightly, ... for our Hispanic population, the dropout problem is a national tragedy. One-third of Hispanic young adults were not high school graduates in 1988,'' said <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, the first Hispanic to head the department. Overall, the dropout rates were 15 percent for whites, 22 percent for blacks and 28 percent for Hispanics. The majority of dropouts are whites, who accounted for 66 percent of all young adults without diplomas. The dropout rates for American Indians and Alaskan natives were 35 percent, while those for <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> students were 8 percent. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said the `` glimmer of hope in the report is that the disparity between white and black students has narrowed.'' The report showed dropout rates for whites and blacks are similar when individual and family backgrounds are taken into account, such as the rates for blacks and whites living in central cities and those living in suburbs. The center tracked a sample of students who were high school sophomores in 1980 and found 17 percent had not graduated by 1982. However, 46 percent of these dropouts had completed school by 1986. The study was required by the <ORGANIZATION> Hawkins-Stafford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secondary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Improvement Amendments of 1988.

 Six topics will claim the attention of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the nation's governors later this month at an education summit that seeks to keep the school reform movement from going `` the way of the hula hoop, twist and the Edsel.'' <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> outlined the tentative agenda for the summit Thursday and said the meetings slated for Sept. 27-28 in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, must result in agreement on what children should know before graduation. National performance targets or goals are essential to `` sustain this education reform movement'' that started with the government's 1983 `` Nation at Risk'' report, which alerted the country to schools' academic failures, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> told reporters `` I wake up at night with a bad dream that the education reform movement will go the way of the hula hoop, twist and the Edsel,'' he said. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, a Democrat, met with <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials Wednesday, along with <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, to discuss the agenda and other details of the summit. Talks will focus on six topics that `` are broad enough to embrace everything we need to discuss,'' <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said. The remaining dispute is whether the meetings will be open. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said the issues will include `` teaching as a profession''; the learning environment of children, including the special needs of the disadvantaged and drug-free schools; restructuring schools, including ways to give parents and children more options; `` lifelong learning,'' including adult literacy, vocational and on-the-job training; higher education; and the responsibilities of the various levels of government. `` I think it will be very interesting to see what will come out of this in terms of specifics,'' said <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>. `` But I would n't minimize the importance of having a national set of performance goals which the president embraces. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said he had not spoken to all of the governors about setting national goals. But he said the idea `` has consistently been our policy and I have no reason to believe they are n't'' in favor of that approach. The White House officials, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said, were `` pretty positive.'' The <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> governor also is pushing to keep most of the summit sessions open. Responding to reports that some governors are upset that the working meetings will be closed, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the governors told the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> they wanted it that way `` so they were free to tell -LRB- the president -RRB- what they really thought.'' `` The only sessions that are closed are the working sessions and I think they prefer them that way,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> promised ample media access to the plenary sessions and `` press conferences back-to-back every minute of the morning.''

<TEXT>
 Pentagon officials and the manufacturer of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s new $ 1.2 billion destroyer are disputing charges the ship is a `` procurement nightmare'' of cost overruns and schedule delays. `` The ship is ready in every respect to be launched,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haggett </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Bath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. <PERSON> Haggett </PERSON> spoke after Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on oversight and investigations, wrote the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> complaining the program is 18 months behind schedule and the DDG-51 destroyer that Bath Iron Works will launch Saturday is only 38 percent complete `` The ship has suffered huge overruns, with the design costs increasing by about 120 percent; and construction costs have increased by more than 60 percent,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said in a Sept. 12 letter to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Hailed as the world's most advanced surface combat ship, the guided-missile destroyer is designed with a more expensive all-steel superstructure instead of one that was part aluminum and more prone to splintering and fire damage. It will be equipped with sophisticated Aegis computers and Tomahawk cruise missiles. According to <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s letter, design costs have increased from the original contract estimate of $ 111 million to $ 247 million and construction costs have grown from $ 157 million to $ 252 million. A total of 760 change orders have been made, he said. One involved the combat system and included 44 modifications to the original ship design requiring revisions to 30 to 40 percent of the ship's drawings. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> based his charges on a draft report from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which is conducting an inquiry into the program. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s final report is expected later this year. `` The acquisition of the DDG-51 has turned into a procurement nightmare,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said in the letter. <PERSON> Haggett </PERSON> called <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s assessment a `` distortion of the overall picture on the destroyer program'' and `` factually incorrect.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the service `` considers the program well under control in both cost and schedule.'' `` This launching represents the normal progression in the construction, equipment activation and test plan. The remaining work on the ship requires the ship to be afloat,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in a statement. According to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the production schedule calls for the ship to be delivered in February 1991. The original delivery date of October 1989 was changed due to a 99-day strike at Bath Iron Works in 1985, a requirement of additional <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> testing of the combat system and problems with computer-aided design. <PERSON> Haggett </PERSON> said the DDG-51 is `` 47 to 51 percent complete, a higher level than we launched our previous prototype ship.'' He disputed <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s total of 760 change orders, saying the actual number is less than 300. <PERSON> Haggett </PERSON> also questioned <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s claim that the company has petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for an $ 85 million bailout or threatened to go bankrupt. `` We repeatedly told the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> that this company is financially viable,'' <PERSON> Haggett </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from Bath, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> also said Bath Iron Works, despite four years of work on the design and construction of the destroyer, still has not supplied the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> with a validated design and production drawings. `` The design is in excellent condition. We have over 3,000 drawings,'' <PERSON> Haggett </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical materials, played down the charges raised by <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> `` I do n't see anything very scandalous,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It still will be the best ship of its class in the world.''

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> last year made a record 38,000 drug seizures and convicted a record 30,500 offenders, Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. The $ 13 million worth of drugs seized last year is nearly seven times the $ 2 million total in 1987. <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said 94 percent of the increase was attributed to marijuana seizures. The 700 pounds of cocaine seized last year is three times higher than the 1986 level, although lower than the nearly 900 pounds seized in 1987. `` This ... confirms the need for our action to choke off the supply of this drug while maintaining our efforts to reduce demand for it, particularly in the form of crack,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. The number of drug seizures in 1988 was 25 percent higher than in 1987, and the number of convictions for drug offenses was 16 percent higher.

<TEXT>
 Here, at a glance, are some of the major provisions of the bill approved late Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CAPITAL GAINS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 The bill would reduce the maximum tax rate on profits from the selling of capital assets, such as real estate and stocks. Through the end of 1991, the current 33 percent top rate would be reduced to 19.6 percent. The rate would then be raised to 28 percent and the basis of assets `` indexed'' so that profit caused entirely by inflation would not be taxed. The change is expected to bring the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> additional revenue in the next three fiscal years _ $ 2.9 billion in fiscal 1990, $ 3.8 billion in fiscal 1991, and $ 2.7 billion in fiscal 1992 _ as people take advantage of the lower rate and increase their capital activity. After the initial increase, the government's intake would drop sharply with losses of more than $ 5 billion projected for fiscal years 1993 and 1994.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CATASTROPHIC HEALTH</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 In response to complaints from the elderly, the bill would cut in half the surtax paid by the wealthiest 40 percent of retirees and increase the flat monthly catastrophic premium paid by all but the poorest <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries. The bill would allow retirees to turn down catastrophic coverage _ but only if they opt to drop out of Medicare Part B, the program which pays physicians' fees. Aside from the catastrophic coverage, the bill would restrain scheduled increases in payments to providers of Medicare services, a spending cut of about $ 2.7 billion. It also would increase to $ 10,440 by 1991 the amount that a Social Security recipient may earn without having benefits reduced.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CHILD CARE</NOTE>

 An additional $ 16 billion in tax credits and state-administered grants would be provided to lower-income families over the next five years to help improve child care for working parents. The major change would liberalize the earned-income credit, which benefits lower-income working families with children. The credit would be worth more to larger families; it could range up to $ 1,790 a year for those with three or more children. A new credit of up to $ 430 a year would help families with children under the age of 6.

 The bill includes about $ 6.3 billion in net revenue increase for fiscal 1990, including the capital gains cut. Significant among the others are repeal the completed-contract method of accounting, by which big defense contractors may defer taxes; eliminate special tax benefits for banks that lend money to Employee Stock Ownership Plans, and end an interest break on big banks' large loans to developing countries. The bill would also require companies to more quickly give the government the payroll taxes they withhold from employees. The bill would effectively repeal a 1986 tax law provision, known as Section 89, aimed at ensuring that employer-financed health plans do not discriminate in favor of higher-paid employees. Businesses contended compliance with the law was an onerous burden. An amendment approved Thursday would extend the 25 percent deduction for health insurance premiums paid by self-employed workers, which was due to expire this year. That extension was tied a measure that would restrict refunds of interest deductions related to leveraged buy-outs.

<HEAD>Congressional Black Caucus Celebrates its Success</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Black members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ who in 20 years have moved from outsiders demanding black power to insiders wielding it _ are celebrating their successes this week while considering how best to use a $ 2 million war chest. The money, much of it raised from corporate donors, was not on the formal agenda for the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>' annual `` Legislative Weekend'' that opened Thursday and runs through Saturday night. But it was a matter of behind-the-scenes debate among the 23 blacks who are members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, as they were joined by thousands of black political elite from around the country for the gala fund-raiser, social event and policy discussion. Rep. <PERSON> Kweisi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mfume </PERSON>, a second-term Democrat representing <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, who adopted an African name, said the 23 black members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are considering several proposals for spending the money. Among them are to establish a think tank doing black-oriented research, a recruitment center aimed at developing black political candidates, and even a computerized library on African-American culture. `` We ought to make ourselves more effective'' with the money, <PERSON> Mfume </PERSON> said. A $ 300-a-plate black-tie dinner Saturday night is expected to attract 4,000 guests, and more than 20,000 people will participate in related events, including a black fashion show and numerous parties. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> is hosting the three-day session at a time when black political leaders have successes to celebrate, such as the victory in Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> mayoral primary of black candidate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, and the candidacy in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, who seeks to become the first black elected governor. Blacks in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are enjoying unprecedented power, too. Much of it is the result of advances through the seniority system that awards power to the most veteran members _ the same system that once benefited white Southern conservatives who were re-elected with little opposition time after time. Their numbers have grown since the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> was formed in 1970, when there were 13 members. But more importantly, caucus members now hold the chairmanships of five House committees and 18 subcommittees, and young black newcomers are working their way up some of the most influential congressional committees. `` The staying power of their members and the number of chairmanships that they have make them an effective force,'' said former Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, who is white. One member, Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., has leapfrogged ahead, serving last term as <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman and winning the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats' No 3 leadership position this year as majority whip. The rise in power is limited to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, however. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has no black members. The number of blacks in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has at least temporarily declined with the death in an African plane crash last month of Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> was mourned at several of the caucus' opening events President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> earlier this year hosted the caucus at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ its first invitation there in eight years. In addition to the chance to discuss issues, members estimate this year's Legislative Weekend event will raise $ 1 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a legally separate entity with interlocking board members. With corporations donating sums of $ 50,000 in some cases, income in recent years has exceeded spending on fellowships, internships and scholarships, allowing the foundation to purchase its own building and to accumulate a reserve of just over $ 2 million, according to foundation financial records for the year ending Dec. 31, 1988. Another issue under debate by black members involves whether the caucus should continue accepting large contributions to the foundation from tobacco companies and liquor manufacturers, which some members feel are contributing to health problems within the black community. The caucus lists companies including <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION>, Courvoisier Cognac VSOP, <ORGANIZATION> Stroh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewery </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> among its major contributors.

<HEAD>Broadcasters Oppose ESPN Exclusive Baseball Contract</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Broadcasters are taking aim at the <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> cable network in a new campaign to preserve free, over-the-air televised sports. Viewers `` are getting something now for free that in the future, if the tide goes the way it has, they are going to have to pay for,'' says <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkery </PERSON>, an executive of <ORGANIZATION> WSBK-TV </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year snagged a four-year, $ 400 million contract with <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baseball </ORGANIZATION> to carry games on Wednesday and Sunday nights. Outraged broadcasters were shut out, and they said Thursday they are going to fight _ on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> if necessary. Television executives from stations with baseball broadcast rights in 24 of the 26 <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baseball </ORGANIZATION> cities said they will meet with <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> and major league officials to demand access to Wednesday and Sunday games, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrao </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION>. `` An immediate effort will be made to seek the elimination of the exclusive restrictions on the Wednesday and Sunday night blackouts,'' <PERSON> Serrao </PERSON> said. `` These blackouts on free, over-the-air TV are contrary to the public interest.'' Local TV stations that already had contracted with individual baseball teams to carry a certain number of games during the season now have no access to Wednesdays and Sundays, the station executives said. Meanwhile, regional cable sports networks can show the games, the executives said. Local broadcasters have no legal recourse because <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baseball </ORGANIZATION> agreements supersede contracts made by individual teams, <PERSON> Berkery </PERSON> said. The same situation applies when college athletic conferences such as the Big 10 and <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> 10 make cable agreements that override contracts between individual schools and local broadcasters, <ORGANIZATION> INTV </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Padden </PERSON> said. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were out of the office and not available for comment Thursday. But the <ORGANIZATION> NCTA </ORGANIZATION> has said that local broadcasters are showing 40 percent more professional baseball games now than in 1975, and that cable is not siphoning away free TV sports. Major League Baseball spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, reached by telephone in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> where team owners are meeting, would not comment on the broadcasters' allegations. The broadcasters said they will urge <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to hold hearings `` to investigate the alarming siphoning of sports from free, over-the-air television.'' They said they were given assurances in meetings with Sens. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., that their concerns will be heard on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> told the broadcasters he will seek hearings this fall on his bill to reregulate the cable TV industry and on other cable TV bills now pending, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Marla </PERSON> <PERSON> Romash </PERSON> said later. `` One of Senator <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s concerns is the flight of athletics from free TV to pay TV,'' <PERSON> Romash </PERSON> said, noting that there is no pending legislation that specifically addresses that issue. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> is on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> antitrust, monopolies and business rights subcommittee. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, executive assistant to Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, chairman of the communications subcommittee, said, `` I do n't see a stand-alone -LRB- sports -RRB- hearing, but certainly during the cable oversight hearings you're bound to get some hard questioning on the migration of sports.''

<BYLINE>Critics Say Federal Study Denies Many Diabetics ^By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government study in which expensive orthopedic shoes will be bought for some diabetic Medicare patients but not others is being criticized for jeopardizing health in the name of medical economics. `` I consider it morally reprehensible'' to not provide the shoes to some diabetics at high risk of foot amputations, said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Matek </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Podiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. But project staff members say no one is being denied anything. Rather, some Medicare recipients are getting something extra and that the benefits of the study will reach all such patients, they say. Under the study that began last month, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> is choosing 27,000 diabetic patients in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> who have a high risk of hospitalization or amputation because of circulatory problems in their feet. Half will be reimbursed for up to $ 305 for a pair of therapeutic shoes or inserts, but the other half will not, though they can still buy the footwear. The idea is to determine if the government would save money in the long run by providing shoes to such patients. About 20,000 diabetics each year have parts of their legs and feet removed. Many experts say specially-fitted shoes have been shown to prevent the problems that lead to amputations. <PERSON> Matek </PERSON> said he finds it `` morally unacceptable to deny a recognizably beneficial intervention to one out of every two people at high risk for amputation.'' And he says since Medicare patients in the study who are not reimbursed can still buy the shoes, there's no point in doing a cost-effectiveness comparison. But <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Wooldridge </PERSON>, project director at <LOCATION> Mathematica </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, health policy study group commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to do the study, dismisses the ethical concerns as illogical. `` They interpret it as someone being denied something. But no one is going to be denied anything. Some are going to receive something extra,'' she said. The legislation that called for the study says the benefit will not go into effect if the study shows money would not be saved in the long run by paying for the shoes. <PERSON> Wooldridge </PERSON> and others in all likelihood therapeutic footwear for diabetics will become a covered <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> benefit, at least by 1993. The bill originally made the shoes a covered benefit but got caught in the budget squeeze after the stock market crash in October 1987. Backers in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> compromised to save the bill by calling for a study to verify claims it would save $ 25 million a year by avoiding costly hospitalizations and amputations. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Trieger </PERSON>, director of the division of health systems and special studies in <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION>'s office of demonstrations, said, `` when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> says do a demonstration, that means there will be certain people who get the benefit and certain people who do n't.'' About 2,500 podiatrists and other physicians in the three states have expressed willingness to participate so far. Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Meritt </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, podiatrist who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Podiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he will participate in the study, though he is concerned patients who need the shoes will hold off buying them until they find out whether <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> will pay for them. `` I'm going to recommend that they get the shoe'' regardless of whether the government will pay, he said. `` I do n't want my patients waiting on the government. That could be hazardous, and that concerns me.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to give states almost $ 500 million to fight drugs will result in a net loss of federal dollars in 22 states because of offsetting cuts in related programs, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> study group says. `` Each of the programs -LRB- being cut -RRB- deals in one way or another with conditions in society which many experts argue are direct contributing causes of drug abuse,'' the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday The group measured the total <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would like to give states for law enforcement and prevention and treatment against losses in programs for immigration, economic development and juvenile justice. According to the group, 43 states would lose federal assistance equal to more than half their new drug fund allocation under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan. Of those states, 22 would have losses exceeding estimated gains, as would the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territories, the study said. The worst losses would be in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where cuts would equal nearly four times the amount of money received under the drug plan _ a net loss of $ 150 million. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, cuts are expected to be twice as much, for a net loss of $ 25.5 million, the study said. And in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> the cuts are expected to take about 70 percent more out of the budget than the proposed new funding will put in, for a net loss of $ 1.1 million, the study said. For the states, <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and the territories, the total new spending is supposed to be $ 449 million under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan, but the cuts in such programs as immigration, juvenile justice and economic development will total $ 557 million, for a net loss of $ 108 million, the study said. The study did not count the $ 50 million in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for public housing programs because it comes out of an account already earmarked for public housing. The funding request covers the 1990 fiscal year.

 The police chief of this city added his voice to nationwide calls for a ban on assault weapons after a man using an AK-47 rifle shot 20 former co-workers at a printing plant before killing himself. `` You do n't need these kinds of weapons unless you're a police officer or a criminal,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> said at a news conference where he held up the AK-47 and one of the two MAC-11 semiautomatic machine pistols used in Thursday's rampage. The gunman, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>, committed suicide after killing seven and wounding 13 workers at the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gravure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> where he worked until a year ago. `` What do you need these for _ except for killing people?'' <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> said. Police said <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> also was armed with a .38 - caliber handgun, a 9mm Sig-Sauer pistol, and a bayonet that apparently fit the He carried several thousand rounds of ammunition. `` You've got to wonder whether these assault rifles ... should be banned from the ability to purchase them within the confines of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON>, who was given a tour through the carnage by police. `` I saw people in excruciating pain, with bodies strewn throughout the three floors. The scene was like a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> or World War II.'' A lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged the massacre would put the organization in a more guarded position as it attempts to deflect legislation to ban assault-style weapons. `` Any time there's a tragedy of this degree it's going to require us to be responsive to increased concerns, but the bottom line issue is the same: Would a gun law have stopped this kind of thing?'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the lobbyist. `` We do n't think so.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration imposed an import ban on assault-type rifles in July, but the ban did n't affect guns already owned by Americans or similar weapons produced by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in May became the first state to enact restrictions on the possession or sale of the guns. The law was prompted by the shooting of 35 people at a <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, schoolyard by a gunman with an AK-47. `` How many more <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> massacres must happen before our lawmakers have the courage to stand up to the gun lobby?'' said <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, chairwoman of the national <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> lobbying group. `` My heart goes out to the families of the victims of this horrible tragedy in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>,'' she said in a news release. `` It's too late for them, but we can prevent further massacres involving assault weapons if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will approve pending legislation. Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s husband, former White House press secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, was seriously injured in the 1981 assassination attempt on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Gun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, said laws regulating the sale of assault weapons such as the Soviet-designed AK-47 are `` just about the same as it is in any state. It's the same as buying a shotgun or any other type of rifle.'' He said a customer wanting to purchase an AK-47 would have to present a valid driver's license and fill out a federal form. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has approved a measure that would ban nine varieties of semiautomatic assault-style weapons, five already covered by the administration's import ban and four others produced domestically. While providing up to 10 years additional prison time for those convicted of crimes involving firearms, the law would go off the books in three years under a `` sunset'' provision.

<TEXT>
 House Democrats are gearing up for another battle with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over the minimum wage, offering to accept his $ 4.25 hourly floor but refusing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for a lower pay scale for all new hires. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s labor standards subcommittee on Thursday approved on a 7-4, party-line vote a plan to raise the $ 3.35-an-hour wage floor by 45 cents this January and by another 45 cents in January 1991. But the panel refused to expand provisions in a bill vetoed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in June that would allow employers to continue paying a $ 3.35 minimum only to people beginning their first job and only for the first 60 days of their employment. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he would veto the bill again if it phases in the increase to $ 4.25 in less than three years. He also insists that a lower `` training wage'' be allowed for six months for any person newly hired, regardless of their previous work experience. Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said in a letter to the panel Wednesday to that the compromise offer put together by Chairman <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, D-Pa., with support from the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> `` continues to be unacceptable to the president, and would call for a veto. Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petri </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, the subcommittee's ranking Republican, said minimum wage advocates should accept the proposal <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered in March `` and declare a victory.'' Otherwise, said Rep. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, there will only be `` continued deadlock.'' Democrats, however, said the only concession they were willing to make was reducing to $ 4.25 the $ 4.55 minimum in the bill that passed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last spring and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed. `` I'm not moving back one step further,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, D-Ky., noting the minimum wage has been frozen at $ 3.35 since 1981 `` I've seen too much given away for the sake of people who do n't care. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` is not so much interested in the legislation than he is trying to prove a point, and that saddens me.'' On a 6-5 vote, with <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> breaking away from his fellow Democrats, the panel rejected an amendment by <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> to remove overtime or minimum wage exemptions for some 30 different classifications of workers. Among the exemptions _ which have worked their way into the law over the past 50 years _ are fishermen, tobacco strippers, amusement park workers, employees of newspapers with less than 4,000 circulation, radio and TV announcers in cities of less than 100,000, laundry workers and domestic maids. While the idea intrigued many more Democrats, Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., the full committee's chairman, called <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>'s proposal a `` killer'' amendment that would erode support for the The Education and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to take up the legislation next Tuesday. Just before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recessed in August, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> reapproved without change the bill that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed in June. But <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, has said he is willing to change it on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor to accommodate the House's action or if a compromise can be struck with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s youngsters are suffering an `` ominous'' decline in cardiovascular health from poor eating habits, inadequate physical training at school and their growing preference for video games over the playground variety, according to a decade-long study. An annual random sampling from the millions of boys and girls who participated in the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund-Amateur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s fitness testing program shows a 10 percent decline in average scores for distance runs _ the component measuring aerobic endurance, or heart and lung strength. And, in the same 1980-89 period, there was also a major dropoff, from 43 percent to 32 percent, in those who achieved at least `` satisfactory'' scores in the entire test, despite some improvement in muscular strength. `` We've really got a problem here,'' said <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Updyke </PERSON>, director of the Chrysler-sponsored <ORGANIZATION> AAU </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fitness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, which now enrolls 9.7 million youngsters aged 6 to 17. `` The cardiovascular trend is ominous, based on what we know about the link between heart disease and inactivity and nutritional bad habits,'' he said. At a news conference, <PERSON> Updyke </PERSON>, an associate dean at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, cited a variety of causes for the poorer aerobic showings, including less emphasis on physical training in the schools. Only one state, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, now requires physical education for children in all grades, he noted. And `` technology, at best, has been a mixed blessing,'' he said, because `` kids are saving their competitive instincts for <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> and other computer games instead of kick-the-can and other physical activity.'' The program's printed report, based on a sample of 12,000 youngsters whose test scores were picked at random each year, also applied the word `` ominous'' to the creeping weight gain observed for most age groups over the decade. Children of all school ages, 6 to 17, were measured by the tests. There was no perceptible increase in height for the various age groups, so the weight gains were attributed to poor dietary and physical habits, it said. For example, girls aged 12 and 13 averaged 61.5 inches in height in both 1980 and 1989, but they were 9.2 pounds heavier, at 112, this year. Boys aged 14-17 actually were more than an inch shorter, on average, this year _ at 5 feet 7 -LCB- _ but weighed nearly five pounds more, at 142. The program involves a battery of AAU tests dating to 1943, though the report released Thursday was the first decade-long study based on annual testing. For all age brackets, it consisted of an endurance run, pullups -LRB- boys -RRB- or flexed arm hang -LRB- girls -RRB-, a `` sit and reach'' test for flexibility, regular situps and one of five optional events to demonstrate motor skills _ long jump, sprint, shuttle run, modified pushup, isometric pushup or isometric squat. The report said `` the best investment parents can make in the physical fitness of their children is to insist on high quality physical education programs in their schools.'' <PERSON> Updyke </PERSON> rejected the notion that more time in the gym or on the playground would cut into academic opportunities for children. `` Fitness makes you a greater accountant, a greater president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a better anything,'' he said.

 Opponents of the planned resettlement of the <LOCATION> Love </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> neighborhood mostly cite health concerns, but they also do n't want to lose a national symbol of an environmental disaster, an activist said. Eleven years after officials evacuated hundreds of families from the <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> neighborhood when chemicals from a dump seeped into homes, state health officials say people can move back into the area after years of cleanup. Resettlement opponents, however, question whether the neighborhood is safe. Hundreds of environmentalists and religious activists plan to attend a rally in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> tonight in hopes of persuading Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> to stop the planned resettlement. <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, the former Love Canal homemaker who became well-known in the environmental movement after leading her former neighbors in a fight for federal assistance, said she also does n't want to lose Love Canal's symbolic value. `` By making it habitable, it steals away the symbol from the people,'' <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said in an interview this week. `` Love Canal is a symbol for problems across the country.'' `` Anywhere I go in the country ... regardless of what people are fighting, they refer to the damage created by that particular facility as Love Canal,'' said <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, who now works for the Virginia-based Citizens Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste. She is an organizer for today's rally. Last fall, Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON>, the state health commissioner, ruled that two-thirds of the <LOCATION> Love </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> neighborhood was suitable for resettlement after years of work to contain or treat the toxic contamination from the dump site. Resettlement of the homes is scheduled for next year. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the former <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> which used Love Canal as a waste dump, acknowledges that 20,000 tons of chemical wastes were dumped there in the 1940s and 1950s. The dump was covered and the <ORGANIZATION> Niagara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> bought the land and built a school and playground there. Developers built hundreds of homes nearby during the 1960s. Foul odors and oozing chemicals were the first signs for residents that something was wrong. The chemical contamination remains in a giant fenced mound at the center of the neighborhood. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on today's rally. Today, about 70 homes in Love Canal are occupied by people who chose not to leave when the neighborhood was declared a federal emergency area in 1978. But the overriding image of the neighborhood is one of block after block of bulldozed lawns and boarded-up tract homes. The current residents hope that <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> wo n't stop the resettlement. `` We pray that this demonstration will not sway you or your agencies' progress toward the remediation and resettlement of this area,'' said a letter from a residents' group. <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON>'s conclusion was based on studies comparing levels of toxics with those found in other areas of <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. `` Based on what we know, people would not be exposed to any higher risk there than they would be elsewhere in the greater <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> community,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Slocum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON>'s spokesman. A potential sticking point, however, is that scientists used a `` comparison standard'' for certain chemical levels in the neighborhood `` because we do n't have a better standard,'' <PERSON> Slocum </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> and others fear that the levels used for comparison in Love Canal will set a precedent. `` If they let people back in with those levels, then essentially they are legalizing those levels,'' said <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>. `` That's a precedent that we can not allow.''

 Misgivings about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> have surfaced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in anticipation of the promised withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> country later this month. Several Congressmen accused the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration Thursday of taking a weak stand at the recent international conference on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> against return of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the communists accused of causing more than a million Cambodian deaths during their 1975-78 `` Killing Fields'' rule over <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` Given the moral consequences of failure _ given the possibility that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> may return ... if there was ever an issue in which consultation between the executive branch and <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> is an absolute necessity, this is the one,'' Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-NY </LOCATION>, told his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Asian-Pacific affairs subcommittee after a public hearing on the issue. Spectators were then cleared from the room to enable a senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official to clarify in closed session the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategy for blocking the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from returning to power. The official, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> affairs, during the public debate blasted as `` grossly unfair and inaccurate, implications that somehow we are trying to whitewash what happened during the 1970s'' in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said he would have to dig into the records of the failed <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conference last month in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to provide concrete evidence of the stand the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> took there against past <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Route </ORGANIZATION> genocide. He said tactics for future dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> could be explained only in closed session. The administration favors `` no role for the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in a future Cambodian government,'' but continues to support Cambodian Prince <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and his desire to remain allied with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in a four-party transition government, <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> testified. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed with <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> could be better controlled if they were inside the new regime, and that excluding them would be `` a sure formula'' for civil war once the Vietnamese leave. Rep. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, D-Mass., accused the administration of publicly condemning the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> but remaining silent and taking no action at working sessions He charged that the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> conference failed `` in large measure because the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and its international backers sought to expunge from all official records any acknowledgment of their acts of genocide,'' and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> acquiesced. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position meant that `` we are clinging to the outmoded policies and paranoia of the Vietnam War, but the war is over and the world has changed. We are not able by sheer force and strong will to create a <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government that is absolutely to our liking,'' <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said. `` If stopping the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> `` means taking a fresh, more reasoned assessment of the successes of the -LRB- Vietnam-installed -RRB- <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> government, then so be it.'' Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` does not have the luxury'' of avoiding such moral issues as <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> `` genocide.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> should be tried by an international court for war crimes. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> negotiations are in suspension and could be resumed if progress appears likely after six months of lower-level talks. He blamed failure to achieve a comprehensive settlement at <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, head of the Vietnamese-installed government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. They refused to compromise on <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s four-party formula and sought to retain the infrastructure of the <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> government, giving it unfair advantage in promised elections, he said. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> `` is not infallible ... he is capable of monumental misjudgment,'' <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said. He recalled that the prince's alliance with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in 1970 helped transform them from regional guerrillas into a force that later overthrew a U.S.-backed government.

<TEXT>
 The gloomy and suspicious view <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> had toward <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> lives on in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration 12 years after he stepped down as secretary of state and as the Cold War recedes. Hundreds of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear missiles are being junked, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> are veering away from Marxist orthodoxy without any apparent interference from the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, and next week the two superpowers may announce a landmark agreement to open their chemical weapons plants to each other. But before you break out the champagne and burn your blueprints for an air raid shelter, consider what <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, the deputy secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, had to say the other night at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. If he is right, the West had better keep its guard up. If he is wrong, Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could be getting a more cautious reception from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration than he deserves. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, a foreign service officer who was close to <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, has had more than 30 years of experience to sharpen his own perception of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance, which was created on the assumption <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> menaced the West. His speech suggests that good news can be bad news. Even as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> stakes out arms control agreements with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and grafts some touches of capitalism to his creaking economy, <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> finds cause for being anxious about the West's future. He reminded his audience that the Soviet leader is no anti-communist. `` He intends to make the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as strong as he possibly can,'' <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said. As <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> left <PERSON> Gunston </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, he found himself face-to-face with <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. They smiled and exchanged pleasantries. But the substance of <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>'s speech was mostly hard-line He found practical economic reasons for the cuts <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is making in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> weapons and for slowing `` overseas adventurism.'' And, <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> warned, `` herein lies a danger to Western interests _ that with the perception growing among the Western public that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> threat has diminished, there will be a tendency among the member states of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance to compete in expanding their relationships with the East.'' That, the senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official concluded, would be a mistake and the Europeans should know better. `` After all,'' <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said, `` the Europeans are condemned by geography to live in the shadow of Soviet military power whether or not the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the long run changes as much as all of us hope.'' <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, in his day, pursued as his primary foreign policy goal countering and hopefully shrinking Soviet influence in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and other regions where the two sides had not declared a halt to their dangerous rivalry. The advent of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in 1985 ushered in a period of economic and political reform. Soviet troops left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, barriers to emigration were lowered and a ban on intermediate-range nuclear missiles was reached with a card-carrying anti-communist, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> says until those changes take root it would be wise `` to avoid bankrolling merely cosmetic Soviet reforms or reach arms control agreements which undermine <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to deter aggression.'' It is not clear how pervasive this view is within the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> will meet next week in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, to make preparations for a superpower summit. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> is by no means suggesting summits are a bad idea. But he says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the allies should go slow in making deals with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` We are hearing it said we need to take measures to ensure the success of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms,'' the deputy secretary of state said. `` This, however, is not the task of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> foreign policy, nor should it be that of our Western partners. Our task, after all, is to devise policies which will serve our interests, whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> succeeds or fails.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the firing of a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> defense contractor will delay deployment of new <ORGANIZATION> Amraam </ORGANIZATION> air-to-air missiles and force the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to take parts from old missiles until a new supplier begins production. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it dropped <ORGANIZATION> Micronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brea </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, because of years of problems with an arming and safety device on air-to-air missiles. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> withdrew its inspectors from the <ORGANIZATION> Micronics </ORGANIZATION> plant near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and the government no longer will accept delivery of the safety and arming device, said Lt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's no evidence that the safety and arming device has caused any detrimental missile performance,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has a full inventory of missiles for its operational forces to compensate for an expected stop in deliveries of the safety and arming device.'' The devices will be produced by <ORGANIZATION> Raymond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, starting in 1991. The missile itself is built by the <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The troubled device will cause problems with the <ORGANIZATION> Amraam </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sparrow </PERSON> and Sidewinder missiles, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions The <ORGANIZATION> Amraam </ORGANIZATION> will not be installed aboard <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> F-15 and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> F-18 fighters until new parts are secured from another source, but production problems for the Sparrow and Sidewinder are expected to be relatively minor. The arming device, roughly comparable to the safety on a gun, is built into the missile's fuze to prevent premature firing of the missile. It also prevents explosions in accidents, such as dropping a warhead on a carrier deck, but allows the warhead to explode when it hits a target after being fired. Limited production of the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> missile began eight years ago, but as late as three years ago the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> disclosed it was not deploying the weapon because of several problems, including the arming device. In a `` tear-down'' inspection of the missile in mid-1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> found 2,694 defects. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was conducting a criminal investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Micronics </ORGANIZATION>, which was suspected of using a production process that does not yield the quality required by specifications for the arming device. The radar-guided <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> was designed for the F-14 fighter and is supposed to be able to hit targets 100 miles away.

<NOTE>FDA Poised To Approve Wider Distribution Of AIDS Drug</NOTE>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> sources say they expect a plan for wider distribution of a promising experimental AIDS drug known as DDI to be approved shortly. <ORGANIZATION> Bristol-Myers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which is licensed to manufacture the drug, has said it will distribute <ORGANIZATION> DDI </ORGANIZATION>, or dideoxyinosine, at no cost to AIDS patients when the next round of clinical trials begins later this month. Thus far, the drug has been available only to about 90 patients in phase one clinical trials, the initial safety studies. The company has asked the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to approve distribution of the drug to patients who do not qualify for the upcoming round of research trials, which will compare <ORGANIZATION> DDI </ORGANIZATION> to AZT, the only approved anti-AIDS drug. Patients who can not tolerate AZT would be ineligible for these trials. Scientists say <ORGANIZATION> DDI </ORGANIZATION> is less toxic and better tolerated by patients than is AZT. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Thursday no decision has been made on precisely who would be eligible to receive the drug, though one source said it would include certain patients outside clinical trials. Researchers say that like AZT, <ORGANIZATION> DDI </ORGANIZATION> appears to reduce replication of the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS and controls the disease by enabling the body to recover some ability to fight infection.

 Salvagers expect to stay offshore until winter recovering gold worth as much as $ 1 billion from a steamship that sank 132 years ago, an expedition spokesman said. Workers recently have begun raising gold bars and coins aboard the SS <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a paddle-wheel steamer that was traveling from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Sept. 12, 1857, when it sank during a hurricane. The wreck, about 200 miles off the coast in 8,000 feet of water, claimed 425 lives; 153 people survived. The golden booty includes fortunes made during the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gold Rush, said historian <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which located the wreck three years ago. The group has 106 investors, mostly from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON>, a project director for the expedition, called it the largest American treasure trove ever. `` It sure beats working for a living,'' he quipped via ship-to-shore telephone Thursday from aboard the recovery ship Arctic Discoverer, which has been at the salvage site since July. `` What was really fun was putting together the project. It's kind of scary to think beyond that.'' The <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was carrying a regular monthly shipment of gold from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mint </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> banks via the Isthmus of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The estimated three tons of gold would be valued at up to $ 450 million in today's prices. In addition, riches belonging to passengers returning East after making their fortunes in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> appear to have been aboard the ship, <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON> said. `` That billion-dollar estimate is probably the most frequently heard figure on the treasure's value,'' said shipwreck expert <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> of <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s Island. Historians originally believed the ship sank off <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, but research, based largely on newspaper accounts, led the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> group south. So far, about 500 pounds of gold has been recovered from the site, <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON> said. The gold is being brought to the surface by an underwater recovery vehicle equipped with video cameras and a high-precision robotic arm. Gold bars, one weighing 62 pounds, rare ` double eagle'' coins valued at up to $ 20,000 each, and gold coins made by private <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> mints and valued at up to $ 15,000 have been recovered, said <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the expedition. The expedition, which sailed out of <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, in July will stay at the site until winter. <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON> said the organizers believe they can recover all the gold from the site but said it will be later this month before they have a better idea as to how long that might take. Although the undisclosed location is a long way off the coast, the wreckage is not completely undisturbed. The salvagers have found both beer cans and garbage bags at the site, <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON> said.

 Federal mine safety officials were meeting with executives of the company that owns the <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> when an explosion and fire there killed 10 miners, an official said. The <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had been investigating safety procedures at the mine for two or three weeks prior to the blast, said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s nearby <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION> office. It was not known if the investigation had any bearing on Wednesday's methane gas explosion, about 1,000 feet underground in the <ORGANIZATION> Pyro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s mine at nearby <PERSON> Wheatcroft </PERSON>. It was the nation's worst mine disaster in five years. One miner said he and co-workers had feared a methane gas explosion for some time. The miner spoke on condition his name not be used. `` It could have been worse,'' he said. `` I expected it to be worse. It's the company's fault. It's the men's fault. It's everybody's involvement. `` We all had the same thought on our minds,'' he said. `` Somebody is going to drop the ball. We're just thankful _ it's horrible, it's awful _ that it was just 10 men `` We all thought that when it wiped out, it was going to be all of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Station </PERSON>,'' said the miner. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Calman </PERSON>, a spokesman for Pyro, said the company would have no comment until an investigation expected to take several weeks is completed. `` We want to find out what happened so we can take steps to make sure it does n't happen again,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Gorman </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. Autopsies on nine of 10 miners killed in the explosion indicated they `` lived minutes at the maximum, probably more like seconds,'' before succumbing to superheated gases and carbon monoxide that were products of the blast, the state medical examiner said Thursday Nine miners died at the scene of smoke inhalation and the 10th miner died a short time later at a hospital of carbon monoxide inhalation, Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said there was no evidence of any disabling injuries to anyone else at the mine, which employs 367 workers on three shifts. `` That indicates to me that the explosion caused a vast amount of carbon monoxide to be formed but not a huge concussive type of explosion,'' he said. The mine entrance remained closed and under guard Thursday. The accident claimed the highest death toll since 27 miners died in a <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> coal mine on Dec. 19, 1984, <PERSON> O'Gorman </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A special session of the Azerbiajan Supreme Soviet today discussed the ethnic conflict engulfing the ethnic Armenian enclave of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The extraordinary session also was to examine draft legislation on the <LOCATION> Transcaucasian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>'s sovereignty, citizenship and economic independence, the official news agency said. `` The situation in and around <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> has never been so tense and explosive as today,'' <PERSON> Arkady </PERSON> <PERSON> Volskiy </PERSON>, head of a special committee ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> to administer the affairs of the autonomous region, said in a television interview Thursday night. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said that for the first time, representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijan </ORGANIZATION> and other organizations were allowed to attend the special session. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a mountainous territory with a predominantly ethnic Armenian population and situated within <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, is the center of a bitter dispute between mainly Christian <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and predominantly Moslem <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. About 100 people have died in the ethnic strife over the past 18 months and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> is demanding that <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> reassert control over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and that direct rule by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> be halted. <PERSON> Volskiy </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was forced to assume control of the region because of the bloodshed. `` The state can not stay aside if blood is spilled,'' he said. On Thursday, the newspaper Pravda reported that a strike by <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> railroad workers to press demands for Azerbaijani control of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> cut vital fuel and other supplies to neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The situation was particularly threatening in northern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, where workers are trying to reconstruct cities devastated by the Dec. 7 earthquake that killed 25,000 people, Pravda said.

 A former nursing home aide charged with suffocating five patients said she was tempted to `` smash babies'' at a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> hospital where she later worked, her alleged co-conspirator testified. <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, the prosecution's key witness, continued her testimony Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in the trial of her former lover, <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. The trial resumes Monday. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, 25, is charged with five counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to murder in the 1987 deaths of female patients at Alpine Manor Nursing Home in Walker, a suburb of Grand Rapids. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, who has admitted helping <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> kill the patients, said she and <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> sometimes talked by telephone after <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> moved to her native <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, in July 1987 and began working at <LOCATION> Mother </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Frances </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> as a nurse's aide. `` She told me she liked walking past the nursery and she wanted to take one of -LRB- the babies -RRB- and smash it against the window,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> testified. `` I had to stop her somehow.'' Her statements were made out of the presence of the jury after the defense attorney objected. <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Burks </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Frances </PERSON>, said by telephone that there were no unusual occurrences or unexplained injuries at the hospital while <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> was employed there between July 1987 and October 1988. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> did n't have access to the nursery and was fired when the hospital found out she was being investigated in the Alpine Manor deaths, <PERSON> Burks </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, 27, has pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to murder and agreed to testify against <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. Two counts of first-degree murder were dropped. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> testified she felt bad about the murders while they were occurring but went along with <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, sometimes acting as a lookout while <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> smothered the patients with rolled-up washcloths. The two split in July 1987, after living together for nearly a year, and <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> moved to <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> with another nurse's aide. Defense attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Piazza </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> made up the slayings because she was hurt and angry that <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> had left her for another woman. <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Male </PERSON>, a former nurse's aide at Alpine who said she had sexual relationships with both <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> and <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, testified Thursday that <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> admitted suffocating a patient with a pillow while <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> kept watch. When the five patients died between Jan. 18 and April 7, 1987, their deaths were listed as natural and no autopsies were performed. Police began investigating after <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s ex-husband told them she had confessed to him. <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Medical Examiner <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohle </PERSON> testified Thursday he performed autopsies on two patients whose bodies were exhumed in November. He said he changed the cause of death on their death certificates from heart disease to asphyxia due to suffocation, primarily because of police reports. <PERSON> Cohle </PERSON> said he could find no physical evidence of suffocation, nor could he find a physiological reason for their sudden deaths. The alleged victims were <PERSON> Belle </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkhard </PERSON>, 74, <PERSON> Marguerite </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, 60, <PERSON> Myrtle </PERSON> <PERSON> Luce </PERSON>, 95, <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, 79, and <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, 97. If convicted, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> faces a mandatory life sentence. Wood could receive parole in 10 years on the lesser charges.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> fired a ballistic missile with an 800-mile range that landed in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. Officials in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> neither confirmed nor denied the report Thursday. `` We know nothing about this thing,'' an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> data showed the rocket blasted off from the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> area and fell into the sea about 250 miles north of <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. It gave no further details but said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> previously launched a ballistic missile in January 1988. In <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, officials from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> refused comment on reports the missile landed in the sea west of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>. A ballistic missile is a long-range rocket guided by preset mechanisms in the first part of its flight, but which becomes a free-falling object as it approaches its target. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have designed ballistic missiles to carry nuclear warheads. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which launched its first satellite last Sept. 19, has consistently refused to comment on whether it is developing nuclear weapons or missiles.

 <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> had a restful sleep but heavy doses of antibiotics failed to bring down a recurring fever that could complicate her heart problems, a hospital official said today. The 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun, who won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her charity work, suffered a serious setback Thursday just as doctors thought she was progressing well after a heart attack last week. But a statement issued today by <LOCATION> Woodlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nursing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Home </LOCATION>, the hospital where she is being treated, indicated <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>'s condition improved slightly `` The mother is still running a temperature and the cause of the infection is being investigated. There was no chest pain last night. She has taken normal food this morning and now resting peacefully,'' the statement said. A senior physician, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>'s condition could have worsened Thursday because too many doctors want to treat her and too many people want to see her. `` Everyone is so concerned with giving their attendance at the hospital. They are n't really concerned how much each visit sets her back,'' he said. Earlier this week, Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> visited her. The prime minister's security staff was present and a television crew was permitted to film the 10-minute chat. `` What can the hospital management do if the prime minister, the chief minister -LRB- of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> state -RRB-, the health minister and other dignitaries keep coming to visit?'' said the doctor. He said the case had become so high profile, with so many doctors attending <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, that coordination of treatment had become a problem. Doctors said she had sharp chest pains early Thursday and then again in the afternoon. `` <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> has had a setback,'' Dr. K.K. <PERSON> Sinha </PERSON>, a cardiologist and one of her five doctors, said Thursday night. `` There is a heaviness in the chest. This is very serious.'' <PERSON> Sinha </PERSON> described the problem as a `` free infarction,'' which appeared to mean a form of heart attack. An infarction refers to an area of dying or dead tissue resulting from the obstruction of blood vessels. A myocardial infarction, which is death of a section of heart muscle, is a heart attack. `` Very aggressive treatment is needed,'' he said. `` All medication has been given but she is allergic to some medicine.'' Dozens of people of all faiths waited outside the hospital, some kneeling at the gate to offer prayers. Bouquets of flowers sent from well-wishers around the world were delivered to the home. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> suffered a heart attack Sept. 8, three days after she was admitted to the intensive care unit with an irregular heartbeat, a blocked artery and high fever. Doctors said her condition progressively improved after they attached a temporary pacemaker and changed her medication. They had hoped to remove the pacemaker by the end of the week, but her condition deteriorated early Thursday. Born in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> gave up a comfortable life as a convent teacher to live and work among the destitute and dying in <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>'s squalid slums. She founded the <ORGANIZATION> Missionaries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charity </ORGANIZATION> in October 1950 in an abandoned run-down hostel donated by the city. The order, which was formally recognized by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in 1965, expanded and now has 3,000 nuns working in 87 countries.

<HEAD>Showers, Dense Fog in Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Heavy rain that fell over parts of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> was accompanied early today by dense fog, while scattered showers and thunderstorms dampened an area from the central Gulf coast to the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states. Fog also blanketed sections of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. Cloudy skies lingered from the lower <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and the middle <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to the western Gulf coast, but clear skies prevailed across much of the rest of the nation. The upper Great Lakes region, upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and northern Rockies were chilly early today, with temperatures in the 30s and 40s. Hurricane Hugo today moved slowly toward the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, packing 115 mph winds late Thursday, and hurricane forecasters warned islanders to prepare for heavy winds and rain, which should begin within the next 48 hours. Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms extending from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> across the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> valleys to the middle <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, with the most rainfall from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> across the Appalachians to the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>; and widely scattered thunderstorms over <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, fresh from sponsoring talks to end a rebellion in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, is off to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to prepare for elections that could lead to a definitive end to that country's war. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, whose activities in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> this year have given him a more visible role in world affairs than at any time since he left the White House in 1981, will use the visit to prepare for his role as an observer of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Feb. 25 presidential elections. Peace talks that began Sept. 7 between the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> government and the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> may conclude today or adjourn until Tuesday, when <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> returns from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, said center spokeswoman <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>. Acting as a private citizen, though with the blessing of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> has used his public policy facility and think tank as a force to boost talks to end various regional conflicts. In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, as in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> will be representing the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freely </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elected </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heads </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>, a group of current and former democratically elected chiefs of state. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was an observer at the May elections in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Afterwards, his accusations of fraud against de-facto military leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> received widespread attention. Over the past two weeks, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> has served as host and observer for preliminary discussions aimed at setting an agenda for talks to end the 28-year-old war between <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and the Eritrean rebels in the Horn of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` I think I can say without contradiction from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that they do indeed support my trip to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> told reporters in a briefing during the Ethiopian talks. `` But I will emphasize again, this is not a duty designated to me by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration.'' <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s visit this weekend will include meetings with members of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, government officials, opposition leaders and representatives of church and civic groups. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> is expected to run for re-election in election against <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, the director of the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> and candidate of the 14-party opposition coalition. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said his continued involvement in world matters is being conducted by a concerned citizen, not by a man interested in resurrecting a political career. `` You know, I've got a lot of things I could be doing,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> told reporters last week, using the Ethiopia-Eritrea talks as an example. `` And I do n't have any personal thing to gain from spending days or weeks or whatever trying to bring peace to the people of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>. `` But I look upon this as one of the most terrible conflicts in the world, and the fact that both sides are at least going to have good-faith negotiations has already been proven to me ... and I think warrants my investment of time,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Military Probes MX Missile Failure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Military officials are trying to pinpoint the malfunction that forced the destruction of an MX missile making the system's first test as an operational weapon system. The MX missile was destroyed three minutes into flight Thursday, the third failure in a new generation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear missiles since March. `` A team of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> contractor engineers is analyzing data from the flight to analyze the cause of the anomaly,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>. Sgt. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON>. `` After they have complete their tests, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> will determine if any system modifications are necessary to correct or improve the Peacekeeper weapon system.'' The $ 75 million MX was destroyed by a signal sent by Western Test Range safety officers after telemetry indicated a problem aboard the four-stage intercontinental ballistic missile. The launch was under control of a 44-person task force from F.E. <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and overseen by Lt. Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, commander of the 90th Organizational Missile Maintenance Squadron. Fifty MX missiles are deployed at <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION>, located near <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>. Three MX missiles were scheduled to undergo similar tests next year. It was not immediately known how or if Thursday's missile failure might affect that schedule. It was the MX system's first operational test under the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. Nine dummy re-entry vehicle warheads were to be delivered to various targets 4,700 miles to the southwest in the Kwajalein Missile Range. The MX is capable of carrying 10 warheads. Eighteen previous tests of the MX, or so-called Peacekeeper missile, were termed developmental. Thursday's was the first that had to be destroyed. In March, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s newest and most powerful weapon, a $ 23.7 million Trident 2 missile, was destroyed seconds after an undersea launch from a submarine off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast. The missile spun wildly before destruction. The first launch of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s Midgetman missile in May ended in failure when it began tumbling 70 seconds into flight.

 Residents rushed back to basement bomb shelters today when <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> and Christian gunners shelled the city hours after <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> mediators concluded talks aimed at ending the fighting. Police said five people were killed and seven wounded in the exchanges, which occurred residential districts in the city's Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors as well as the wooded mountains southeast of the capital. The latest casualties raised the toll to 900 killed and 2,559 wounded since March 8, when the current round of violence broke out pitting Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mainly Christian troops against Syrian and allied forces. The duel started shortly after the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> ended two days of talks in the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION> late Thursday without issuing a cease-fire call. The three ministers, in a brief statement, said only that they conducted a `` necessary evaluation'' of the situation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and considered the possibility of new moves. The statement said King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> II of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and Algerian President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> will release an official statement Saturday about the outcome of the committee's efforts The Syrian-Christian duel forced the few citizens remaining in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to rush to basements and underground shelters to escape the barrage, shattering hopes that a relative lull in the fighting would continue. The exchanges had sharply diminished Thursday and Wednesday while the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> members met. Local newspapers had predicted a cease-fire in the confrontation between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 soldiers and the 40,000 Syrian troops. `` We were under the impression that this -LRB- shelling -RRB- was over, at least for the time being,'' said <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Makkouk </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem resident of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bourj </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haidar </LOCATION> district. After hearing the talks produced no agreement, <PERSON> Makkouk </PERSON> said at the entrance to his shell-scarred apartment building, `` I was wondering whether we should return to the shelter when the explosion of the first shell echoed. We rushed down.'' The shelling began in March over a blockade by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> of illegal ports run by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s militia allies south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> sought to reimpose government control on the ports. Syrian and allied forces retaliated by shelling and besieging the 310-square-mile Christian enclave, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s power base northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

 A genetically engineered vaccine that protects monkeys against an AIDS-like virus could help in the search for a way to shield humans from AIDS, says a developer of the vaccine. The findings `` offer hope that similar methodologies might lead to an effective vaccine against AIDS in humans,'' <PERSON> Shiu-Lok </PERSON> <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>, leader of the team that tested the vaccine, said Thursday. But he cautioned that the monkey virus differs from the humans AIDS virus and that there were no immediate implications for AIDS patients. The virus, simian acquired immunodeficiency virus type D, or SAIDS D, is an often-fatal, AIDS-like disease in monkeys, <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> said. The research team including scientists of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Oncogen </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> biotechnology company, announced their findings at a news conference at the university's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The results of their year-long study will be reported in this month's Proceedings of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. Four vaccinated macaque monkeys exposed to the SAIDS D virus have remained healthy and free of the virus, while three of four unvaccinated monkeys in the study developed signs of infection within two weeks after exposure to the virus. `` We believe this is the first live, recombinant vaccine that protects primates against a retrovirus that causes AIDS-like diseases,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, supervisory veterinarian at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Primate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and an author of the paper. The fourth unvaccinated animal did not become infected, consistent with reports showing that for undetermined reasons some monkeys are resistant to infection, the scientists said. The genetically constructed vaccine, called `` v-senv5,'' combines part of the protein coat of the SAIDS D virus with the vaccinia virus, which has been used successfully to eradicate smallpox. The four vaccinated monkeys received two immunizations 16 weeks apart. Twelve weeks after the second immunizations, all eight animals in the study, including the four non-vaccinated monkeys, were exposed to the SAIDS D virus. The four vaccinated animals developed antibodies to the specific proteins used in the vaccine, proving that the monkey's immune response was triggered by the vaccine and not by exposure to the SAIDS D virus itself, the researchers said. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researchers working with monkeys reported they had protected monkeys from a similar simian AIDS virus. In that study, the monkeys were given a killed-virus vaccine rather than a live, recombinant vaccine, said <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>, director of vaccine research at <LOCATION> Oncogen </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> said the live virus vaccine `` elicits an immune response more closely akin to that obtained from a natural infection.'' <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> stressed that both approaches were important and could be used in efforts to develop a vaccine against AIDS.

 A 10-year-old boy was arrested and accused of a series of sexual assualts on his playmates who range in age from 4 to 10, police said. The youth was taken into custody Aug. 21 after an interview with Sgt. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaragossa </PERSON>, who said the boy first denied allegations of attacks on two boys and two girls at his <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> apartment complex, authorities said. `` Then, he makes a few slips and leads me to believe he does know what's going on,'' the officer said. `` Finally, he admitted to sodomy.

The child was emotionless while describing the assaults that allegedly occurred in parking stalls and in a laundry room starting in May, and said he learned about sodomy from pornographic magazines, police said. The boy was taken to <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> after his arrest, and later released to a female friend of his mother's on the condition that he see a counselor daily and not associate with his alleged victims, police said. If the youngster is convicted of sexually attacking his friends, he could spend up to eight years in court custody for each criminal count. He could be placed in a group home or treatment facility, or released to his mother with a requirement that he receive more counseling. No court date was set. `` I do n't know if it's that kids do n't know that it's wrong or that it's the type of environment they're in,'' said Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevely </PERSON>, who will prosecute the case. <PERSON> Zaragossa </PERSON> said he was n't particularly shocked by the allegations. `` There are a lot more incidents like these being committed,'' he said. `` Everybody wants to close their eyes and turn their head if they hear about it.'' Of the 27 juveniles with hearings pending in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> for sex-related crimes, this youth is by far the youngest, officials said.

<TEXT>
 Cleanup workers and state officials say there's still plenty of oil fouling the shores of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, but <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> insists the beaches are nearly free of oil as a summer-long effort ends. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials pronounced the 1,100 miles of oil-tainted shoreline `` environmentally stable'' Thursday and proclaimed their 25-week cleanup of the nation's worst oil spill a job well done. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> that the affected shores of the sound and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> farther south `` are certainly what most people would call clean. But <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>, the state's environmental commissioner, was not pleased with what he saw when he toured shorelines on two islands south of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> on Thursday. `` This beach is not environmentally stable,'' he said as he poked a stick into thickly oiled rocks on <LOCATION> Knight </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` If we had wildlife here, they'd be pretty heavily oiled.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials said they expect to declare the summer cleanup complete today, 25 weeks after the tanker Exxon Valdez cracked open on a reef and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil. The company has said a Sept. 15 deadline to wrap up the work was set because the weather gets rough and days get so short this time of year in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. But state officials are pressuring <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to commit to a greater research effort over the winter to determine the best way to resume the cleanup next spring. `` The point is n't that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has done a terrible job,'' <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> said. `` There's just more to be done. We do n't need to wait until spring to get the preparations going.'' `` I think they're looking to get out of it and I think they're trying to put the best face on it that they possibly can,'' <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> said this morning on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> `` Today'' program `` In terms of honesty with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, I think they get a failing grade.'' The company has said that about 300 cleanup workers would remain in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to monitor the spill and respond to major problems. At the height of the effort, about 10,000 people were working on the cleanup. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s Valdez operations, said that while oil remained in some areas, it was n't enough to harm wildlife. `` What you've seen is a coastline almost free of oil,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. `` You're seeing the steady recovery of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>.'' State officials agreed <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts had resulted in some cleaner shorelines, but disputed the company's rosy portrayal of an environmental rebound. On his tour of the Knight Island shoreline, <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> noted there were few signs of wildlife on what once was a shore rich with the sounds of life. <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> said a chemical fertilizer recently sprayed on the rocks showed signs of breaking down the oil in some areas. In other spots, however, it appeared the cleanup was rushed to meet <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s self-imposed deadline, <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> said. On <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> used a pocket knife to scrape sun-baked oil off blackened rocks. `` It looks and feels like tar _ the way an asphalt driveway feels,'' he said. Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> scheduled a news conference in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> today to discuss the state's cleanup plans for the winter. Cleanup workers returned to <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> by the hundreds Thursday on their way home. Many echoed the sentiments of <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Consiel </PERSON>, who was on the first crew of 48 workers dispatched to the oiled beaches after the March 24 grounding of the oil tanker. `` I think we did some good,'' he said. `` But the oil's going to be there for a while, that's for sure. `` I think Exxon should come back next year. There's a lot left to be done.'' <PERSON> Consiel </PERSON>, 39, was an unemployed cannery worker when an <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> contractor hired him for cleanup duty. He returns home to his family with about $ 30,000 in spill wages in his savings account. `` Not bad for 5 -LCB- months' work,'' he said with a smile. `` I'm pretty happy about it It would be nice to come back next year, too.'' Some fishermen who suffered from a restricted salmon season and a poor catch say the sound will never be the same. `` It's time that everyone realizes that no amount of money in the world is going to restore Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> to a pristine condition,'' said <PERSON> Riki </PERSON> <PERSON> Ott </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cordova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishermen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> must pay $ 1 million in fines for illegally discharging phosphorus-contaminated water into the <LOCATION> Seneca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, officials said. The beer maker also admitted its employees reported false sampling data to the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> and hid from <ORGANIZATION> DEC </ORGANIZATION> inspectors hoses that illegally bypassed critical portions of the waste water treatment system. In an agreement disclosed Thursday, the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis-based </LOCATION> brewer agreed to pay a $ 925,000 civil fine for unlawful discharges into the <LOCATION> Seneca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from its plant in <LOCATION> Baldwinsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>. On Wednesday night, the company pleaded guilty in <ORGANIZATION> Lysander </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to three misdemeanor violations of the state's water pollution control regulations and was fined $ 75,000. The company also agreed to publish full-page advertisements in four waste water treatment trade publications advising other corporations to comply with state environmental standards. In addition, the company will undergo an independent audit of its treatment plant operations. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Suhre </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, vice president and general counsel for <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION>, said three employees were responsible for the pollution violations and acted without the consent or knowledge of the company. Two were fired and one was allowed to resign, he said. `` We are a highly regulated industry and we do not accept any excuse not to adhere to the law,'' said <PERSON> Suhre </PERSON>. Criminal charges could be brought against individuals involved in the pollution and cover-up, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said, but he declined to identify those under investigation. The pollution had no permanent environmental impact, but may have contributed to an overall lessening of water quality in the river, said state Environmental Conservation Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorling </PERSON>. Excessive amounts of phosphorus can result in weed and algae growth that can hinder the development of fish and other aquatic life. <PERSON> Suhre </PERSON> said no completely untreated waste was discharged directly into the river. The DEC investigation stemmed from a tip from a fired employee. The state officials charged that <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> treatment plant employees began submitting false monitoring reports on discharges into the <LOCATION> Seneca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in 1982.

 <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, was mobbed by supporters today when he registered to vote in the territory's pre-independence elections. Police, meanwhile, confirmed the identity of an Irishman arrested in connection with the assassination Tuesday night of <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON>, the only ranking white member of the nationalist movement that fought a 23-year war against South African rule of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Police Inspector Kierie du Rand confirmed newspaper reports that <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Acheson </PERSON>, 50, was the man police arrested Wednesday after <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON> was gunned down outside the gate of his home. <PERSON> Acheson </PERSON> is to appear in court Monday, but du Rand said police are still investigating a motive. `` It appeared very professional,'' he said. `` They or he -LRB- the killer or killers -RRB- waited in the bush. <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON> was in the process of opening the gate and he was shot three times in the back. It looked like one bullet was fired from the top after he was on the ground.'' Today was the final day of registration for the November elections. More than 677,000 people have registered in the vast territory of 1.3 million. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, who returned Thursday to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> after almost 30 years in exile, registered to vote at a post office in <LOCATION> Katutura </LOCATION>, the main black neighborhood on the edge of <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, the capital. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said his decision to participate in the elections indicated his organization was generally pleased with the independence process, which is being implemented by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> supervision. `` I'm very happy with the efforts being made by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> in assisting the <LOCATION> Namibian </LOCATION> people, who have been so many years oppressed in attempting to achieve their freedom,'' said <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, whose movement is favored in the polls. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since 1915, agreed to grant the territory independence under a regional peace accord signed in December that also calls for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to withdraw its 50,000 soldiers from Marxist-ruled <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. No date has been set for Namibian independence, but it is expected to be early next year. In brief comments to reporters at the polling station, <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> no longer holds any prisoners at camps in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, although about 200 former detainees released in July say the organization has either killed or has in custody hundreds of Namibians. A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> delegation is in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> investigating the charges but has not reported on its findings. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> delegation `` will see for themselves,'' <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said. `` I leave it up to them.'' <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged torturing its detainees, saying they were suspected of spying for the South African-led security forces. Among those allegedly detained was <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Kowambo </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> and Mrs. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, who registered with her husband today, have declined to comment. The Star newspaper in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and the pro-SWAPO Namibian newspaper in <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> reported that <PERSON> Acheson </PERSON> entered <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> six weeks ago. The Star said he comes from <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> but that his passport was obtained in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON>, a prominent human rights lawyer, was the first white to publicly declare his support for leftist-leaning <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. He was often ridiculed in newspaper articles and cartoons in right-wing newspapers.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s top leaders clashed today over <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s plan to arrange Israeli-Palestinian talks, and officials in the two major parties said the disagreement is threatening the coalition government The leaders of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc reportedly disagreed on the 10-point Egyptian peace plan and on President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s efforts to sponsor a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation for talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Egyptian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassiouny </PERSON> presented <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s peace plan to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders today, said a spokesman for Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had been saying it can not comment on a proposal it has not been officially presented with. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, troops shot and killed two Palestinian youths, including a 12-year-old, in clashes with stone-throwers in the city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials said. An army spokesman said soldiers did not fire in the area where <LOCATION> Tarkek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Said </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tuffah </LOCATION>, 12, was killed. He said a patrol commander shot and killed a second youth when troops were attacked by youths throwing iron bars and cement blocks. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said <PERSON> Tuffah </PERSON> was shot by an army sniper. The reports said the second youth, <PERSON> Ata </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, 18, was killed in a clash with troops that occurred d during <PERSON> Tuffah </PERSON>'s funeral. The two deaths raise to 570 the Palestinian death toll in the 21-month-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. Forty Israelis have also died in the violence, and 114 Arabs have been killed by fellow Palestinians who accused them of collaborating with Israeli authorities. Today's meeting between leading ministers of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and Labor ended in sharp disagreement, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> leaves Saturday for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he is scheduled to meet President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. He said in an interview published today in the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in promoting <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s proposal will be crucial to its success. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc is expected to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> next week and plans to meet with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> opposes a major point in <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s plan, acceptance of the U.S-backed formula of trading occupied land for peace. Along with the peace plan, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> has proposed that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> meet with a 12-member Palestinian delegation that includes two Arabs deported from the occupied territories. The proposal is intended to satisfy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s demand to meet only Palestinians from the territories and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s insistence that Palestinians living abroad be included in any talks. But <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Eliahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Elissar </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s proposal was simply a way to disguise a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives. `` We have closed the door to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, so the Egyptians have decided to push them in through the window,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. A Labor official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the party's meeting Thursday agreed to talks with a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation. The official said Labor would consider leaving the Cabinet if there is no progress in peace talks. The current coalition government was formed in lengthy negotiations that followed November 1988 elections.

<HEAD>Officers Accused Of Leaving Black Youths In White Neighborhood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

 Federal prosecutors are investigating an incident in which two white police officers picked up two black youths at a bus stop, slapped them and then left them in a mostly white area, where they were attacked. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> announced the probe Thursday as a <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said an internal investigation had confirmed the allegation. `` The case ... is a sustained case,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON>, head of the department's Office of Professional Standards, said Thursday. `` In other words, the allegations are true.'' The two police officers, a man and a women who have n't been identified, face disciplinary action as well as possible criminal action, <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> said. The probe into the incident by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> was launched at the request of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said.

Police say that <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Banister </PERSON>, 22, was shot on Sunday when he tried to grab the gun of a black officer who was frisking him. Some of <PERSON> Banister </PERSON>'s friends and relatives say the shooting was unprovoked. In the earlier incident, the aunt of one of the youths said two officers stopped and questioned her nephew and his friend, both 14, on Aug. 15, as they headed home from a baseball game. The officers picked up the boys, slapped them and then dropped them off in the mostly white neighborhood of <LOCATION> Canaryville </LOCATION>, where they were attacked by several whites, she said. One of the youths was hospitalized after the attack and the other fled and escaped serious injury, officials said. Five juveniles and two adults were arrested and charged with aggravated battery and ethnic intimidation in connection with the attack.

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s hard-line leadership today rejected calls for reforms to halt the flow of its citizens to the West, but for the first time said the exodus of skilled workers will hurt the economy.

But <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member in charge of the East German economy, rejected those calls in a commentary today in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION>. `` The reform proposals of those people contain only one point: they want the type of reform that does away with Socialism,'' <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> wrote. `` Thanks a lot for that. It just wo n't be that way!'' <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> also accused <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of causing the exodus with `` promises, enticements and also with psychological pressure.'' He called on those left behind to do everything possible to strengthen the nation of 16.6 million people. Neues Deutschland expressed its `` thanks and joy'' for Thursday's announcement that Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> for the nation's 40th anniversary celebrations on Oct. 7 East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> has vigorously rejected calls for the kind of reforms <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> advocates for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION>. Soviet Politburo member <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s `` loyal friend'' and accused West German politicians and news media of mounting a `` tendentious campaign'' against <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Most of the current wave of East German refugees are young people who have turned their back on the political repression and economic difficulties in their home country. Many are skilled workers leaving behind a huge hole in their nation's work force. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member who heads the state-run labor union in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, acknowledged that the government would have to find solutions to `` bridge this gap.'' `` It certainly wo n't be easy,'' <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> said during a visit to <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>. `` Naturally, it's not unproblematical for us that young skilled workers from the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> are resettling in the Federal Republic of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' According to statistics released Thursday by the West German government, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is suffering its biggest talent drain from the nation's work force since the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall went up in 1961. The ministry report said 55 percent of the refugees who have come to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since August are between 18 and 30 years of age. It said 86 percent had successfully completed high levels of job training. The figures, compiled from information provided by the newcomers during registration after arrival, indicate that 33 percent had been employed in heavy industry and 25 percent in the service sector, where shortages already had been reported. According to the report, most had occupied middle-level positions. The East German leadership has been hampered by <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s protracted recovery from gallbladder surgery last month, leading one <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official to call the country a `` ship without a captain. But <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> told the news conference today that <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was `` on the way to recovery.'' In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Sindermann </PERSON> announced that the Communist government had canceled the opposition Social Democrats' visit that had been scheduled for next week. Sindermann accused the party, which routinely strives for better ties to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, of planning a `` confrontation'' with the Communist government. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> had already bitterly criticized plans for the trip, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> should avoid the appearance of showing support for the Communist government's rigid stance.

 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> decided to let East Germans flee to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> is more committed to Western-style reforms than to an appearance of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc unity, a deputy foreign minister said. <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovacs </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> will not sacrifice `` measures held to be important by us in the light of a possible disagreement by one of our allies.'' His comments were published today by the state-run <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency and the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has lashed out at <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for opening its border to thousands of East Germans fleeing to the West. The border has been open since Sunday, and about 14,000 East Germans have emigrated since then. About 500 more East Germans arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> today after passing through <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> overnight, authorities said. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> today rejected calls for reforms to halt the flow of its citizens to the West. But it also acknowledged for the first time that the exodus of skilled workers will hurt the economy. <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON>, the East German official in charge of the economy, said in the state newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> that West German calls for reform in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` contain only one point: they want the type of reform that does away with Socialism.'' `` Thanks a lot for that. It just wo n't be that way!'' <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member who heads the state-run labor union, said on a visit to <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> that the government would have to find solutions to the problem of losing many young, skilled workers. <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION> also reported today that dozens of Romanians and Czechoslovaks are caught each night trying to slip across <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> Austrian border police in the state of <LOCATION> Burgenland </LOCATION> said an equal number make it across each night. The border police said 40 Romanians and five Czechoslovaks arrived before dawn today. The new escape route has prompted East Germans in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to seek refuge in West German embassies in hopes they also will be able to go West. West German <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said today that 60 East Germans are at the embassy in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and about 190 in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. A West German border police spokesman, <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Papenfuss </PERSON>, said 273 of the new arrivals today registered with camps set up near <LOCATION> Passau </LOCATION> and the rest continued by train to other refugee centers set up in the central part of the country. <PERSON> Papenfuss </PERSON> said in a statement that seven more busloads of East Germans were expected to arrive today. The East Germans are automatically granted citizenship in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and have been given assistance finding housing and jobs. <PERSON> Kovacs </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hugary </PERSON>'s decision to let the refugees go `` is in accordance with international norms and regulations on human rights, thereby proving the consistency of Hungarian politics, the commitment of the country's leadership in accomplishing the reform process.'' Asked if <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> felt a `` triangle'' of East-bloc allies was forming against the reformist state, <PERSON> Kovacs </PERSON> replied: `` It is true that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s relations with these countries have become tense.'' He referred to ties with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> have led the Soviet bloc in carrying out social and political reforms, but <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> have resisted. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has alienated <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> by denouncing the 1968 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion of that country and by pulling out of a controversial <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> dam project. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> is angry with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>'s decision to give refuge to 20,000 Romanians of Hungarian descent who have fled illegally. <PERSON> Kovacs </PERSON> said the strains with the three countries `` are unusual and call for concern,'' but he did not elaborate. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television network said there were rumors <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> would close the border soon, but <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> government spokesman <PERSON> Zsolt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bajnok </PERSON> said he knew of no such plans. Bajnok quoted Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> as saying Thursday that `` no decision has been made'' on stopping the flow of East Germans. <PERSON> Ferenc </PERSON> <PERSON> Somogyi </PERSON>, Hungarian secretary of state for foreign affairs, said in an interview published today, `` We will leave the border open as long as we judge it necessary. `` I assure you that all East Germans in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> will have the opportunity to leave the country,'' the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Figaro </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. The article did not give the date of his comments but did refer to events Wednesday. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> of breaking a 1969 agreement prohibiting unauthorized departures to the West of residents of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries, and it filed a formal protest Tuesday. A Soviet Politburo member said Thursday that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s `` loyal friend'' and President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> plans to visit the troubled communist state next month, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s official news agency reported

 Former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> did not appear today as scheduled before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee investigating scandals at his department, and the panel's chairman said he would seek a subpoena to compel his testimony. `` While he may run, he may not hide,'' chairman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who on Thursday evening abruptly canceled plans to testify on grounds he had not had time to prepare because he had only recently hired an attorney. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., began today's hearing by attacking that argument and <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s tenure at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` I can understand not being able to find affordable housing in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but not an attorney,'' he said. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said he would ask his House Government Operations housing and employment subcommittee to vote next Wednesday on a subpoena that would require <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> to testify at several future hearings. The ranking Republican on the subcommittee also attacked <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s decision `` Not only is ` Silent <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>' silent, apparently today he's also invisible,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> `` Buz'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION> In a statement Thursday night, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said he was willing to testify at an appropriate time and accused thwe subcommittee of unfairly denying his request for an extension. `` I will not voluntarily appear,'' the former <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> secretary said. `` I have fully and completely cooperated with the subcommittee right up until today, but its refusal to allow me an additional two weeks preparation time, when numerous other witnesses have been granted even longer postponements, simply is unfair.'' The panel is investigating allegations that prominent Republicans and former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials won favored treatment from the agency during <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s eight years as secretary and that poor management left <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> unable to account for hundreds of millions of dollars. Opening the hearing today, <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said: `` Mr. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> has chosen _ in a unilateral and arbitrary fashion _ to break a firm agreement I made with him and his attorney to appear voluntarily at this hearing.'' He then referred to a letter from <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> file in which former <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> referred to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> as `` a man of your word.'' `` Regrettably that statement appears to apply only to mod rehab units,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said, referring to <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>'s work as a consultant for developers who sought federal contracts for work under <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s Moderate Rehabilitation program Subcommittee member <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., referred to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics investigation he faces because of a relationship with a male prostitute in criticizing <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> for refusing to appear today <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who requested the ethics review and has made several public statements since word of the relationship surfaced last month, said that when the conduct of public officials is questioned, `` the public is entitled to the promptest possible resolution of those issues before the appropriate public body.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Perito </PERSON>, said in an interview, `` Mr. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> wants to tell his entire story. However, he needs to be adequately prepared to do so.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s announcement was the latest twist in an investigation that already has seen two former top <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> aides at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> assert their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and refuse to testify before the subcommittee. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> appeared voluntarily in May and said he took no direct role in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funding decisions. But his sworn testimony was challenged by a former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official who said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> personally ordered her to fund a $ 15 million <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, project that was opposed by several agency experts. The project was supported by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>, then the city's mayor and a former law partner of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s The developer also hired as a consultant <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitchin </PERSON>, who was southeastern political director of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidential campaigns. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> also has been criticized for lifting restrictions on a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> lender whose portfolio now includes more than $ 538 million in defaults. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> made the decision after being lobbied by former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, now the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's trade representative. The company, <ORGANIZATION> DRG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is the target of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation. Those and other accounts of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s actions at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> had left the subcommittee eager to question him. Several members have stopped just short of accusing <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> of committing perjury in May when he said he was not a `` hands on'' manager. In his statement, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, himself an attorney, said he required legal counsel because it had become apparent to him that the subcommittee had dropped its `` non-adversarial manner.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said he was unable to retain competent counsel until last week and had far too little time to review documents. `` One would think that common courtesy and basic fairness demand that the subcommittee grant to any citizen it called before it sufficient time to consult counsel and prepare testimony,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said, stressing that he is willing to appear voluntarily at a later date. But <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, obviously angered by <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s eleventh-hour announcement, said, `` All further appearances by <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> will take place on a compelled basis under subpoena.''

 A senior administration official, seeking to deflect criticism of its handling of Soviet refugees, said today the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was doing all it can to admit as many as possible but its capabilities are limited. `` We are trying to manage the surge in Soviet emigration in the most humane and orderly way possible,'' said Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>. Testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on immigration, <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said that while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> applauds the recent liberalization of Soviet emigration, `` we must be honest in appraising our national ability to respond to unprecedented, unpredictable and previously unmanaged flows of people.'' Republican Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> was sharply critical of the administration's position. `` No budget deficit, however large, should ever induce the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to abandon or compromise in any way its fundamental values'' of granting haven to `` oppressed peoples,'' he said. Many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have criticized the strategy for dealing with Soviet refugees, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is limiting their entry instead of opening its arms to the unprecedented wave of emigres. `` Just when the Soviet faucets start opening, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government finds itself totally incapable of dealing with the results it has been pressing so many years to achieve,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` We look like laughingstocks to the Soviets and like fools to the emigres.'' In an effort to deflect some of the criticism, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> on Thursday ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to reconsider the applications of 4,000 Soviets whose bid for refugee status were denied by <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> examiners in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> will consider whether the Soviets, who are mostly Jews, would be subjected to persecution if they were forced to return to their homeland, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. This standard will be used in evaluating the applications of some 16,000 Soviets in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> who are also seeking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refugee status, said a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` I am aware of and sensitive to the great chorus of concern which has been expressed for these persons,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said this week it plans to limit the number of Soviet refugees admitted to this country to 50,000 in the coming fiscal year. As many as 150,000 are expected to apply in fiscal 1990. <PERSON> Princeton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON>, Director of Refugee Programs at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, told a joint hearing of two <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panels that once the administration handles the backlog of applicants from this fiscal year _ estimated at more than 50,000 _ there will not be any slots left for new applicants in fiscal 1990. `` The administration should just hang up a sign in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> telling people not to bother applying in 1990,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>. `` Why establish elaborate processing procedures when no one will be admitted anyway? <PERSON> Jewel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafontant </PERSON>, the administration's coordinator for refugee affairs, told panel members that, `` we share your frustration. We do n't have all the answers, but we're working darned hard to find them.'' Two pending bills would require the administration to automatically grant refugee status to all Soviet emigres on the grounds that they face persecution as a group. All Soviets were granted refugee status until summer 1988, when former attorney general <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> ordered that each applicant be required to prove persecution on an individual basis. This change resulted in 20 to 50 percent of applicants being turned down, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Thursday. <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> released an internal <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that said widespread anti-Semitism in the lower ranks of Soviet government and among the general populace has increased greatly under glasnost. State-sponsored anti-Semitism, official policy for hundreds of years, has abated, although many cases are still reported, the report said. The Jewish community expressed its concern with the new administration strategy at separate White House and State Department meetings. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, leaders of five American Jewish groups gave the administration the names of 400 Jewish families who have been denied exit permits. The issue will be discussed later this month in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> when Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> meets with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. Also on the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> agenda is a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request to increase its embassy staff in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to deal with the number of Soviet applicants seeking entry into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The administration's new proposal would provide full federal sponsorship for 40,000 Soviet refugees while private organizations would finance the resettlement for the remaining 10,000. It also would allow as many as 30,000 Soviets to come here under a special parole category if they can find the money for their travel and resettlement. To save money, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced it will close processing centers for Soviet emigres in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, and handle all processing in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with a new facility in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to help with the caseload.

<HEAD>China Toughens Security, Starts Nationwide ID Checks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Security forces throughout <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today began making spot checks of citizens' identification cards in another move by the government to regain a degree of control over the population. Also today, the official press said in front-page editorials that the sacking of a provincial governor accused of corruption shows the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will spare no high official found abusing his powers. A measure similar to the ID card checks was instituted Sept. 1 in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, which is under martial law, in an effort to round up alleged counterrevolutionaries still at large three months after the army crackdown on the pro-democracy movement. No mention was made of the `` counterrevolutionaries'' when authorities announced today that nationwide checks would begin. Instead, the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said, `` The checking is aimed at providing convenience for citizens in their political, economic and other activities, guaranteeing their legal rights and strengthening the administration and protection of the social order.'' Other measures are reported to have been implemented to clear <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> of non-residents before the capital celebrates the 40th anniversary of Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Oct. 1. Authorities appear concerned that students and others who joined the popular movement this spring might stage some kind of protest on National Day. Chinese say notices have gone up in some work units ordering those without papers authorizing them to live permanently in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to leave by today. Only those with written permission from authorities above the provincial level to do business in the capital are allowed to remain. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> newspapers have reported restrictions on travel to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, but government offices in a number of large Chinese cities denied any knowledge of such regulations. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Foreign Affairs office, which handles questions from foreign reporters, also said they were not aware of any travel restrictions. But <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Railroad Station is comparatively empty. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s busiest railroad station usually is teeming with people, with virtually every bit of open space taken up by travelers who have camped out while waiting, sometimes for several days, to buy tickets Chinese say strict security before Oct. 1 is normal, but many also say it has never been this strict. The ID checks have scared away some of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s transient population of about 700,000 _ most of them peasants from the countryside working at construction sites, selling vegetables, working as maids and doing other manual labor that city residents disdain. The new measures are a turnaround from a gradual loosening of restrictions on movement in the past 10 years. In the past, a person needed approval from several different government offices to leave his village. In recent years, however, traveling became much easier, and often the only restriction was cost. The domestic tourism industry boomed, as <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> with money set about seeing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s famous sites. <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION> Governor <PERSON> Liang </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiang </PERSON>'s dismissal, announced Wednesday, `` completely expresses our party and government's determination and courage to punish corruption,'' the Worker's Daily said. <PERSON> Liang </PERSON>, governor since August of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s newest and most open province, was accused of aiding his wife and sons in real estate and auto speculation, illegally letting one of his sons settle in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, and using public funds to buy clothes and hold banquets. He is the highest ranking government official to fall since the beginning of a campaign against corruption sparked in part by the crushed student demonstrations of last spring, which made a major issue of public corruption. The 71-year-old <PERSON> Liang </PERSON> was closely associated with the reformist policies of <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, who was purged from power and accused of supporting student dissent, but <ORGANIZATION> Hainan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shijie </PERSON> was quoted as saying <PERSON> Liang </PERSON>'s fall was not a political matter connected to <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>.

 A Cuban refugee accused of commandeering a jetliner 3 -LCB- months ago was found innocent by reason of insanity today and ordered to undergo additional psychiatric tests. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Comas </PERSON> <PERSON> Banos </PERSON> was scheduled to begin trial Monday on federal air piracy charges for attempting to divert a Miami-bound <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON> based his ruling on reports from two psychiatrists and a neurosurgeon who concluded Comas was `` insane at the time of his acts.'' After his court appearance, Comas, 38, was returned to the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center south of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, where he has been held since arrest by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> shortly after the May 27 incident ended. <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON> ordered additional mental tests for Comas. A Nov. 6 hearing was scheduled to receive reports and testimony on whether Comas should be freed or sent to a mental institution. Comas was in mental facilities in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> before emigrating during the Mariel boatlift of the early 1980s, said assistant federal public defender <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrist </PERSON>, who represented Comas. Three of Comas' sisters, who live in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, also indicated their brother had history of mental illness, said Ms. Barrist. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has long accused <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> of using the Mariel boatlift as an excuse to send prisoners and mental patients to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> along with the thousands of law-abiding Cubans seeking to escape <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s rule. Comas boarded an American flight in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and changed to a Miami-bound plane in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> on the ninth anniversary of his flight from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.

 Security forces have arrested 279 suspects in the latest crackdown on anti-government Sinhalese radicals in central and southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, a government communique said today. At least two radicals were killed during an army operation Thursday in <LOCATION> Matale </LOCATION> district's <LOCATION> Udwelgala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, 65 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the communique said. It said 168 suspects were arrested in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> district and the remaining in several operations since Thursday in the Sinhalese heartland. The statement said 26 `` wanted subversives'' surrendered in central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> during that period. Subversives is the official term for members of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an ultranationalist guerrilla group trying to overthrow the Sinhalese-dominated government The government crackdown was launched after President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> inaugurated an interparty peace conference Wednesday to try to end six years of ethnic strife in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> that has cost 16,000 lives. Although invited, the front did not attend the meeting. The next session will be held Monday. The front has also rejected the government's earlier peace offers. The government says at least 5,000 people have been killed in the 2-year-old Sinhalese movement. The remaining died in a Tamil insurrection that began in 1983 for an independent nation in the northeast. Former President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> tried to end the Tamil secession with an India-mediated peace accord in 1987, but it led to a Sinhalese backlash that was spearheaded by the front. The front's campaign of assassinations and strikes intensified this year after <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> took office in January. The radicals oppose the deployment of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping soldiers in the northeast, invited to supervise the accord, and also say the peace plan gave too many concessions to the Tamil minority. Tamils make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and claim they are discriminated in jobs and education. Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and the military.

 <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibarruri </PERSON>, the Spanish Communist leader who became a legend during the Civil War, was seriously ill in a <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> hospital today, one day after being admitted for treatment of pneumonia, doctors said. Mrs. <PERSON> Ibarruri </PERSON>, 93, checked into <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> y Cajal hospital on Thursday after complaining of serious breathing problems. Doctors today said her condition had improved slightly overnight but remained serious because of her advanced age and chronic blood circulation problems. Mrs. <PERSON> Ibarruri </PERSON>, better known by her pen-name `` La Pasionaria,'' was one of the Spanish <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s founders in 1920 and is currently the party's honorary president. During the 1931-39 Second Republic, she was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and became renowned during the 1936-39 Civil War for her fiery radio broadcasts exhorting Republican forces to defeat Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>'s insurgent army rebels. During the 1937 rebel siege of <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, her defiant phrase _ `` no pasaran'' or `` they shall not pass'' _ became the battle cry of loyalist Republican forces. Mrs. <PERSON> Ibarruri </PERSON> entered politics as a labor organizer and strike leader and wrote newspaper articles signed `` La Pasionaria,'' which is the Spanish transalation for passion flower but can also mean `` The Passionate One.'' She chose the name because her first article appeared in 1916 in a <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> newspaper during Holy Week, or Semana de la Pasion in Spanish. After the war, she spent 38 years in exile in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and received that country's highest civilian award, the Order of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>. She returned to live in the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> capital at the age of 82 as <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> made a peaceful transition to democracy after <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>'s death in 1975. In 1977, in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s first democratic elections since the war, the white-haired grandmother won back her deputy's seat in the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, though she later gave it up because of worsening health.

<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executive who admitted creating a slush fund to bribe officials and make illegal campaign contributions received a 32-month sentence today for his role in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement scandal. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, 58, was also fined $ 40,000 for what the prosecutor called improper conduct that was `` a qualitative, quantitative leap from what has been before this court'' in a string of other defense procurement criminal cases. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, a former consultant to <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> who admitted helping <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> bribe a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official for sensitive bid information on a government contract, received a 27-month sentence and was fined $ 30,000. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, who admitted bribing former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> by purchasing <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s ski resort condominium for an inflated price, was described by Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON> as `` a major figure in this investigation.'' But <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON>, citing <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>'s cooperation with the continuing investigation since his March 10 guilty plea, joined the defense in urging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> to show some degree of leniency. Defense attorney <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Naftalis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>'s cooperation had already led to six guilty pleas and `` will lead to more and more convictions'' of `` individuals and corporations.'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> apparently is providing information to prosecutors about the role of his former superiors at <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which became <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> following a takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> says it is also cooperating with the probe, nicknamed `` Operation Ill Wind. According to court papers in another case, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> obtained approval from a superior to bribe a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> engineer, <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who is awaiting sentencing on his guilty plea for taking $ 400,000 from the company and $ 75,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, for bid information. <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> was `` more culpable than the defendants that have been previously before me to be sentenced.'' But the judge said he `` recognized the extent of the cooperation'' that <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> had given prosecutors. Because of that cooperation, <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> agreed to depart from sentencing guidelines, which called for a prison term ranging between 46 and 57 months. Many of the previous defendants sentenced by <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> in the case had received sentences of about 24 to 25 months. <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> created a slush fund to finance `` a broad spectrum of criminal activity.'' `` It was the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayer that ended up footing the bill for these activities'' because <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> billed the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to replenish the slush fund by filing phony invoices. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>'s concern about preserving government contracts for <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> by paying bribes and making illegal campaign contributions `` can in no way excuse or lessen the severity of what he directed and orchestrated.'' <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON> described <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> as `` the banker for Mr. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>'s operation.'' But <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> `` knew what was going on'' with the money that he placed in various accounts for the slush fund, <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON> said. `` His involvement was as serious or more serious than those previously sentenced by this court,'' <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION>. According to court papers, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> arranged in 1986 to have <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> purchase <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s condominium in <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, at a price that was $ 49,000 above what he sold it for a year later. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, former assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary for research, engineering and systems, has not been charged in the case. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, who also pleaded guilty March 10, admitted transferring $ 400,000 to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> account of a company <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> set up in order to influence decisions on the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contract.

<TEXT>
 Police opened fire on rioting Hindus and Moslems in a western Indian town, and at least 13 people were killed and more than 50 injured, news reports said today. In northern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, meanwhile, police today blamed Sikh extremists for an attack that killed 12 people in renewed violence Thursday night, including eight members of one family. The clashes in the western town of <LOCATION> Kota </LOCATION>, 250 miles southwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, came late Thursday during celebrations to mark the end of a popular Hindu festival, Press Trust of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> said. Moslems hurled stones at marchers carrying idols of a Hindu god, leading to clashes in which `` arms were freely used,'' the reports said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said police first tried to repulse the rioters with batons, but the crowds hurled rocks at policemen, forcing them to open fire. The news agencies did not say if the deaths resulted from police firing or the clashes. More than 25 shops were burned and a shop selling arms was looted, <ORGANIZATION> PTI </ORGANIZATION> said. It is not known if stolen weapons were used in the fighting. A curfew was imposed and troops patrolled the streets today, the reports said. In <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, six militants armed with automatic assault rifles raided the farmhouse in the village of <LOCATION> Rasoolpur </LOCATION>, killing eight family members, said <PERSON> Surjit </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a senior district police official. Elsewhere Thursday night, Sikh militants were reported to have killed four other people. The militants, believed to belong to the radical <ORGANIZATION> Khalistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, escaped, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> Khalistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is one of about a dozen militant groups operating in the troubled northwestern state, where more than 1,280 people have been killed this year. Since 1982, Sikh militants have been demanding a separate state, claiming discrimination by the Hindu majority. <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION> was founded as an branch from <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam in the 16th century. Sikhs comprise less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s population Hindus make up more than 80 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people.

<TEXT>
 Four bombs exploded at banks in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> today as <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> prepared to extradite two cocaine traffickers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to face drug charges, police said. No one was reported injured in the blasts. In the cocaine center of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> 4th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> said it arrested 28 leftist guerrillas and `` bandits'' it accused of working for drug traffickers. The brigade, in a statement made public today, said the suspects belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, one of six guerrilla groups operating in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and that `` together with narco-traffickers they had carried out terrorist acts'' in the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> area in recent weeks. The traffickers have used the attacks to try to persuade the government not to extradite drug lords to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stand trial. <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, a city 150 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> that is the headquarters for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s biggest cocaine cartel, had been the focus of the attacks. No one claimed responsibility for the explosions in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, which damaged all four banks were damaged, said a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> police spokesman on condition of anonymity. But suspicion fell on drug traffickers in the area. The government announced Thursday that it had arrested two members of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and said they were being held in a maximum security prison pending extradition. It also decreed a state of emergency in the cities of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boyaca </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacha </LOCATION> in midwestern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> just east of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. The region is considered a stronghold for drug-linked death squads and processing labs, and the decree allows President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> to put army troops on alert and send military advisers to `` help'' the mayors of the two cities. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION> used special emergency powers to replace the mayors of those cities with military officers, but he suspended the order after widespread criticism that it was unconstitutional. The government identified the men to be extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> <PERSON> Roldan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bueno </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON>. The two were paraded before reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s version of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, on Thursday. <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON>, bearded and wearing a leather jacket, cursed at the journalists and threatened photographers with a cane. He had a cut on his head. A communique from the department said <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON>, arrested Wednesday outside the capital of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, was wanted in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> for `` conspiracy and distribution of cocaine.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said he was convicted of drug-trafficking charges in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> five years ago and faces 15 years in prison. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bueno </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON> was wanted on drug trafficking charges in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and was accused of `` introducing 5,740 kilos -LRB- 12,628 pounds -RRB- of cocaine and money laundering.'' The two are not among the so-called `` Dirty Dozen'' list prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> of the most wanted Colombian drug barons. But the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also has another list, not made public, of 82 lesser Colombian drug figures. It was unknown whether <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bueno </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON> were on that list. Gen. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Maza </PERSON> <PERSON> Marques </PERSON>, who heads <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s anti-drug war and the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, described <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> as `` much bigger'' than <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, the alleged financier for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel who was extradited to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Sept. 6. He has been the only person extradited so far under under a special decree by <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> to bypass the courts and eliminate the possibility of bribes and intimidation by drug lords. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> launched the drug crackdown after the Aug. 18 assassination of leading presidential candidate and anti-drug crusader Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvan </PERSON> on Aug. 18. The army has said it will continue the crackdown `` to the last sacrifice.'' But despite a $ 250,000 reward for top drug barons <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, the two and other cartel leaders remain at large. On Thursday, Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Botero </PERSON> <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON> held a news conference to deny rumors that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops were helping <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in its drug war. <PERSON> Botero </PERSON> said 17 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` technicians'' were training Colombians to use military equipment, including weapons, planes and helicopters, which the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration sent as part of a $ 65 million aid package. Newspapers published an open letter by former presidents <PERSON> Belisario </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Misael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastana </PERSON> <PERSON> Borrero </PERSON> asking Barco for `` clarification'' of reports involving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> rejected an offer by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to send troops to help the anti-drug effort. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has said up to 200 military advisers could be sent to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to help in training and maintenance of the donated military equipment. This has sparked fears and nationalistic fervor. Sen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucena </PERSON> accused the Barco administration Thursday of letting in equipment `` more fitting for an invasion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> than helping root out a Colombian drug mafia.''

Charged in an indictment unsealed Thursday were <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauldin </PERSON>, who was an aide to former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> `` Chic'' <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomblin </PERSON>, a businessman now living in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lachelli </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, lobbyist. The indictment alleges <PERSON> Mauldin </PERSON> was to receive a 10 percent interest in the acquired savings and loans and a financial interest in several <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> business ventures for his role in the scheme. `` The indictments announced today arise against a backdrop of the failing savings and loan institutions and industry in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Eversberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said Thursday. `` The scheme emanated from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> and ultimately wove its way to the halls of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>,'' she said. The 22-count indictment charges each of the three with conspiring to deprive the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government of the honest services of <PERSON> Mauldin </PERSON> and to corrupt the functions of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The three defendants were arrested and appeared in bond hearings Thursday afternoon, Ms. <PERSON> Eversberg </PERSON> said. The indictment states that <PERSON> Mauldin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tomblin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lachelli </PERSON> embarked on a scheme beginning in 1987 aimed at acquiring 10 savings and loans across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mauldin </PERSON> used <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> stationery to write letters to federal agencies in an attempt to assist with the thrift acquisition and business ventures in <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, the indictment alleges. The <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> business plans included an oil refinery, a commercial fishing venture and spices grown in that country, the indictment claims. <PERSON> Lachelli </PERSON> did not return a telephone call Thursday. <PERSON> Mauldin </PERSON> did not answer his phone in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Botsford </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Tomblin </PERSON>, said he would comment after he had received a copy of the indictment. Ms. <PERSON> Eversberg </PERSON> would not comment on whether prosecutors believe <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> knew of the alleged bribery that supposedly involved his office. `` He was not charged in this indictment and he cooperated with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> as soon as they approached him,'' she said. Formerly a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> served one term in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> before losing in the 1988 general election to Democrat <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> now is ambassador to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>.

Although he said that any bidder competing with the pilots and managers is at a `` clear competitive disadvantage,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he was ready to pay $ 300 a share _ without requiring any labor concessions _ if the employee-management bid was not completed. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> opened up $ 2.75 a share at $ 283.25 today on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s directors approved a $ 300-a-share, or $ 6.75 billion, offer from the management-pilot group, which could result in the nation's largest employee-owned company. The plan, which includes a not-strike guarantee by the pilots and other cost-cutting labor concessions, was the latest twist in a 6-week takeover battle. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investor who started the battle and previously bid $ 6.19 billion, or $ 275 a share for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, said his offer today stands `` if the coalition proposal is not consummated on a timely basis.'' `` We believe that this course of action may provide us with a higher probability of success in acquiring <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> than attempting to bid against the coalition that has been arrayed against us,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said in a statement. The pilot-management agreement was announced late Thursday after the employee group made a final presentation to a special committee of the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> board and revealed the financing for its bid. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> would hold a a minority stake in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> under the agreement. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinsky </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes the plan will go forward. `` We bring something to the table that no one else can bring,'' <PERSON> Dubinsky </PERSON> said in a telephone interview early today from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The pilot-management group's proposal includes a seven-year no-strike guarantee by the pilots and cuts in wages and benefits, terms that any outsider would have difficulty matching. Under the agreement announced Thursday, Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> would merge with <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the group formed by pilots and management. Employees would own 75 percent of the company, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> management would hold 10 percent and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> would own 15 percent. `` The merger agreement we have just signed is designed to secure the future of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its 68,000 employees, to serve the public with quality air transportation and to provide the best value to <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders,'' said <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>. The deal still would need the approval of shareholders and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, which is not expected to raise major objections although in the past it has been concerned about foreign carriers buying into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines. With inclusion of financing costs, the deal would total $ 7.2 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> have committed $ 3 billion to finance the buyout and will obtain commitments for an additional $ 4.2 billion, officials said. The buyout attempt is led by <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> and the 6,300 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilots represented by <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>. The group had hoped to win support from <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s other unions. The Association of Flight Attendants, representing about 12,700 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> workers, met with management Tuesday and `` has begun negotiations toward possible participation'' in the employee buyout effort, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>. But the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, representing 25,000 of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s 70,000 employees, has refused to back the proposal, saying it would leave <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> heavily in debt and could threaten the job security of union members. In the past two years more than 300 companies have been purchased by their employees. <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, with 11,000 employees, is the nation's largest company owned by its employees.

<HEAD>Lottery Awards $3 Million to Janitor Who Lost Winning 1985 Ticket</HEAD>

 A janitor who lost his winning ticket for a $ 3 million lottery says he's not mad that it took him four years to claim the prize. `` The lottery was doing their job,'' said newly-made millionaire <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The school janitor from the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Side </ORGANIZATION> picked up a certificate of his winnings from lottery officials Thursday. `` Why should I feel resentment?'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, 60, matched all six winning Lotto numbers in a November 1985 drawing, but accidently threw away his ticket. He proved in court last month that he consistently played the same two sets of numbers in the weekly Lotto game, and the lottery confirmed that one of two winning tickets for the $ 6 million jackpot was purchased at the grocery where <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> routinely plays the game. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lottery </ORGANIZATION> had argued that lottery rules require possession of a ticket to win, and officials appealed the court ruling. But Lottery Director <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said Thursday the agency was withdrawing its appeal after a check of lottery records showed prizes have been awarded previously to claimants who could not produce a winning ticket. None of the prizes was for more than $ 5,000. `` We thought Mr. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> should not have to suffer,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> presented <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> with a mock check, and said he would receive three installments of about $ 450,000 within eight weeks. The remainder will be paid in 17 annual installments, she said. `` I feel great. I have five beautiful daughters and that's where it's going,'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said. `` I have n't thought about myself as of yet.'' Circuit Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sklowdowski </PERSON> ruled Aug. 10 that the lottery must pay <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> the prize despite his inability to produce the winning ticket. `` I have decided that paying this particular claimant is the fairest way to resolve this case,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said. `` We think he deserves the $ 3 million.'' Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said lottery officials would never again pay a claim without a ticket, and would seek legislation to toughen the `` no ticket, no win'' rule. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said he plans to keep his job. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lottery </ORGANIZATION> has $ 14 million in unclaimed prizes, Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said, and `` a lot'' of people make claims without tickets. Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said only one other state, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, had awarded a grand prize without a ticket.

 Federal aviation officials doctored attendance records of air traffic controllers who were fired in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> during the 1981 strike, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel said today in recommending a probe for possible criminal misconduct. Officials produced altered documents when <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> controllers appealed their firings to the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, and then `` attempted to conceal those activities'' during testimony to the board and a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee investigating the case, lawmakers concluded. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on investigations and oversight recommends the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> review the testimony of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials for possible misconduct. `` Our goal was to determine if a federal agency had trampled on the rights of individuals and we are able to conclude that a gross injustice did indeed take place,'' said Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., chairman of the subcommittee during the investigation <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON> suggested today that the improprieties were rooted in poor labor-management relations. `` There was an atmosphere of mutual bitterness, animosity, that bordered on hatred. ... They wanted to crush these people,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said today he could not immediately comment on the report. The subcommittee said it was not judging the merits of the more than 400 firings in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which were among 11,500 ordered nationwide by then-President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> after members of the <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controllers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> went on strike. Rather, the subcommittee report said it was concerned with the actions of <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials while they were defending the firings in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which considers appeals from dismissed federal employees. The first two months of the strike were `` traumatic and confusing times'' at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> center, where 80 percent of the controllers had joined the walkout, the subcommittee report said. Supervisors were forced to handle other jobs, `` and this situation severely affected the condition of the center's attendance records,'' the report said. On Aug. 13, 1981, a month before <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> controllers started receiving final termination notices, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, evaluations officer at the center, began to process personnel files _ in a special area dubbed the `` war room'' _ in anticipation of controller appeals to the federal merit board, the subcommittee said. To justify the firings, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials decided to present attendance records showing the controllers failed to report to work during the strike. The officials told the merit board the attendance records were the same ones used by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>, chief of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> center, when he dismissed the controllers. But the subcommittee said that claim was false. `` These documents, in many cases, either did not exist at the time of the controller dismissals or were riddled with errors,'' the subcommittee said. `` The fact that the records at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> center were seriously flawed was known by both center management and key <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials in the regional office. `` A plan was instituted whereby records were created where none existed and amended where there were errors,'' the subcommittee said. Between Sept. 14 and Oct. 1, the records were sent to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> regional office, where the files were reviewed by the agency's labor specialists before sending them to the merit board But officials at the regional office found many errors, and as a result `` war room'' employees produced a second set of attendance records which were sent to the merit board, the report said. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials assured the merit board that the records were the ones used by <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> _ `` a certification that we now know to be false,'' the subcommittee said. The subcommittee said it was not able to determine who ordered the second set of records. But <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s wife, who worked in the `` war room'' and who was not identified in the report, was the first person to admit to the panel that a second set had been produced, the subcommittee said. At a Sept. 14, 1987, hearing, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> acknowledged to the subcommittee that there was a second shipment of records, but said he could not remember who ordered it, the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s regional manager for labor relations, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shewfelt </PERSON>, acknowledged to the panel the first set of attendance records was faulty but said he did not know who was responsible for creating the extra set. However, the subcommittee said, `` It is very likely that Shewfelt -LRB- and other regional officials -RRB- knew of the problems of consistency and accuracy in the records that led to the second shipment.''

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today launched two monkeys into orbit to enable scientists to study the effects of zero gravity and space radiation on living beings, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. On Thursday, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> used a single rocket to put six Cosmos satellites into orbit. The series, numbered 2038 through 2043, were hurled into space by a Tsiklon booster rocket, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said today. The monkeys' space capsule home, which will be in orbit for the next two weeks, was launched by a Soyuz booster rocket, the official news agency said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the experiment is part of a program organized by scientists from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` After the flight's program is fulfilled, the biological specimens and scientific equipment will be returned to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> for further studies,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. In October 1987, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> carried out space experiments with two monkeys who quickly captured the public imagination with their antics aboard the spacecraft, beamed back to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> by television cameras. One of the monkeys, named <PERSON> Yerosha </PERSON>, broke free and appeared to viewers with a free left front paw and without his nametag on his helmet. The mission was almost aborted when scientists learned he had blocked his food tube. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said of Thursday's launch: `` Apart from scientific instrumentation, the satellites have radio systems for precise measuring of orbital elements and radio systems to transmit data to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on the operation of instruments and scientific equipment.'' Two Soviet cosmonauts, meanwhile, were busy assembling and reactivating research equipment aboard the Mir space station, which had been mothballed for four months before they arrived on Sept. 5, the news agency said. Cosmonauts <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Viktorenko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON> on Wednesday used the propulsion unit of their spaceship to change the orbit of the Mir orbiter, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It said they also had replaced components of the life-support systems and completed preparations for an experiment to produce high-quality semiconductor materials in the gravity-free environment. `` The cosmonauts are feeling fine,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, adding that they would take the weekend off to relax. The 20-ton spacecraft was designed to be permanently manned, and two cosmonauts last year set a record by staying in space for a year. But Mir was unexpectedly unmanned in April because two add-on modules were not ready. The space agency also was under pressure from legislators and citizens who felt its funds could be better spent at home. The four-month vacancy was only the second time that Mir was unmanned since it was launched in February 1986.

 About 15,000 protesters, jogging, chanting and waving banners, marched today through the heart of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> to a police headquarters where many activists have been detained and interrogated. Another anti-government protest, involving nearly 2,000 people, took place at the central square in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, the capital. Some demonstrators climbed onto a statue of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruger </PERSON>, a political patriarch of the Afrikaners who control the government. Both protests were among the largest ever staged in the two cities, and dramatized the impact of President-elect F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s declaration this week that his white-led government would not block peaceful protests On Wednesday, a day after <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s statement, more than 20,000 people marched in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> against police brutality, the largest such demonstration ever authorized by the government. The Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Storey </PERSON>, a Methodist leader, said at a news conference after the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> march that the series of peaceful protests marked a `` turning point in the history of our land.'' In <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, marchers included black youths, dark-suited white professionals, nuns and prominent activists, among them <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, wife of jailed black nationalist <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. Many youths carried posters demanding his release and chanted `` ANC! <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>!'' _ the initials of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. About 10,000 marchers began the protest, but the crowd swelled to about 15,000 as spectators joined the passing parade. Traffic officers cordoned off side streets leading into the parade route but did not interfere as scores of black and white church leaders headed the procession down thoroughfares that normally would have been clogged with lunch-hour traffic. In <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, the only police action reported was against white hecklers. <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> police led away two men shouting abuse at protesters, and <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> officers warned a white man who threw eggs at the parade. The <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> protesters included a white man, <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who said he was a police reservist and carried a sign reading: `` Police Against Police Abuse.'' The march ended a block from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorster </PERSON> <PERSON> Square </PERSON>, the main police station. Policemen looked out from virtually every window of the 12-story building. Six clergymen went to the entrance, and one of them _ the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> _ was allowed inside to present a memorandum protesting police violence. The document also demanded an end to discriminatory and restrictive laws so negotiations could begin on ending apartheid. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, secretary-general of the South African Council of Churches, emerged to tell waiting protesters: `` We have proved our point.'' The crowd prayed and then dispersed. Anglican Bishop <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, one of the speakers at a church service before the march, told protesters packed into <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION>'s Cathedral: `` We are sick of violence, and we refuse to be pushed around by a minority of a minority who support a godless and vile ideology. The organizers had refused to ask official permission for the march, but state radio said <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s chief magistrate had given approval, and a <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> magistrate had given permission for a demonstration in the central Church Square. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> and other organizers repeatedly appealed to participants to remain disciplined and non-violent, even if police took action against them. At one point, he appealed to the crowd not to harass some suspected plainclothes security officers. In <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, hundreds of people gathered to support a picket by lawyers against the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> violence, where anti-apartheid activists say at least 23 people died on election day. Police have confirmed 15 deaths. More than 50 policemen stood around the park, and about a dozen police trucks and armored vehicles were parked nearby. The lawyers also had refused to seek permission for their protest, saying it was `` part of the inalienable democratic right of ... the community at-large to associate and express protest against any inhuman conduct.'' The lawyers in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> and march organizers in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> cited a march in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> on Wednesday by 20,000 people as justification for their actions. Police stayed away from the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> march, and there was no violence, although thousands of people thronged the streets for about four hours in the largest legal anti-government protest held in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> march organizers had refused to seek permission, but Mayor <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> asked for it after acting President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said he would not oppose the protest if it was peaceful and legal. The pro-government <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> newspaper, The Citizen, said today, `` The ` victory' in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> is bound to encourage the radicals to put on even more pressure, raising the specter of renewed unrest.'' The anti-apartheid New Nation, a black newspapr in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, said: `` The march -LRB- in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> -RRB- showed that the state is in retreat. ... Each backward step must mark the advance of our people.'' The <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> newspaper Business Day said of the marches: `` There will be another, and another, each of them raising the stakes until confrontation ensues. Violence, it is safe to say, is almost inevitable, and the television cameras are waiting.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has given Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> the authority to released an additional 2 million metric tons of emergency wheat for use as food aid to distressed areas of the world. The White House announcement Thursday said the wheat could be used to provide `` emergency food assistance to developing countries'' that run short of domestic supplies. Under the Food Security Wheat Reserve Act of 1980, a stockpile of 4 million tons _ about 147 million bushels _ was created for use to supply emergency food relief abroad. The first time the stockpile was tapped was last October when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> authorized release of 1.5 million tons when it became apparent there would not be enough wheat in the marketplace to fill the needs of developing countries. With the authorization to use an additional 2 million tons, the special reserve is virtually depleted. That was one reason <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> gave earlier this week when he announced a liberalization of the government's 1990 wheat program _ to help rebuild <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpiles, including the special reserve.

 A bipartisan group of senators, including the majority leader, unveiled legislation today rivaling President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for improving air quality in smog-choked cities. The bill would, like the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> measure, tighten automobile emissions requirements but does not include two key elements of the president's proposal: a forced switch from today's gasoline to clean-burning motor fuels in severely polluted cities; and permission for automakers to average emissions by engine category to comply with anti-pollution requirements. Instead, the rival measure would require each car to meet the emissions standards, as under current law, and would allow automakers to choose whether to build cars for alternative fuels or reduce pollution in other ways. The legislation, like the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> measure, sets new deadlines ranging from 5 to 20 years for cities to clean up their smog problems. But the placement of cities in the various categories would be different. `` I expect this bill will cut auto emissioins by 50 percent by the year 2000,'' said chief sponsor <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., adding that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan `` wo n't get us across the finish line'' in improving air quality The bill was co-sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and was strongly endorsed by Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. In setting new ozone deadlines _ 101 geographical areas failed to meet the now-expired cleanup timetables _ the new legislation would only give <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> 20 years to clean up its ozone problem. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> legislation would allow three others areas, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, to take 20 years. The Baucus legislation would give those three cities 15 years, but like the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> measure, would force those with the longest extensions to institute the most severe anti-pollution measures. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> measure is before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> environment subcommittee, which will consider amendments next week. <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> is not only co-sponsoring the <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> bill but also is the chief <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sponsor of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> legislation. <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>'s agreement to back the <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> ozone provisions places him at odds with parts of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan, which had backing from only three Democratic senators when it was introduced last month. Asked why he's backing two bills with conflicting provisions, <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> said he agrees with the <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> approach for ozone reduction. The senator said he agreed to sponsor the administration bill _ even though he does n't back some of its provisions _ because it was the `` first effort an administration has made in eight years'' to tackle the nation's air quality problem. Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not propose a comprehensive clean air revision during his two terms in office. It marks the second time in two days that a chief sponsor of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> clean air bill has signaled disagreement with a major portion of the legislation. On Thursday the chief Democratic sponsor in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>., expressed strong reservations with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed cap on future emissions of sulfur dioxide, the chief ingredient of acid The limit would make it difficult for utilities, the main source of acid rain, to grow and take on new customers, <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> argued. <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> said his legislation would tighten tailpipe standards for autos, with the goal of cutting car pollution in half by the year 2000. But it would not force use of clean-burning motor vehicle fuels in severely polluted cities. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration calls its clean fuels program the `` most innovative and far-reaching component'' of its ozone-cutting proposals. The administration would force a portion of the car fleet in the most seriously polluted cities to operate on clean burning fuels such as methanol, ethanol, natural gas, electricity, propane or reformulated gasoline. The president wants a sale schedule for such vehicles, beginning with 500,000 cars sold nationally in the 1995 model year, and going up to one million cars in the model years 1997 through 2004. The <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> proposal would give automakers discretion in deciding how to reduce car pollution, and hand them the option of using clean fuels or other methods. `` I do n't think it's wise to mandate change in the marketplace so that certain users have to use certain kinds of cars,'' <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> said.

 Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left the hospital for his home in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> today, tipping his hat to well-wishers and revealing a shaved spot on his head where <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> physicians performed skull surgery a week ago. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, 78, and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, boarded a privately owned DC-9 jet, which took off shortly after 10 a.m.. About 100 people, many of them travelers at the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> airport, gathered as the <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lourdes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> marching band played while <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said good-bye to <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> officials and to retired <LOCATION> Mayo </LOCATION> physician, Dr. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Beahrs </PERSON> <PERSON> Beahrs </PERSON>, a friend of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s late father, who also was a physician, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was returning home in good health. `` I'm just very happy for him and for her,'' he said. `` Any operation is a serious one, but this was fairly simple and he came through it very well.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, pilot of the DC-9, said the weather from <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> in southeastern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> looked clear for the 3 -LCB- - hour flight He said the plane belonged to a friend of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>', whose name he would not disclose. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> said Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> would go directly to their home in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> after the flight. <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> also said Thursday that doctors were `` completely satisfied'' with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s recovery. The former president had been recuperating at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> since doctors on Sept. 8 drained fluid that had built up on his brain after he was thrown from a horse on July 4. On Thursday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who was in the state to give a speech, and Soviet parliament member <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>. `` It seemed as if he feels pretty good,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said after the 20-minute meeting. `` We've never had a personal meeting before.'' The 58-year-old <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> for a private dinner Wednesday with business leaders. He said he squeezed the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visit into his week-long tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` simply as a sign of respect for him and an opportunity to wish him a rapid recovery.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> brought <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a bouquet of red roses and, according to <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, told him: `` You gave the start to the very perceptible warming of relations between the two countries. Your contribution to this was enormous. You were very wise, courageous and tactful in the way you went about it. I am very grateful to you for this.'' Dumped as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1987 after criticizing some of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was overwhelmingly elected to parliament this year, running as an outsider. He has been urging <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to quicken the pace of reform in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said he had n't requested <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s help in his push for Soviet economic change. `` I thought that would have been a little tactless, since he's in the hospital,'' he said.

 Five astronauts who will dispatch a nuclear-powered probe to <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> in October concluded a practice countdown aboard space shuttle Atlantis today, finishing up a bit late because of minor computer problems. The astronauts and their support crews carried the dress rehearsal for launch day to its finish, even though stormy weather near the Kennedy Space Center would have prevented an actual liftoff. The countdown ended at 11:10 a.m., about 10 minutes later than planned. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said launch crews needed extra time to fix two problems in computers monitoring the shuttle's systems Despite the problems, she said, `` Everything proceeded very smoothly in this dress rehearsal. It was a good test run for everyone on the launch team and also for the astronauts.'' The astronauts were aboard Atlantis for the final two hours of the count. It was the last time they will be inside the space shuttle until launch day. Commander <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told reporters Thursday he and his crewmates looked forward to the exercise `` because it's a real treat to get on board the ship ... the ship is pretty special to us.'' The other crew members are pilot <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCully </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucid </PERSON>, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. The countdown test, which began Thursday, covers the final 24 hours of an actual countdown and provides training for both the astronauts and the launch team. Atlantis' liftoff is scheduled for Oct. 12, but <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> will not set a firm date until the conclusion of a two-day flight readiness review on Oct. 3. During the first day of the five-day flight, the astronauts are to release the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft on the start of a six-year voyage to explore Jupiter. The craft is to orbit the planet and fire a probe into its atmosphere. Anti-nuclear activists have said they will try to block the launch, either through court action or with their bodies, because <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> is powered by two nuclear generators fueled by plutonium-238 dioxide. If the activists can not get a federal court injunction, `` we are going to attempt to enter the launch area and sit on the launch pad to halt the launch,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON>, coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, one of the opposition groups. A recent space agency safety analysis concluded `` the probability of an accident resulting in a release of plutonium ranges from 1-in-2 ,500 to 1-in-2 million and any release from these low probability events would be very small. Similar nuclear generators have provided electrical power for 22 earlier <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spacecraft, including six manned Apollo moon flights and the Voyager 2 spacecraft, which recently sent back pictures of the planet <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. The five astronauts flying the mission say they are confident the nuclear generators are safe. `` I wish everybody had the insight I had and the access to the reports that I've read, because I think if they did they would not have any of the fears they are talking about,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters Thursday. Asked about the possibility of the protesters physically stopping the launch, <PERSON> Lucid </PERSON> said, `` The Kennedy Space Center has real good security folks here, and they're working very hard to protect the vehicle and protect the premises, and I expect that's the way it will be. So I do n't expect any delays because of that.''

 Dozens of rifle-toting police surrounded a courthouse where two Colombians faced cocaine charges after authorities in this city north of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> arrested four heavily armed Venezuelans. Officials said they did not know if the Venezuelans had planned to interfere with Thursday's judicial proceedings in <LOCATION> Fredericton </LOCATION>, the provincial capital 125 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Edmunston </LOCATION>. Sgt. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Flemming </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said he ordered the heavy security because `` we are assessing the situation regarding the situation in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' where officials have launched a crackdown on drug traffickers. `` An ounce of protection is worth a pound of cure,'' he said. The Mounted Police and <LOCATION> Edmundston </LOCATION> authorities arrested the Venezuelans Wednesday and seized weapons from two cars and a van near downtown <LOCATION> Edmundston </LOCATION>, a pulp - and paper-producing town nearly 300 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> on the tip of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Police led the men into a provincial court where they were charged with a variety of weapons offenses. `` Innocent, innocent,'' one of the handcuffed men told reporters. `` No speak English,'' another said. The men were identified as <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Euovio </PERSON> <PERSON> Manzano </PERSON>, <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanabria </PERSON>. Court documents did not state their ages or hometowns. Only two of the men had lawyers. All were remanded in custody until Tuesday when they will reappear for bail hearings. Further charges may yet be filed against them. Authorities said the weapons found in their vehicles included an Uzi submachine gun, Soviet and Israeli assault rifles and more than 3,000 rounds of ammunition. Also seized were six automatic pistols, a .22 - caliber pistol, tear gas, a deactivated Japanese grenade, burglary equipment and an electric zap gun used to knock people In a related incident, a fifth man with Venezuelan identification was arrested at a car rental agency Thursday. Police said they seized two handguns at the scene. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Amours </PERSON> of the Canandian <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the Venezuelans' passports were sent to the Mounted Police forensic lab in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> to check if the documents are valid. He said it was not known how the men entered <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Two of their vehicles had <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> licenses, including one stolen plate, police said. The vehicle carrying most of the weapons had been rented in <LOCATION> Fredericton </LOCATION>. The four were carrrying maps marking a destination in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> that police would not identify. The Colombian suspects, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Galindo-Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza-Jarmillio </PERSON>, both 36, Thursday were ordered held for trial next month. The two were charged with importing drugs in April after police made <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s largest cocaine seizure when they found about 1,100 pounds of the drug inside the nose of an airplane at a makeshift airstrip outside <LOCATION> Fredericton </LOCATION>. The Mounted Police say Colombian drug cartels have been routing more drugs through the Canadian Maritime provinces because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has tightened up its borders in an effort to block drug traffickers. `` As somebody put it to me today, it feels like the long arm of incivility in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is reaching into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>,'' said provincial Premier <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON>. `` I think everyone in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> feels a great sense of unease.''

 Nervous workers met with counselors today as they returned to the printing plant where seven people were killed by a former co-worker who swore he'd get even after being dismissed for mental disability. `` I'm thinking seriously about looking somewhere else for another job. My nerves are shot,'' said pressman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Pate </PERSON>. `` If I go back in there, I'll be waiting for someone else to do the same thing and I ca n't handle that.'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>, armed with several semiautomatic weapons, went from floor to floor shooting people at the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gravure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday morning, killing seven and wounding 13 before taking his own life. One co-worker said <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> had been `` looking for bosses.'' Workers began gathering at the plant this morning, and officials said 15 counselors were on hand to help them discuss and work through their grief. `` I'm looking forward to that. I need that,'' said pressman <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, who was only a few feet from <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> at one point during the shooting. Forklift operator <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he would take a week's vacation `` I'm not ready to come back because of everything that's happened Things like this could happen again,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` I just do n't feel like I can go in there and work. `` There are a lot of workers who have been traumatized by this. It's a shame that management treats people like dogs. They should treat employees like human beings instead of just a number.'' <PERSON> Pate </PERSON> agreed. `` It's push, push, push. They want us to do more work. They want you to work all the overtime you can. If you do n't, they send you home. It's more than people can handle anymore.'' <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>, a 47-year-old pressman, was placed on permanent disability leave last year because of mental illness, police said. `` He carried a big grudge because of that,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswine </PERSON>, a former co-worker. `` He said before he left he would get even. I remember that.'' <PERSON> Oswine </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> had begun collecting guns since his leave. Another former co-worker, pressman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>'s talk centered on guns and Soldier of Fortune magazine White, whose brother <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> was killed in the rampage, said <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> thought of himself as a soldier. `` This guy's been talking about this for a year,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` I guess nobody believed him,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, president of the union local. <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> had become more upset recently because he thought his disability benefits were about to be cut off. Relatives told police that <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> was a manic depressive who had attempted suicide three times. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> also had voluntarily spent time in mental institutions, said Lt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON>, commander of the police homicide division. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> entered the building at 8:30 a.m. EDT and took the elevator to the third floor. `` He just came off the elevator shooting,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, an assistant buyer. `` The elevator doors opened and he started firing.'' Two receptionists apparently were the first to be hit. Both were wounded; one later died. Police found four other victims on the third floor, where the executive offices and bindery are located. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> went from there down to the basement, where five victims were found, then up to the ground floor, where six victims and the gunman were discovered. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> was face down in a pool of blood on the floor of a pressroom. Two other wounded people had been removed by medics before police arrived, and another victim was on the street outside. Former co-worker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tingle </PERSON> said he greeted <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> as he saw him coming around a corner in the basement carrying an AK-47 assault rifle. He quoted <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> as saying, `` I told them I'd be back. Get away from me.'' Tingle obliged and <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> proceeded up the stairs to the first floor. `` He did n't fire at me, I guess because he liked me,'' <PERSON> Tingle </PERSON> said. But `` the guys he had shot in the pressroom were friends too.'' Police Maj. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> said police had not determined how many workers were in the building, but it was `` a bunch. They were stampeding over us as we were trying to get in.'' Sgt. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Portman </PERSON>, one of the first officers on the scene, said he felt helpless. `` Every place we went we were stepping over people and blood,'' <PERSON> Portman </PERSON> said. `` People were wailing, wanting help. And with a shooting victim, there's not much you can do.'' Three of the wounded were in critical condition this morning, including a 45-year-old man whose condition was described as `` very critical,'' said officials at <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital-University </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, where more than 100 doctors were called in to help treat them. Five other people were in serious condition. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>'s weapons included the AK-47, two MAC-11 semiautomatic machine pistols, a .38 - caliber handgun, a 9mm automatic pistol and a bayonet, said Police Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> He carried a duffel bag full of ammunition. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> reportedly had made threats against the company, which prints newspaper inserts and Sunday newspaper supplements, but <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gravure </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> said he did not know of any threats. `` I'm at a loss to speculate on anything,'' <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> said. `` What's going through my mind right now is sympathy and caring for the people who are involved. A woman who answered the telephone at a house where <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>'s mother was staying said the family did not want to comment `` We're just in shock like everybody else. We had to find out over the television. No one called us,'' said the woman, who did not identify herself. `` I guess he was just a sick person. That's all.'' <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> was divorced twice in the past 11 years. He and his first wife had two sons, <PERSON> James </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, 26. `` I'm just tore up inside,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesbacker </PERSON> said Thursday as he left his mother's home in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> and his second wife, <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON>, were also divorced, but they had been living together since 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> said. Police said <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> did n't want <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> to keep any weapons around their home and did n't know that he had any. Police described her as `` shocked'' by the shootings.

 A hurricane watch was posted in the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> today as Hurricane Hugo churned westward with winds of 125 mph and some stregthening predicted, forecasters said. The hurricane watch was posted from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, and a tropical storm watch was issued for the islands of <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>. `` The fringe effects of the storm are already being felt,'' said forecaster <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. `` The seas are already getting rough off the islands because of swells emanating off the storm.'' At noon EDT, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s center was located near 14.4 north latitude and 54.1 west longitude, or about 500 miles east southeast of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Leeward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The storm was moving west at 15 mph, down from a peak of 20 mph Wednesday night. `` The only way it's going to miss those islands is it's going to have to swerve northward,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. He added that forecasters saw no indications <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> would turn that way. `` We've been lucky this year. We've had two or three storms head toward the islands and then turn north. Maybe we'll get lucky again but it does n't look like it in ths case.'' Three of this season's <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricanes _ Dean, <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON> _ turned north into the open <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> before reaching the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, forecaster <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerrish </PERSON> said. Last year, killer Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> held the westward course, pounding <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> developed quickly into a major storm. Its highest sustained winds rose by more than 35 mph Thursday alone and were estimated at 120 mph this morning, inching up to 125 mph at noon. `` It really was amazing how fast the eye formed and it almost doubled its winds,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. Conditions favored the hurricane's strengthening today; forecasters expected no change in its motion <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s winds classify it as a 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, a sort of <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale for storms. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, the strongest hurricane on record, was a 5 _ the scale's highest rank. A reconnaissance plane was to be dispatched to investigate the storm, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> is the eighth named storm of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season. Tropical storms have sustained winds of 39 mph, and reach hurricane status when winds hit 74 mph.

The client died in May. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Klugheit </PERSON> said he read Thursday in The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Inquirer of the indictment of pharmacist <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markind </PERSON> for allegedly trafficking in prescription drugs. <PERSON> Klugheit </PERSON> said that the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had investigated <PERSON> Markind </PERSON> for three years. When <PERSON> Markind </PERSON> died of a heart attack May 18, <PERSON> Klugheit </PERSON> said, he notified the federal authorities but prosecutors never returned his calls. `` I had assumed there was no further interest in the matter,'' <PERSON> Klugheit </PERSON> said Thursday. He said he called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's Office to tell them the man they planned to prosecute was dead. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stout </PERSON>, one of the federal prosecutors handling the case, said that <PERSON> Klugheit </PERSON>'s calls earlier this year had not been relayed to him. `` And we never received anything written about the death,'' <PERSON> Stout </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stout </PERSON> said that even though <PERSON> Klugheit </PERSON> told him by telephone of his client's death, he would need to see a death certificate to formally drop charges.

 Hundreds of workers outside an office building thought it was part of the fire drill when people began gasping for breath, but the smoke turned out to be real and killed one man, newspapers reported Friday. The incident occurred Thursday in <LOCATION> Ipoh </LOCATION>, 120 miles north of <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>. After five years, the Fire Department thought it was time to have a fire drill at the city's eight-story state secretariat building and informed the staff of its plans. To make it realistic, smoke was released into some rooms. The 1,000 government workers began fleeing as part of the drill, but 89 were overcome by smoke, and one of them, a 44-year-old man identified as <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON> <PERSON> Isa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON> <PERSON> Tahir </PERSON>, died as he clung to a ledge on the second floor. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Straits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, The Star and other newspapers reported that the other 88 people were rescued and that 23 of them were hospitalized. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Salleh </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said he was in the bathroom on the second floor when he heard two explosions. `` I rushed out and was choked by smoke. I climbed out of a window and stood on the ledge. Then I heard shouts from below that someone was about to fall. `` I looked up and saw Isa a short distance away on the same ledge. I ran over and grabbed him. I could see that he had turned pale and was gasping for air. After about five minutes, I could n't feel his heartbeat,'' he told the newspapers <PERSON> Kamli </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rani </PERSON>, the Fire Department officer in charge of the drill, said two generators were used to emit smoke and that the smoke was not poisonous. He said the staff was told there would be a drill Thursday but was not told what time it would be. Police said they would investigate the incident.

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> continued to receive huge bonuses while the troubled TV ministry was laying off hundreds of workers, witnesses testified today in his federal fraud and conspiracy trial. `` I had to go to social services and apply for welfare and food stamps,'' said <PERSON> Joanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ames </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> payroll clerk who was laid off in November 1985 along with 285 other <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> employees. Less than a year later, on Nov. 3, 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board approved a $ 500,000 bonus for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. He had also received other bonuses during the year. The Rev. <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who joined the board in November 1985, testified that the largest bonus she remembered approving was $ 150,000 plus taxes. But when asked by prosecutor <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> if she would have approved a $ 500,000 bonus for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said: `` If everybody else agreed with it, I would have.'' She said she trusted <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to keep board members informed of the ministry's financial condition. `` I just trusted him, period,'' she said. Prosecutors contend <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> diverted $ 3.7 million in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> funds to fund his lavish lifestyle. If convicted of all 24 counts against him, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than $ 5 million. On Thursday, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s right-hand man at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> testified that the evangelist gave his TV viewers phony fund-raising figures and knew that $ 265,000 in church funds went to <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> as hush money. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s former executive vice president, told jurors the ministry kept two sets of fund-raising figures _ a secret one with the actual numbers and a phony one with lower numbers that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> read to TV viewers. `` No one understands this plan really but me,'' <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> recalled <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> telling him. Later, <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> personally approved paying <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> to keep her quiet about their 1980 sexual encounter in a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> hotel room. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987 as the encounter was about to be made public. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, 57, was indicted with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, and last month pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud and conspiracy in a plea bargain in exchange for his testimony against <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. He was sentenced to eight years in prison and fined $ 200,000. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, who joined <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in December 1983, said by 1987 almost all <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> revenues came from sale of `` lifetime partnerships,'' supposedly good for lodging each year for life at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s Christian theme park near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, S.C. He said the money was desperately needed to cover operating costs, including a biweekly payroll of nearly $ 1 million. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> considered the partnerships an unlimited `` gold mine,'' according to <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told him: `` This was the easiest money we could raise, and there would be no limit to what amount could be raised in the days to come.'' The trial has included testimony from former partners who said they sent <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> $ 1,000 for lodging but were turned away when they tried to claim their rooms. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was willing to oversell the partnerships because he was convinced he could manipulate the comings and goings of partnership owners `` by getting partners here when we wanted them to come and by keeping them away ... when we do n't want them to come,'' <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, released a week ago from a hospital where he was treated for an undisclosed ailment, also testified he told <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> about calls from Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> threatening a lawsuit over their sexual encounter. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told him: `` ` I have not raped anyone or assaulted anyone, but there is a problem. ... Do what you have to do to get it solved.''' <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> said he paid Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> $ 2,000 from his own pocket and later borrowed $ 10,000 from another <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> employee for Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> in 1984. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> arranged a February 1985 meeting in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> with Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s lawyer and handed over $ 265,000. The money came from <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> contractor, who later billed the ministry for work never completed on <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s Passion Play amphitheater. After the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> meeting, <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> said he saw <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>'s Main Street shopping arcade and told him about the payoff. He testified <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said, `` I do n't want to know and I do n't want to hear about it.

<TEXT>
 The bodies of 18 men were found near the central city of <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION> on Friday, and residents said the victims appeared to be Sinhalese radicals killed by pro-government groups. The government denied knowing the identities of the victims or their killers but said two radicals were killed and 279 people arrested in the continuing crackdown on militant members of the Sinhalese majority. At least 18 partially burned bodies were found in three places near <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION>, said residents speaking on condition of anonymity. In telephone interviews, they said they believed the victims were Sinhalese radicals killed by pro-government vigilante groups. Military officials in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> confirmed the bodies were found but did not say who the dead were or who killed them. Opposition politicians and human rights organizations allege the government has set up death squads to counter the campaign of assassinations by the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an ultranationalist guerrilla group trying to overthrow the government. The government denies the charge. Security forces arrested 279 suspects since Thursday in the latest crackdown on the Sinhalese front in the south and center of the island nation, a government statement said. The regions are dominated by Sinhalese and are areas where the radical groups draw most support. At least two radicals were killed during an army operation Thursday in <LOCATION> Matale </LOCATION> district's <LOCATION> Udwelgala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, 65 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the communique said. It said at least 28 government buildings were burned by the radicals during the last four days. It said 26 `` wanted subversives,'' the government term for radicals, surrendered in central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> during that period. The crackdown was launched after a conference of political parties Wednesday aimed at ending <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s ethnic strife. Although invited, the Sinhalese front did not attend the meeting. The front has also rejected the government's earlier peace offers. The government says at least 5,000 people have been killed in the 2-year-old Sinhalese radical movement. Thousands of others have died in a war by the Tamil minority for an independent Tamil nation. Former President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> tried to end the Tamil war with an accord in 1987, but it sparked the backlash by Sinhalese who claimed it granted too many concessions to the Tamils. The radicals also oppose the deployment of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping soldiers in the northeast, invited to supervise the accord. Tamils make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and claim they are discriminated against in jobs and education. Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and the military.

 <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> may begin to shut down the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant as early as today unless federal agencies decide how it should handle the operation's wastes, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the plant for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday it needs to know what its liability is for the radioactive and hazardous wastes that are being stockpiled at the plant where plutonium triggers for nuclear bombs are produced. `` I know we've expressed that concern to <PERSON> DOE </PERSON>, and have asked that they reach some kind of resolution, by -LRB- today -RRB- if possible,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtt </PERSON>. He said the company has various contingency plans if no resolution is reached, including the beginning of a shutdown procedure. `` That would always be an option, I suppose,'' he said. `` It's something we'll have to wait and see. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said there were no further developments this morning. Officials with the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> were working on the matter in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We're waiting at this point for an answer,'' said <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, acting public information officer at Rocky Flats. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> addressed its concerns to the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the facility, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The company said it is concerned improper handling of wastes can lead to criminal charges against <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> employees and managers. A mix of radioactive and hazardous wastes has built up for which there is no federally approved disposal site available. `` We've got to have someone make some decisions,'' <PERSON> Hurtt </PERSON> said. `` The regulations have been changing and keep changing _ in recent years very rapidly.'' This is not the first time the liability issue has come up, or that a possible closure has been threatened. But the earlier threat in July came from within the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which feared its officials could face criminal charges over environmental violations at the site 16 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The acting DOE area manager at the time, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, threatened to close down the plant unless some immunity was granted for those violations. As a result, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> agreed to come up with a resolution to the situation by today _ the same deadline set by <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> affidavit unsealed in June alleged that workers at the nuclear weapons plant dumped toxic chemicals into creeks that lead to water supplies for four <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> suburbs and illegally burned hazardous wastes at the site. Those allegations are being reviewed before a special grand jury. <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> has said its own investigation produced no evidence of wrongdoing.

 A gunman demanding morphine hijacked a taxi Friday and took two hostages on an eight-hour ride through <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> before he was arrested, police and news reports said. No one was injured. The 34-year-old hijacker, wielding a sawed-off shotgun, commandeered the cab, took the driver hostage and later forced a 27-year-old woman into the taxi, news reports said. The man contacted police on radio, demanding morphine and a syringe, and said he planned to kill himself with an overdose. Newspaper reports said he was distraught over family problems. Police followed the taxi at a discreet distance as it drove through the city streets for eight hours. The ordeal ended when police promised to let the man go free and he released the hostages. He was later arrested in a <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> apartment, they said.

<TEXT>
 `` Sweeney Todd'' is <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON>'s most relentless and uncompromising musical, a brilliant but chilling tale of revenge. That chill permeated the original 1979 production _ from demonic performances by <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Cariou </PERSON> and <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> to <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>'s Brechtian direction to the mammoth, black iron-foundry sets of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franne </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> Now, in an intimate revival which opened Thursday at Broadway's Circle in the Square, director <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> has sought to humanize, if not soften, the story and its leading characters The change makes for a remarkable reworking of what is still the most unnerving musical ever to reach Broadway. This is a much more personal `` Sweeney Todd'' than the original, which seemed, at times, to be more an indictment of the Industrial Revolution for what it had done to British society than the story of real people. Sorrow and even a little pity for <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> and his cohorts creep into the bloodthirsty goings-on at the Circle in the Square. That's something the brutal but effective original production did n't allow <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>'s underrated book, taken from an adaptation by British playwright <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, seems better than it was 10 years ago. A model of compression, it tells of <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, a barber who returns to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> after an unjust exile and imprisonment in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. He finds his wife gone and his daughter the ward of the lascivious Judge <PERSON> Turpin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> plots revenge with the help of Mrs. <PERSON> Lovett </PERSON>, a dotty maker of meat pies. The barber slits the throats of his customers, and their corpses provide fresh ingredients for Mrs. <PERSON> Lovett </PERSON>'s delicacies. Much of what <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> has accomplished has been dictated by the in-the-round playing area. The show began life last spring at the <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, a tiny off-off-Broadway troupe which uses an East Side school gymnasium for its productions. On Broadway, the director and set designer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> surround the audience with scenery. A panorama of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> tenements of the late 19th century covers the theater's walls. So do clotheslines of drying laundry. At one end of the stage sprawls Mrs. <PERSON> Lovett </PERSON>'s pie shop and at the other the home of Judge <PERSON> Turpin </PERSON>. In between, the cobblestone streets of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> become the arena for much of the crowd action. A fog machine works overtime to create the right smoky atmosphere. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunton </PERSON>'s portrayal of the title character echoes the <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Cariou </PERSON> original. His voice may not be as strong as <PERSON> Cariou </PERSON>'s, but his acting has more range. There are more changes in the character of Mrs. <PERSON> Lovett </PERSON>, seen here as a woman willing to do anything for love rather than the grotesque comic figure so wonderfully portrayed by <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON>. <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> is a softer, giddier Mrs. <PERSON> Lovett </PERSON> than her predecessor. She's also a better singer and gives a sweeter emphasis to such comic songs as `` By the Sea'' and `` The Worst Pies in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON>'s monumental score is a study in contrasts. Haunting melodies such as `` Not While I'm Around,'' `` <PERSON> Johanna </PERSON>'' and `` Pretty Woman'' clash with much harsher numbers such as `` The Ballad of <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>,'' `` Epiphany'' and `` City on Fire.'' The supporting cast must grapple with some of the most difficult songs in the show. There are expert portraits and some notable singing by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> as the evil judge and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> as the porcine <PERSON> Beadle </PERSON>. Also turning in fine work are <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> as <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, the young sailor in love with <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Johanna </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Korbich </PERSON> as <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Lovett </PERSON>'s young assistant in the pie shop. <PERSON> Korbich </PERSON> delivers a touching version of `` Not While I'm Around,'' the lullaby <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON> sings to Mrs. <PERSON> Lovett </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabel </PERSON> misses the comedy of <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>'s ill-fated Italian competitor, and <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> as <PERSON> Johanna </PERSON> sings harshly. `` Sweeney Todd'' originally succeeded as a large-scale combination of Grand Guignol and melodrama. It was a horror story that did n't allow the audience to get close to the characters. By reducing the scale, <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> does _ and makes the show more effective and more unsettling. Her villains are much more vulnerable and everyday `` normal.'' At the end of the musical, when the actors turn and point their fingers at the audience, <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> makes the point that there may be a little bit of `` Sweeney Todd'' lurking in all of us. What other critics said: <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Times: `` By forcing us to face Mr. <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON>'s music and the feelings it contains so intensely, Ms. <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> does n't obliterate the Prince production; she creates an alternative. Such is the depth of Mr. <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON>'s achievement that ` Sweeney Todd' can support radically different interpretations.'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Winer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Newsday: `` The show ... is a fast, raging, beautifully bittersweet and deliciously junky Grand Guignol.'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelsen </PERSON>, Daily News: `` ` <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>' is too long at 2 hours and 55 minutes, but its music and performances are worth it.''

 Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has rejected a South Korean proposal to create a single Korean commonwealth as an interim measure to unify the rival Korean states, officials said Friday. The <PERSON> Rodong </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinmun </PERSON>, the newspaper of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, rejected the new <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> plan as perpetuating the division of the peninsula, said officials at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> `` This -LRB- proposal -RRB- is only aimed at legalizing the existence of two states on the peninsula and making them live separately forever,'' the officials quoted the newspaper as saying. South Koran President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo on Monday announced the proposal, which calls for a single commonwealth as an interim measure in merging the nations. To create a commonwealth, both Koreas should adopt a single constitution, under which a free election should be held to form a unified Korean state, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said. While rejecting <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s proposal, the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> newspaper repeated the North's long-standing formula to unify the peninsula under a confederation that would keep the two sides' conflicting political and economic systems intact, the officials said. The paper also demanded that the 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense treaty be withdrawn before creation of a single Korean state, officials said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Early detection and treatment of those infected with the AIDS virus may help avert one of the most serious epidemics of our time, but the cost of doing so may push the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health system into chaos, medical researchers said today. The cost of finding and treating those who carry the virus but are not yet ill could reach $ 5 billion or more a year, with urban areas the hardest hit, researchers reported in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` While the economic challenge of early intervention is substantial for hard-hit regions, it can be managed if the federal government takes on greater financial responsibility,'' said the researchers from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Montefiore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the universities of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Recent advances in the treatment of those infected with the virus but who do not yet have full-fledged cases of AIDS make a compelling case for expanding early treatment, said the researchers, led by <ORGANIZATION> Montefiore </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Arno </PERSON>. Because of new antiviral therapies that slow the disease and drugs that can prevent a common form of pneumonia associated with the disease, early detection may slow the fatal disease's progress, the researchers said. They suggested that policymakers devise a strategy that expands the capabilities of hospital-affiliated out-patient clinics to accommodate better patient monitoring and increased counseling. The authors estimate that the annual cost for a patient with no symptoms would be about $ 854 until drug intervention is needed. Once drugs and increased medical care are needed, a midrange estimate would be about $ 9,600 annually, they said. If treatment were available to half of those infected with the HIV virus today, the cost would be more than $ 4.8 billion, assuming more than 1 million people currently carry the virus but are not yet diagnosed with AIDS. The article also suggested overpricing by drug companies accounts for a large portion of early treatment costs. Drug therapy will account for approximately 80 percent of the cost of early intervention, they said. One company's ability to market a drug without price restraints has led to a quadrupling of its parent company's stock, it said. `` Although drug companies have a legitimate need to recoup their -LRB- research -RRB- investments ... the public expects reasonable prices for life-saving drugs,'' they wrote.

 The Salvadoran government and leftist rebels reached an agreement today calling for monthly talks mediated by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to end their nation's 10-year-old civil war, officials said. A text of the agreement calls for talks every month, probably in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, to work out details of a cease-fire, of legalizing the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas as a political party, and of integrating the fighters back into civilian life. <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leaders will act as mediators during the talks, which will also be monitored by international observers, unless both sides agree that a specific meeting should be private, sources close to the negotiations said. Both of these points were concessions made by President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s U.S.-supported rightist government. `` We worked until one o'clock this morning. Everything went very well. The text will be released today,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Abelardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Torre </PERSON>, a businessman and one of the five members of the Salvadoran government delegation. <PERSON> Torre </PERSON> said both sides were holding a brief meeting this morning to exchange more views and finalize details before issuing the joint statement. Government delegates had been strongly opposed to the rebel demand that church leaders and international observers be present at the talks, arguing the dispute was a Salvadoran affair. The government also wanted the talks to be held every two months, instead of monthly, as the rebels demanded. <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Guadalupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a guerrilla leader and member of the leftist delegation, confirmed that both sides agreed the talks will be held monthly. Asked if it meant the rebel demands had prevailed, she replied: `` I believe so, because they were the correct ones.'' <PERSON> Torre </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> gave separate interviews to The Associated Press. The Roman Catholic auxiliary bishop of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, described the mood at the discussions as `` stupendous.'' Speaking at a news conference Thursday night, he said the main issues of the 10-point document were the cease-fire and bringing the rebels into Salvadoran politicial life. <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said the first meeting probably would be held next month. `` It's clear that the two sides have reached a clear agreement that they should be attempting to reach not just a cease-fire but an end to hostilities,'' <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said. `` I'm very content. I believe this is a very important day for all Salvadorans,'' he said. `` You ca n't solve 10 years of war in 10 days, but putting ourselves on the path to peace is an important achievement.'' The current round of talks began Wednesday and were the first in two years between the guerrilla group and the government. The talks also were the first for the government of President <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, who took office June 1. Fighting continued Thursday in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, despite a unilateral truce declared by the guerrillas. Army spokesmen in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> said four rebels were killed and that two guerrillas and one soldier were wounded. He also said a helicopter was damaged and two buses were torched. Clandestine rebel radio in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> said the army had provoked clashes by moving into guerrilla-held territory in the north and east. The civil war has claimed 70,000 lives.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Friday rejected a petition by <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return home and agreed with President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> that the former president's return would threaten the nation. The judges voted 8-7 against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' return, supporting the government position that it would `` wipe away the gains achieved during the past few years and lead to total economic collapse.'' `` We can not argue with that determination,'' the court wrote in a 30-page opinion. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had appealed Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s decision not allow him, his wife <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> and other family members to return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has lived in exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since 1986 following a popular uprising that brought Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has the votes to reverse a 1973 case that legalized abortions, according to Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, who wrote the landmark <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision. `` The votes are there to overturn it,'' <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> told students at <ORGANIZATION> Buena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in response to a question Thursday night. `` What will happen, I do n't know. It may be overruled.'' In the 1973 case, the court said government could not interfere in the rights of a woman to an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy. It said states could regulate abortions during the second trimester only to protect a woman's health, and may take steps to protect the life of the fetus in the third trimester of pregnancy. In a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case decided by the court July 3, the court gave states broader powers to regulate abortions, but <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said he was `` surprised'' the high court did not overturn <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. Three other abortion-related cases are due to be decided by the court in the coming term, which begins next month. <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> dissented from the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> decision and denounced it from the bench, saying the court had silently invited further challenges that would lead to overturning his 1973 ruling. He told students at the northwestern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> school he did n't want to comment further because of the three additional cases on abortion pending before the court. `` I do n't know what will happen, but it -LRB- <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> -RRB- may be overturned,'' he said. <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, appointed to the court by President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in 1970, did not discuss abortion during his wide-ranging talk on constitutional freedoms. His remarks on the topic came in response to a question.

 Rocket and artillery duels flared across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Friday after a two-day lull, killing seven people and raising doubts that <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> efforts to end the bloodshed would succeed. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s shrunken population returned to underground shelters overnight as the Syrian-Christian battles picked up. After a brief morning break, the exchanges flared again in the afternoon, sending scores of artillery rounds and rockets crashing into Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the Moslem sector in the west. Police said seven people were killed and 21 wounded, bringing the overall toll to 902 killed and 2,613 wounded since the fighting began March 8. The foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> ended a two-day meeting in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> on Thursday and said they would present to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders plans for ending the violence. Details of the plans were expected to be released in a communique Saturday. The meetings were the first held by the mediation committee since July 31, when the panel appointed accused <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> of blocking peace efforts by refusing to withdraw its soldiers from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The committee was appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in May to find a solution to the crisis. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They were deployed in 1976 under an Arab League mandate to quell the country's civil war but have joined with Moslem militias to fight the mainly Christian troops of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has declared a `` war of liberation'' to drive out the Syrians. The latest confrontation began in March after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded militia-run ports. The Syrians responded by shelling the 310-square-mile Christian heartland north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Syrian gunners, alternating between 130mm mortars and multi-barraled rocket launchers, hammered east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the surrounding Christian hinterland Friday. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners blasted west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and hills to the southeast with U.S.-made 155mm howitzers and mortars of various caliber. Radio stations interrupted programming to list the districts targeted by the random barrages and urged residents to take precautions. Only 10 percent of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s 1.5 million people remain in the city. The others have fled to safer areas of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> or left the country altogether. Residents appeared skeptical the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> committee would succeed in ending their agony. `` I do n't think the committee will be able to solve our problem,'' said <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasbini </PERSON>, a bank employee, in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` But I can not stop hoping that someone, somehow will come up with a solution, at least a truce that would put an end to the present round of criminal madness.'' <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Makkouk </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem salesman, said of the new shelling: `` We were under the impression that this is over, at least for the time being.'' `` We thought of taking a break from living in the underground shelter. We started our evening in the apartment. `` We were watching television which interrupted programming to report that the Arab committee has concluded its meeting, but no cease-fire accord was reached. `` I was thinking whether we should return to the shelter when the explosion of the first shell echoed. We rushed down,'' he said. `` Now they say a cease-fire will be announced Saturday. I ca n't believe it anymore I think we'll spend the winter as well in the shelter.''

 Law enforcement officials ended a strategy session for combatting drugs Friday with a pledge to work together to defeat major traffickers and criminal syndicates like <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel The delegates also sent a letter to Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> pledging support for his `` courageous fight'' against the syndicates. `` These criminal groups not only challenge the rule of law and jeopardize the judicial structures of Colombian society, but they challenge the nations of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> regions and the whole international community as well,'' the message said. `` In this context, we recognize that your struggle is our struggle. The success of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> ... is of vital importance to us all,'' the law enforcement officials said. Delegates from more than 100 countries attended the U.N.-sponsored meeting. <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> said drug offenses are taking up 40 percent of the time and resources of the 147-nation police network. <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> pointed to a new telecommunications systems linking 28 <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> states in an information network as the kind of joint project that can enhance surveillance and interception of drug dealers. The network goes into operation next month. Delegates to the five-day conference called for harsher sentences for convicted drug traffickers, including the death penalty, and some argued for more severe treatment of drug users as well. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Saphos </PERSON>, chief of the narcotics and dangerous drugs section of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, called for measures to `` pierce all forms of bank secrecy'' so that governments can seize illegal drug profits hidden in foreign banks. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> was to be represented at the meeting by a delegation led by <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, director-general of the national police force, but conference sources said the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> officials failed to show up.

 Rock impresario <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fey </PERSON> has never been to a symphony concert and says he prefers the Beatles over <PERSON> Bach </PERSON> but he's still confident he can save the Denver Symphony Orchestra `` Hey, you do n't have to know it to sell it,'' said <PERSON> Fey </PERSON> on Thursday. Rescuing the financially beleaguered <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> should be `` a walk through the park'' compared to dealing with the super-egos and super-salaries of such acts as the <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stones </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, he said. `` These guys are treated bigger than God,'' he said of the greats he has brought to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> since launching his career in 1967 by presenting The Doors. <PERSON> Fey </PERSON> said he would leave it to the members of the provisionally renamed <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> to choose conductors and music for a proposed 26-week season starting about Nov. 1, he said. `` If I had my druthers, I'd have the Beatles, the Stones, the Who and Led <ORGANIZATION> Zeppelin </ORGANIZATION> done by the symphony,'' said <PERSON> Fey </PERSON>. `` I'm not a dictator. I'm a messenger. I do n't tell them what they should like. I ask what they want and I get it. ... If it sells, it's good.'' <PERSON> Fey </PERSON> spoke enthusiastically about <PERSON> Grofe </PERSON>'s `` Grand Canyon Suite,'' and <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>'s Piano Concerto No. 1, while acknowledging that at the age of 50 he has yet to attend a formal symphony concert. Patrons can wear whatever they wish at his symphony concerts, said <PERSON> Fey </PERSON>, clad in a <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> sweatshirt, white shorts, and tennis shoes without socks. `` It's not what you wear, it's what you hear.'' <PERSON> Fey </PERSON> filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1986 with debts of nearly $ 5 million, then bounced back with a new partner and a streamlined <ORGANIZATION> Fey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Now he plans to spend $ 8,000 a week to promote the symphony He expresses confidence that he can pull of the gamble. `` I only need 600 people per concert to cover my expenses,'' he said. Part of his low-overhead plan to save the orchesatra would pay each musician about $ 22,000 a year _ twice the figure offered by the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The musicians voted earlier this week to hire <PERSON> Fey </PERSON> after they were offered another proposal that would give them a much lower salary.

 Actress <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> came to court today in a <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> and a furious mood, calling the policeman who arrested her during a traffic stop and everyone else involved in the case a `` liar.'' `` I like men of achievement, not a man with a gun. ... I should have scratched his eyes out,'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> _ who is under court order not to talk about the case _ told reporters outside the courtroom where she is on trial on charges of slapping Officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>. `` I think that cop is not too bright. I think he must be very spoiled because he's very sexy. He's gorgeous. He's sexy, but I do n't like that man,'' said the former beauty queen. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> is charged with misdemeanor battery on a police officer, disobeying an officer's orders, driving with an expired license, and having an open container of alcohol in her car and an expired car registration. A conviction carries a maximum two years in jail and $ 4,000 fine. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> pulled her over on June 14 for having expired registration licenses on her $ 215,000 Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible. As he checked for violations, Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> allegedly drove off, was stopped again and slapped <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>'s face. The outburst came before a second day of testimony. Questioned by Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Elden </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> and defense attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Graysen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> had testified Thursday that Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> cursed, spit on him and slapped him. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s diatribe began at the curb outside the courthouse, where she alighted from the Rolls in a trouser outfit of black pants, black-and-white polka dot top with a red silk corsage on the left shoulder. `` This man is the biggest liar and the Police Department is the biggest liar in the world,'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> charged, ignoring pleas from her attorney reminding her about the gag order in the case. `` The officer's a liar and the district attorney's a liar. Every word of it is a lie. I was there,'' she said. `` He's a vulgar policeman and he's a liar,'' the actress said. <PERSON> Graysen </PERSON> said prior to Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s arrival that she was `` a strong woman'' and `` she's holding up well.'' Thursday's testimony featured a recreation of the traffic stop that ended in a minor altercation and Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s arrest. `` Officer, you promise not to strike my client?'' the defense attorney asked in jest at one point. Recounting the incident, <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> screamed at him, `` Do you know who I am?'' `` She closed the door and she spun around and slapped me on the side of the face. I was very surprised,'' <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, under cross-examination, was asked to stand alongside <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, as he wore his helmet and sunglasses. `` I'm afraid of him,'' said the 5-foot-3 actress as she stood next to the 6-foot-4 officer within inches of the jury box on Thursday. Smiling, she demonstrated a strike to <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>'s left cheek, showing it was a considerable reach. `` I did n't realize he was so tall. He is very gorgeous,'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> said during a break in testimony. Jurors also heard a recorded police radio transmission of Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s traffic stop and <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>'s inquiry for a computer check on a date of birth for the actress. The answer came back as June 6, 1923. An enlarged copy of Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s drivers license was displayed to jurors and it showed the birthdate had been altered. Asked why he did n't issue a misdemeanor citation for an altered license, <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said, `` It was an amateur job of alteration.'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said witnesses will prove the officer's actions were professional throughout the 15-minute episode. When she arrived in court Thursday, Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> deflected questions about her age, which ranges from 62 to 70, depending on the source. `` The only good thing that comes out of this is my face cream sells like hot cakes,'' the former Miss <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and cosmetics entrepreneur concluded. <PERSON> Graysen </PERSON> said in his statement that <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> overreacted and Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> acted in self-defense. Witnesses will show there is a pattern of excessive force by <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> and a coverup of that behavior by the Police Department, he said. `` He's a bad cop,'' <PERSON> Graysen </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today lamented the `` horrible'' loss of life when a man with an assault rifle went on a rampage in a <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, printing plant but said he still opposes legislation to ban such weapons. `` If you have somebody who is deranged, and I do n't want to prejudice this poor soul, but if he was deranged, I'm afraid you're going to have incidents like this,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said In a luncheon interview with out-of-town reporters, the president was asked what he would say to the families of the victims of Thursday's rampage by a man who used a AK-47 assault rifle and other weapons to shoot 20 of his former co-workers, killing seven of them and himself. `` I would tell them, I feel horrible about the loss of life ... I would tell them we must do everything we can to enforce laws that are already on the books,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied. The president has banned the import of foreign-made assault rifles into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including the Chinese-made AK-47. However, possession of the weapon is not a federal offense and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has taken no steps toward proposing curbs on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacture of such weapons. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> answered a wide range of questions with a group of reporters after a luncheon in the State Dining Room. On his anti-drug plan, he said he was ready to bargain with the Democratic-led <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to come up with a compromise for paying for the program. And while the president said he still prefers his administration's formula for funding his $ 7.9 billion program, `` we're flexible.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also acknowledged that overlapping responsibilities and missions of various law and drug enforcement agencies were sometimes getting in the way of effective enforcement. He said that his drug policy director, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, is working on better coordination `` to try to cope with the bureaucratic competition that exists. I ca n't tell you we've got it whipped; I can tell you we've made progress.'' The president reiterated his decision not to press for a tax increase to help pay for his war on drugs. `` A tax increase would be counterproductive,'' he said. On next week's education summit with governors in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` we're going to have some roll-up-your-sleeves meetings.'' He said that, overall, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> educational performance was disappointing, measured against achievement of students in other industrialized nations. `` We're getting less in terms of our investment,'' he said. On the subject of guns, the president, a longtime opponent of gun-control legislation, noted that many local government do have measures banning automatic and semi-automatic weapons. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday's shootings in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> reminded him, as a Texan, of a 1966 incident in which a sniper who occupied a tower on the campus of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> shot 44 people, killing 16. `` It is terrible and the loss of human life is horrible. But I have seen no evidence that a law banning a specific weapon is going to guard against it ...,'' he said. `` So, my view is: do everything you can in terms of education, do everything you can in terms of enforcing your laws that are on the books.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recalled that years ago, he went to register his own hunting guns to comply with a <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> law requiring registration of all firearms. He said he asked the clerk if `` criminals'' had complied with the law and was told, in return, that no, just `` a bunch of suckers like you ...'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he was strongly opposed to the legalization of drugs and that it would never be given consideration at the federal level as long as he was president. Returning to the issue of new taxes for fighting crime and drugs, the president said that, while he would n't advocate new federal taxes for building new prisons, he could understand if state and local governments raised taxes. `` Yes, the states and localities are having to step up themselves and do stuff ... That's up to them. I'm not going to criticize a governor or a municipality that has to do something on the revenue side,'' he said. `` I'm going to try to hold the line as president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on federal taxes.'' In the only question on international affairs, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should consider diverting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds from the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to help finance the war on drugs. He said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could not afford to back off its military ommitment to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, saying it needs to prudently deal with the threat from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` I think I'm doing what's in the national interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he added.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> chairman urged the nation's broadcasters Friday to tune out `` shock radio,'' programs that use sexually and racially oriented humor to attract audiences. `` We are not simply recorders, transmitters and antennas,'' <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON> told those attending the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> radio convention. `` We are what we broadcast.'' <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON>, a former owner of several radio stations, said the association should revive its programming code, dropped in the early 1980s as the result of a federal anti-trust lawsuit against provisions regarding commercials. Such standards should be drawn up by the industry, without government pressure, said <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON>, who took over the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> chair in August. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 24 said it was taking enforcement action against three stations _ WLUP-AM in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> KSJO-FM </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WFBQ-FM </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> _ `` which may have broadcast indecent programs in violation of the law.'' The stations were given 30 days to respond to <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> inquiries, which the agency said were based on a review of public complaints. According to <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> transcripts, the material involved sexually oriented humor broadcast during daytime hours. `` I know that people say the commissioners were simply responding to congressional pressures,'' <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON> said. `` But, in that regard, let me say this: You really ought to first read the program material which we cited, and also note that it was being broadcast at a time when children almost certainly were listening.'' NAB President <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> said the organization could not consider a new code unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approves pending legislation granting the broadcast industry an anti-trust exemption for programming content codes.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Drops to Lowest Level in Nearly Five Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit narrowed to $ 7.58 billion in July, its lowest level in nearly five years, the government said Friday, but some analysts fear the improvement will be temporary if the dollar continues to rise against other currencies. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the July deficit dropped 5.3 percent from a revised June imbalance of $ 8.01 billion. The July gap was the slimmest since a $ 6.79 billion imbalance in December 1984. Analysts pointed to the export category in the report, particularly capital goods, as the main reason for the deficit improvement. While exports dropped 1.8 percent, they still totaled a strong $ 30.74 billion, the fifth straight month that exports have remained above $ 30 billion. Capital goods exports rose $ 300 million while capital goods imports fell $ 530 million. `` That is exactly the type of thing we need to see,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, vice president for international economics at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do n't have a prayer of solving our trade problems if we do n't have a big turnaround in our capital goods balance.'' Overall, imports fell 2.5 percent to $ 38.32 billion, their lowest level since February, due in part to an unexpectedly small rise in oil imports. The trade deficit is the difference between imports and exports. Many economists had been looking for a deficit of $ 8.5 billion to $ 9 billion because of increasing oil imports and the rising value of the dollar, which cuts into exports by making them more expensive overseas. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the export volume reflects booming economies overseas but cautioned that `` the going will get tougher as we move to the end of the year and into the next.'' The reason is, he said, is that `` by late in the year, the higher dollar will be denting exports'' and `` the booming economies overseas will probably slow down.'' But <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm, questioned the impact of the higher dollar. `` It used to be that when the dollar rose, domestic manufacturers threw in the towel, saying they could n't compete at those prices,'' he said. `` Now a lot of our clients are deciding to stick it out. They realize their profit margins will be temporarily slashed, but they're determined to retain their foothold in the foreign market and ride this thing out.'' Oil imports rose 2.9 percent to $ 4.32 billion in July. The amount rose to 8.14 million barrels a day from 7.93 million in June, but the price per barrel fell to $ 17.12 from $ 17.67 in June. Analysts say oil imports will continue to rise as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption increases and domestic production falls, becoming a major factor in producing a widening deficit in coming months. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an industry group, reported imported oil in July accounted for more than half of monthly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> petroleum needs, the first time that has occurred in 12 years. The decrease in the July deficit represented the first back-to-back declines since mid-1988, when the imbalances dropped in March, April and May. Undersecretary of Commerce <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> said the deficit has dropped 10.3 percent in the first seven months of the year, including a 15.1 percent increase in exports and an 8.4 percent increase in imports compared to the same period of 1988. For the first seven months of 1989, the trade deficit was running at an annual rate of $ 105.8 billion, down 10.7 percent from last year's total deficit of $ 118.5 billion. The largest deficit in July continued to be with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an imbalance of $ 4.04 billion, up from a June deficit of $ 3.94 billion. Next was <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, which totaled $ 1.26 billion in June, while the deficit with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was $ 510 million.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he's ready to deal with Democrats on how to pay for the war on drugs, declaring `` we're flexible in terms of the funding method. However, the president repeated his objections to any proposal that includes either a tax increase or deep military spending cuts. `` We ca n't afford to sacrifice our military preparedness,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a question-and-answer session with a group of out-of-town reporters he invited to a White House lunch. The administration has previously voiced opposition to a proposal by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> that it claims would make unacceptably sharp cuts in defense spending. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated he still prefers his own formula for raising the $ 717 million in additional spending above the $ 7.1 billion he had previously proposed for anti-drug spending in the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. However, as negotiations were set to begin with congressional Democrats on a compromise, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` We're flexible in terms of the funding method, but I strongly believe that we must retain the integrated elements of this drug strategy which took more than six months to develop.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also repeated his opposition to new taxes to pay for the war on crime and drugs, although he acknowledged that states and some local governments might need to raise taxes to help pay for new prisons. `` That's up to them. I'm not going to criticize a governor or a municipality that has to do something on the revenue side,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Earlier today, civil rights leader <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s drug plan inadequate `` I submit that we can not expect Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and -LRB- drug policy chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> to come up with a plan to deal with drugs in our community,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel. `` The drug war does not begin at the White House. It begins at our house.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> conceded the administration will not likely get the budget offsets in the categories <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested to fund the drug war. `` That does n't seem to be the game in town right now,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told the reporters at the White House. He said it was likely what `` we're going to talk about is some kind of across-the-board reductions. Rather than taking money out of this box and putting it in this box, you may see some small fraction of a percentage reduction'' throughout the budget. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> shook hands warmly before addressing the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, but in his remarks <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was critical of both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. `` In April, Mr. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> announced that he would take comprehensive emergency action to attack the drug crisis in the nation's capital,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in comments marked by repeated applause from spectators as well as a few shouts of approval. `` Five months later, we still have the emergency but no action.'' `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced a drug plan for <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Where is his plan for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and cities across the nation?'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has been mentioned as possible mayoral candidate in the capital. He said more money than the $ 7.9 billion envisioned by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was needed to do the job as well as input from community leaders who have first-hand experience with fighting the drug problem. Meantime, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiations on financing the war on drugs got under way, with Democrats demanding a boost in funding and Republicans saying more money was less important than quick action on the plan. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, many lawmakers appeared cool to a proposal from Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to gain an additional $ 2.2 billion for the $ 7.9 billion drug war through a half-percent cut in federal programs across the Elsewhere Thursday, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> got into a sharply worded exchange with Democrats on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> while lobbying for the administration plan. The task force includes nine Democrats and nine Republicans, and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> would be in on the talks. `` This thing could take a couple of weeks,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. He said Republicans might freeze <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action on a dozen money bills only two weeks from the start of fiscal 1990 unless the negotiations produced results. Majority Democrats control the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> could use the rules to block the money bills. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s proposed across-the-board cut remains attached to a money bill for transportation programs that is awaiting final action in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Republicans oppose the measure, which would delete $ 1.8 billion from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s budget.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executive described as a major figure in a defense procurement scandal was sentenced to 32 months in prison Friday for bribing <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for inside information on contract bids. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, 59, who admitted bribing former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> by buying a resort condominium at an inflated price, was fined $ 40,000 after also pleading guilty to charges that he set up a slush fund to pay bribes and make illegal campaign contributions.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s smog-reduction plan got some competition Friday as a bipartisan group of senators unveiled a rival bill to cut auto pollution and set new deadlines for cities to clean their air. The rival measure, strongly backed by Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, significantly alters he <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> approach to automobile pollution but takes a similar approach to setting clean-up timetables for smog-choked cities. Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., the bill's chief sponsor, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan `` wo n't get us across the finish line'' in improving air quality, and predicted the rival proposal would `` cut auto emissions by 50 percent by the year 2000. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, the chief sponsor of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> legislation in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, also is co-sponsoring the <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> anti-smog measure.

But he sponsored the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> legislation, <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> said, because he agrees with many of its provisions, and wanted to support the `` first effort an administration has made in eight years'' to tackle the nation's air quality problem. Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not propose a comprehensive revision to the 1977 clean-air law during his eight years in office. The proposal introduced Friday covers only urban smog proposals, but any clean-air legislation will also include provisions on airborne toxic chemicals and acid rain. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal, which covers all three areas, is now under consideration by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> environment subcommittee. Smog is air pollution generated by motor vehicles, industry, and other sources in urban areas. A major component is ozone, which at ground level is produced by the combination of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides _ both given off by tailpipes _ in the presence of sunlight and heat. Since 90 percent of the ozone breathed into the lungs is never exhaled, with ozone molecules reacting with sensitive lung tissue to cause a number of health consequences. These include chest pains, shortness of breath, coughing, nausea, throat irritatiion and increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. The automobile section of the <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> bill would, like the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> measure, would tighten current tailpipe anti-pollution requirements but would not include two key elements of the president's proposal _ a forced switch from today's gasoline to clean-burning motor fuels in severely polluted cities and permission for automakers to average emissions by engine category to comply with anti-pollution requirements. Instead, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure would require each model to meet the emissions standards, as under current law, and would allow automakers to choose whether to build cars using alternative fuels or reduce pollution in other ways. The legislation, like the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> measure, would set deadlines ranging from five years to 20 years for cities to clean up their smog problems. But the placement of cities in the various categories would be different. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bill would give <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago-Gary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, 20 years to sharply reduce ozone levels in return for adopting severe anti-pollution measures. The <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> legislation would place only <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in the 20-year category and would give the other three areas 15 years. In all, 101 geographical areas have failed to meet the now-expired ozone cleanup timetables under current law. <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, explaining the lack of an alternative fuels requirement in his bill, said, `` I do n't think it's wise to mandate change in the marketplace so that certain users have to use certain kinds of cars.'' He also called the requirement a `` heavy-handed intrusion into the marketplace.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, on the other hand, calls its clean fuels requirement `` the most innovative and far-reaching component'' of its ozone-cutting proposals. The president would force a portion of the car fleet in the most seriously polluted cities to operate on clean-burning fuels such as methanol, ethanol, natural gas, electricity, propane or reformulated gasoline. The president wants a schedule for such vehicles, beginning with 500,000 cars sold nationally in the 1995 model year, and going up to one million cars in the model years 1997 through 2004. `` I'm not sure how you get people to buy that number of cars,'' <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> said.

 Rock star Sting suffered the slings and arrows of outraged theater critics Friday for his stage debut in `` The Threepenny Opera,'' but he was a smash hit with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador and <PERSON> Yulia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sukhanova </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s first beauty queen. With President and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> watching from box seats above the National Theater stage Thursday night, Sting made the best of a daunting, three-hour performance as <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> the Knife in the pre-Broadway premiere of <PERSON> Bertolt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brecht </PERSON>'s biting musical satire. The critics, however, agreed that Sting's best was n't good enough. `` Slow and turgid stuff,'' complained <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, who said Sting's `` acting has little resonance and his singing voice is surprisingly thin.'' `` If you're going to see Sting, prepare to be stung,'' said <PERSON> Hap </PERSON> <PERSON> Erstein </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, who said this `` Threepenny Opera'' proved `` to not be worth 2 cents'' despite a stellar cast directed by Tony Award winner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> and music conducted by <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudel </PERSON>. Many in the black-tie, opening night audience agreed that Sting _ who is accustomed to mega-decibel amplifiers at his huge stadium rock concerts _ desperately needs a body mike for <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weill </PERSON>'s bawdy songs in the intimate confines of a legitimate theater like the National. Sting himself, nearly crushed in the melee of fans at a post-performance party at the <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ebbitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grill </ORGANIZATION>, was pleased that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came backstage at the second intermission to greet the cast. `` He said he enjoyed the show, and so did <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>,'' Sting reported. Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> backstage, and the curtain for the final act was delayed when the two men stepped aside for an animated conversation alone. `` We did n't know if we were going to have a peace treaty ending the Cold War or a third act,'' said one cast member later. <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>, clearly enjoying the show, said <PERSON> Brecht </PERSON>'s plays are popular in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and that `` The Threepenny Opera'' often is performed there in Russian. `` It's the truth about life,'' he said, smilingly acknowledging that <PERSON> Brecht </PERSON> was an outspoken Marxist who rewrote the 18th century English satire, `` The Beggar's Opera,'' to espouse his political theories about religion, sex and morality in capitalist society. <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> said Thursday night's performance, in a fresh English translation by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Feingold </PERSON>, `` brought an American spirit to the spirit of <PERSON> Brecht </PERSON>'s epoch'' that is `` a good combination of the two.'' The ambassador's companion for the evening was Miss Sukhanova, a 17-year-old model and budding actress who recently was graduated from a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> high school for the arts. She was elected `` Miss U.S.S.R.'' in June during a beauty pageant in which Soviet television viewers called in their votes by telephone. Miss <PERSON> Sukhanova </PERSON> said she became a Sting fan when saw a television broadcast of the former lead singer and songwriter for the defunct rock group Police performing last year at a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> stadium concert. `` I'm not really in love with him, but I like him very much,'' she said through an interpreter at a post-performance party at the Old Ebbitt Grill also attended by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, actress <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON> and other celebrities. Miss <PERSON> Sukhanova </PERSON> managed to slip past other admirers crowding around Sting's table, including Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., and his 16-year-old daughter <PERSON> Karenna </PERSON>, to shake hands with her singing idol She said she blushed `` just a little'' when Sting gave her a compliment. `` She's too shy to say,'' the interpreter said, `` but he told her she was very beautiful.'' <PERSON> Feingold </PERSON> said there have been three movies and no fewer than six translations or adaptations of `` Threepenny Opera'' for the stage, but this is the most faithful recreation of the original, uncut version of the Brecht-Weill musical play of 1928. The show will open at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Nov. 5 after a four-week run at the National. `` We've got a lot of work to do,'' conceded producer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hellman </PERSON>, who also is making his theatrical debut after a string of movie hits.

<HEAD>Thousands March as Peaceful Protests Take Place `Without a Hitch'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

 About 15,000 people of all races marched through the heart of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> on Friday, and thousands more rallied in the capital in rare, government-approved demonstrations against police violence. The marches were among the largest ever in the two cities and illustrated the impact of President-elect F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s declaration this week that his white-led government will not block peaceful protests The only police action reported was against white hecklers. Police watched from nearly every window of their 12-story headquarters building in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, the nation's largest city, as protesters singing and carrying banners stopped nearby. Six clergymen went to the door of the building to present a petition against the use of police to stop peaceful protests. Only one clergyman, the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general-secretary of the South African Council of Churches, was allowed inside the building where he says he has twice been tortured during interrogation. `` The little space they have opened to give us the chance to show how peaceful we are has been used quite effectively,'' <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> said later. In the capital of <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, about 2,000 people gathered in the central Church Square, where police never had allowed protests to take place. Black youths chanting `` Viva!'' trotted around the square's lawn while about 60 police watched. Several demonstrators carrying banners reading `` Stop Police Brutality'' and `` Victory is Certain'' even climbed on a statue of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruger </PERSON>, one of the political patriarchs of the Afrikaners who now control the government. A right-wing, pro-apartheid party leader, <PERSON> Jaap </PERSON> <PERSON> Marais </PERSON>, called the climbing on the statue a desecration. Until this week, virtually all protest marches had been prohibited. But <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said Tuesday he would allow peaceful protests, and the next day more than 20,000 people streamed through <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> to protest police brutality. It was the largest such demonstration to be authorized by the government. Magistrates also granted approval for the protests Friday. In carrying out his policy to allow peaceful protest, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> faces opposition not only from right-wing parties but from the security establishment that enjoyed wide powers under his predecessor, P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s conservative opponents in Parliament on Thursday denounced his move, saying it undercut security officials. The independent <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said of Friday's protests, `` A potentially explosive mass demonstration by mainly blacks in one of Afrikaner Nationalism's citadels had gone off without a hitch. Smaller demonstrations also were held in the cities of <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Grahamstown </LOCATION>. `` One swallow does n't make a summer, neither do two or three freedom marches make a liberated country,'' Methodist Bishop <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Storey </PERSON> told a news conference after the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> march. He said the government should see the wisdom of negotiating with `` people who can mount an enormous march like that in a very tense situation in a polarized society.'' The petition the clergymen presented to police demanded an end to discriminatory and restrictive laws so that negotiations can begin on ending apartheid, which denies the nation's black majority a voice in national affairs. The <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> marchers included black youths, white professionals, nuns and prominent activists, including <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, wife of jailed black nationalist <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. Many youths carried posters demanding <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release and chanted `` ANC! <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>!'' the initials of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> movement. About 10,000 marchers began the protest, but the crowd swelled as spectators joined the passing parade. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> said he was particularly pleased that white office workers stepped off the sidewalks to join hands with blacks. He said the police officer who accepted the marchers' petition `` was a bit tense.'' `` Obviously they are frightened by this new reality. ... I believe some of the policemen were shocked. They have been told not to allow this and they do n't understand when they are told not to take action,'' he said. When <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> emerged from the station, he and <PERSON> Storey </PERSON> climbed a ladder to speak to the crowd from a concrete ledge and told the marchers to disperse, telling them, `` We have proved our point.'' The crowd joined <PERSON> Storey </PERSON> in a prayer, sang `` God Bless <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' the anthem of the anti-apartheid movement, and dispersed. Several thousand youths jogged and chanted <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> slogans on their way to bus and train stations to return home. Traffic officers cordoned off side streets as the 10-block-long procession marched more than a mile from <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> down streets that normally would have been clogged with traffic. <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> police led away two men shouting abuse at the protesters and <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> officers warned a white man who threw eggs at the parade. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> was elected to a five-year term Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, which is dominated by his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He had been acting president since Aug. 15, a day after he and other Cabinet members pressured <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to resign.

<HEAD>League of Cities President Asks for Big Hike in Drug-Fighting Budget</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 National League of Cities President <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> said Friday the federal drug-fighting budget for 1990 should be increased by $ 5 billion to $ 6 billion over the administration's proposed $ 7.9 billion, and that taxes should be raised to pay for it New resources are needed, said the mayor of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, and `` I have n't figured out another way to get new resources.'' Commenting on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s oft-stated opposition to new taxes _ `` Read my lips: no new taxes'' _ <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> said, `` Some of us are illiterate.'' The Democratic mayor said the strategy will call on state and local governments to spend $ 10 billion to $ 12 billion for drug testing and prisons next year alone. `` We believe that an equivalent resource from the federal government has got to be committed,'' he said. `` We've just gone through a bailout of the savings and loans, where really no questions were asked and the money simply appeared,'' he said. `` We are at the same level of urgency, or significantly greater level of urgency, because people are dying,'' he said. `` I'm not sure anybody died in the savings and loans. In fact, I'm pretty sure they did n't.'' <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON>, who was meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Friday afternoon, said paying for the strategy by taking funds away from immigration, juvenile justice and housing programs is a `` shell game.'' He likened such a rearrangement of resources to `` asking <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> to finance the <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> invasion by selling his landing craft. Those programs are important to establishing a climate in our cities which will keep drugs at bay.'' <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> called for a `` significant amount'' to be allocated directly to cities so they would n't run into a `` logjam'' of state bureaucracies, but he declined to say how much money the cities should get. He said he is asking municipal leaders to lobby <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, where some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> already are balking at a proposal by Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to increase the $ 7.9 billion by $ 2.2

 House tax-writers' narrow approval of a capital gains tax cut sought by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sets the stage for the first major leadership test of new House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and his top Democratic deputies. Over vehement objections from <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and other party leaders, six Democrats on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> joined 13 Republicans in a 19-17 vote Thursday to cut the tax. Committee Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., called his panel's action `` a financial disaster'' and `` ultimate expression of ` feel good' economics'' that could unravel the rate-equalizing, loophole-closing tax reforms of White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We are pleased by the vote and we will be working hard to sustain it on the floor.'' The plan approved by the committee would reduce the tax rate of 33 percent to 19.6 percent for the next 27 months. The tax rate then would rise to 28 percent but would be `` indexed'' to tax only increases exceeding the annual inflation rate. The net effect to taxpayers is similar to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign proposal to reduce the capital gains tax rate to 15 percent without indexing. The Ways and Means budget bill also lowers the premiums for catastrophic health insurance for the elderly and finances a massive increase in child-care subsidies for low-income families. The 1990 fiscal year begins Oct. 1. The six Democrats, led by Reps. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, resisted weeks of entreaties from <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> that the proposal is little more than a giveaway to the rich. `` The notion that wealthy Americans need another tax break at the expense of working people is ludicrous,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. `` Who's going to pay ... The answer is the ordinary, middle-income working American, that's who.'' Because the wealthy own most capital assets _ such as stocks, bonds and real estate _ they would benefit the most from the tax break. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that 80 percent of the $ 4 billion to $ 5 billion in benefits will go to taxpayers with incomes above $ 100,000 a year. Supporters contend a capital gains tax cut would help the economy by encouraging investment. Cutting the capital gains rate would bring in more tax money for the next three years, by provding incentives to sell such assets, according to government estimates. However, after that the reduction would cost the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> $ 2.8 billion to $ 5 billion a year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Taxation. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> expressed bitter frustration that one-fourth of his committee's Democrats sided with the 13 Republicans to give them a majority on more than a half-dozen votes aimed at whittling down the capital gains amendment cosponsored by <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. `` If the evident divisions within the committee are any indication, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is in for a painful fight,'' said <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>. Democrats voting with <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON> for the tax cut were Reps. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Flippo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. Republicans predicted they would pick up as many as 70 of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s 255 Democrats when the legislation moves to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor late this month. Other Democrats said it will take a carefully orchestrated campaign for a positive counterproposal to stop the momentum for giving <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> what he wants. `` There has to be a response from our party's perspective other than just being against,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, D-Mass. `` This will be <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s first real major decision.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said the Democrats were looking at a variety of alternatives, including raising the tax rate on high incomes and a plan advanced by Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, to partially restore tax deductions on contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts. The changes in the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> catastrophic health insurance plan and new child benefits were informally approved earlier. Over five years, lower-income families would receive an additional $ 14 billion in tax credits and $ 2 billion in state-administered grants aimed at improving child care for working parents. The major part of the increase would come from liberalizing the earned-income credit, which benefits lower-income working families with children. The credit would be worth more to larger families; it could range up to $ 1,790 a year for those with three or more children. A new credit of up to $ 430 a year would help families with children under the age of 6. In response to complaints from many retirees, the surtax financing catastrophic health insurance would be cut in half for the wealthiest 40 percent of retiree, s but the flat monthly premium paid by all but the poorest <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries would rise. The bill would allow retirees to turn down catastrophic coverage but only if they opt out of <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Part </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> B </ORGANIZATION>, which pays physicians' fees

 Counterintelligence officials said Friday they are worried <LOCATION> Communist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> may have slipped spies among refugees coming from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, and they promised to help any spies who turn themselves in. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has been a playground for spies since the advent of the Cold War, with agents from several <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries snooping around for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> military secrets and sensitive high-tech know-how. Some of the hundreds of spies caught in the past were East Germans who came over to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> either as escapees or as legal emigres. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON>, vice president of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s main counterintelligence agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said there may have been agents or would-be agents among the recent flood of East German refugees to the West. `` This is a possibility we must reckon with. It's something we must be alert to,'' said <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON>. He appealed to any East German refugees who have `` obligated themselves'' to East German intelligence to telephone the <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION>. `` We can help them,'' he said. <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON> said that even if a refugee had committed himself to spy for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, he would not be prosecuted if he had not yet begun his work. Intelligence officials say dramatically reduced East-West tensions have not reduced East bloc espionage. Sixty suspected spies were nabbed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> last year, compared with 34 the year before. A 69-year-old man was arrested last month for allegedly acting as an East German informer more than 30 years.

The disclosure shocked the nation and resulted in <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>'s resignation There also have been instances of so-called `` Romeo spies'' coming to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from the East and building a seemingly innocent life with a respectable job, but at some point romancing government secretaries, exchanging love and companionship for secrets. West German intelligence officials say they have no indications there are spies among the estimated 14,000 East Germans who arrived in the past week but that the possibility can not be excluded. <PERSON> Hans-Gert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said that sometimes East Germans who ask to leave for the West are first coerced into making deals with East German intelligence. `` Permission to leave would be dependent on making an agreement. If they climb to important positions -LRB- in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> -RRB- where they might be useful, the agreement could be activated,'' he said.

<HEAD>Industrial Production Rose 0.3 Percent In August</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Industrial production recorded its biggest gain in four months in August, the government said Friday in a report that drew mixed reaction to the 0.3 percent gain. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the August production rate followed revised increases of 0.1 percent in July and 0.2 percent in June after remaining flat in May. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> originally had reported production rose 0.2 percent in July, but fell 0.1 percent in both May and June. Production was up 0.7 percent in April. `` That's not only stronger than expected, but the revisions were substantial. The economy never really slowed down,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm. However, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacReynolds </PERSON>, forecasting director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said the gain was only 2.8 percent over August of last year after rising 5.7 percent in 1988. `` Growth in the manufacturing sector has been sluggish throughout 1989, falling farther behind the growth in the services sector,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> credited almost all the August growth to a rebound in production at auto factories and a pickup in coal mining following a strike. `` Excluding motor vehicles, output of both consumer goods and business equipment was sluggish during the summer,'' it said. At the same time, the central bank reported that the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities remained unchanged at 83.8 percent of capacity in August. The operating rate measures not only output, but also changes in productivity levels. Factory use had declined 0.1 percentage point in June, the central bank said. The rate had hit a 10-year high of 84.3 percent in December 1988 and last January. Last month's operating rate also was unchanged from August 1988. `` Unchanged capacity utilization in August signals the likelihood that inflationary pressures have declined substantially in the last several months,'' <PERSON> MacReynolds </PERSON> said. The closer <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry gets to full operating capacity, the greater difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading to shortages and price increases. Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or above as an indication of inflationary pressures. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has been walking a fine line of keeping interest rates high enough to cool inflationary pressures without slowing growth so much that the economy slides into a recession. Industrial production at manufacturing plants making both durable and non-durable goods rose 0.2 percent last month after remaining flat in July and increasing 0.3 percent in June. Output was up 2.3 percent at mines and oil wells but fell 1 percent at utilities. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said its industrial production index in August stood at 142.4 percent of its 1977 base, up from 142 percent in July. At the same time, the operating rate rose 0.1 percentage point to 84 percent at manufacturing plants. The rate had peaked at 84.7 percent in January. The rate at factories producing durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last more than three years _ rose 0.2 percentage point to 82.6 percent. The rate at factories producing non-durable goods fell from 86.4 percent in July to 86.1 percent in August.

 A senior East German official said Friday the exodus of East Germans to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is hurting his country's economy. Opposition leaders formed a new organization to challenge the hard-line Communist government. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> of enticing the refugees and compared it to the `` Home to the Reich'' slogan used during the Nazi expansionism in the 1930s. Despite appeals for reforms to slow the refugee flow, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has hardened its stance. That included the cancellation Friday of a planned visit by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, who traditionally have pleaded for better relations with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Sindermann </PERSON> accused the Social Democrats of planning a `` confrontation'' next week with the Communist government. Most of the East Germans who have left since <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> opened its border to the West at midnight Sunday are young, well-educated people. East German <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> said the goverment will have to find ways to bridge the gap resulting from their loss. `` It certainly wo n't be easy,'' <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> said during a visit to <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>. `` Naturally, it's not unproblematical for us that skilled workers, whether young or old, from the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> are resettling in the Federal Republic of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, who heads the 9.5-million member state labor union, claimed there were no official plans to restrict East Germans' travels to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> However, sources in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> have said that it has become more difficult to get permission to travel to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> ally. Also Friday, 12 well known opposition leaders, including physicist <PERSON> Hans-Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischbeck </PERSON>, announced the formation of the `` Citizens Initiative for Democracy Now.'' The group signed a petition demanding `` widespread reforms nationwide.'' The Central Committee member in charge of the East German economy rejected all such calls, including those coming from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government and the Social Democrats. `` The reform proposals of those people contain only one point: they want the type of reform that does away with socialism,'' the official, <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON>, wrote in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION>. `` It just wo n't be that way!'' He called on those left behind to do everything possible to strengthen the nation. <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> also bitterly attacked <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` With promises, enticements and also with psychological pressure, they have organized a movement along the well known model of ` Home to the <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>,''' <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> wrote. `` Have they forgotten what that led to?'' `` Home to the Reich'' was used as a slogan for the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>' aims to unite all Germans living in Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> into <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Third Reich.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, deliberating less than an hour, approved a $ 7.7 billion military construction bill Friday that eliminates President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request for work on bases in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. `` The best way to make our defense dollar go further is to secure a more equitable burden sharing from our allies,'' Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommitte on military construction, said prior to the chamber's overwhelming approval of the bill The vote was 93-1 with Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., the lone dissenter Overall, the bill, covering the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, provides $ 1.3 billion less than this year's level for military construction and about $ 300 million less than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had requested. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> blueprint also differs from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version, which totals $ 8.7 billion, including $ 500 million for base closings that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has put in the separate defense appropriations bill. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will meet later this month to fashion a compromise. Prior to the vote, <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> told his colleagues that uncertainity regarding the level of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces overseas led to major cuts in the legislation. `` This bill provides for no new military construction on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. Due to disputes and discussions, it's unwise to move forward with any new construction,'' <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said. The legislation cuts $ 85.5 million from the $ 86.3 million <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> requested for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The House earmarked $ 74.2 million for construction there. Several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have called for reductions in the 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Sens. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., and <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., on Thursday proposed a reduction of 3,000 troops during committee consideration of the defense spending bill, but later withdrew their The lawmakers indicated they would introduce the measure when the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> took up the bill. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spends $ 2.6 billion a year to maintain its troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said the decision to cut all $ 40.8 million the president requested for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> was based on upcoming negotiations on a new treaty to replace the Military Bases Agreement. The U.S.-Philippines pact under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> leases <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and Subic Bay Naval Base will expire in September 1991. Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to say whether she favors keeping the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases, but a Philippine <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution introduced last month seeks to close the bases. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is expected to discuss the issue when she visits <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in November. While cutting money for overseas projects, the subcommittee added $ 250 million to the bill for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and reserves in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had requested $ 452.6 million. The subcommittee also cut $ 50 million from the president's request of $ 101.5 million for housing the B-2 stealth bomber at the <ORGANIZATION> Whiteman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> The reduction mirrors the action taken in the authorization bill and reflects the delay in the program. <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, in recommending approval of the legislation, said the bill `` continues the priorities adopted over the last several years and provides adequately for our most pressing military construction needs.''

 Nobel laureate <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> may have developed an infection that poses a new danger to her health following a heart attack last week, her cardiologist said Friday. Another doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity said too many visitors and doctors may be hampering <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>'s chances for recovery. Dr. <PERSON> Vincenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilotta </PERSON>, a heart specialist from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and a longtime friend of <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, said the 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun is fighting a persistent fever and chest pains. `` With the high temperature, her condition is still serious,'' said <PERSON> Bilotta </PERSON>, who treated <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> for a similar ailment in 1985. `` Her heart is very weak. The infection is now posing a new danger to her,'' he added, without saying where the infection may have developed. Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombardi </PERSON>, an infectious disease specialist from <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said doctors are trying to find the cause of the infection. <PERSON> Lombardi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bilotta </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION> earlier in the week to help treat <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her devotion to the destitute and dying. A statement from <LOCATION> Woodlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nursing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Home </LOCATION>, where she was admitted last week, said `` Mother is still running a temperature. She has had a mild episode of chest pain which rapidly responded to treatment.'' <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> developed chest pains and high fever Thursday just as doctors thought she was recovering well from a heart attack suffered Sept. 8. A senior physician said Friday she may have suffered a setback because too many doctors want to treat her and too many people want to visit her. `` What can the hospital management do if the prime minister, the chief minister, the health minister and other dignitaries keep coming to visit?'' he said on condition of anonymity.

 Angolan rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> will visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> next month to meet with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, possibly including President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, official and private sources said Friday. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, who heads the Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has been invited by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and will arrive here Oct. 2, said a source close to his organization. `` A meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is under consideration, but it's quite possible,'' said an administration official who asked not to be named. The official said <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> would brief the administration about the precarious peace talks between his organization and the Marxist government of <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>. He is also expected to discuss the terms of the truce accord and to ask for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support in achieving closer <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring of the pullout of an estimated 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and the government agreed on a truce to end their 14-year war at a meeting in <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> last June, but the cease-fire collapsed soon after and hundreds have died in the ensuing clashes. The agreement has also been endangered by questions about <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s fate. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> contends <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> agreed to go into temporary exile and integrate his troops into the Angolan military. But <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> denied this and accused the Angolans of lying about the closed-door meeting in <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been seeking to bring the sides back to the negotiating table and a meeting has been scheduled for Monday in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION>. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> this week to help arrange the meeting. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has promised <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> that it will maintain its military and financial support of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> until a final peace agreement is reached which allows free elections. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which backs the government in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, has also pledged its support until peace is achieved. The Angolan peace talks are a result of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet-sponsored agreement signed last December for the pullout of some 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The pullout has been conducted according to plan and is expected to be completed on schedule in 1991. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, who once studied in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, last visited here in 1988 and met with former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Bill Envisions Large-Scale Effort to Make Fish Safe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A House panel began considering a bill Friday that would require health inspection of fish and shellfish, the first effort to establish a comprehensive program to regulate the fishing industry. `` Currently, many consumers are wary about the safety of fish,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., who introduced the bill `` They have heard many stories about contamination from toxic industrial and agricultural chemicals, medical waste products and red tides.'' The `` Fish and Fish Products Safety Act of 1989'' would require setting safety standards for contaminants for fish and establishing a rigorous and comprehensive inspection system. Officials say it is more difficult to regulate fishing than the meat or poultry industry because there are 300 edible species of fish in vast waters. Contaminants for fish and shellfish include the botulism toxin, salmonella bacteria and the hepatitis-A virus, as well as PCBs and other industrial contaminants. Dr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, testified before <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health and the environment that fish consumption increased to 15.4 pounds person in 1987 largely because the food is low in fat. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> inspects only a quarter of the fish-processing plants each year. He said data from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> `` indicate that seafood does not cause illness in alarming amounts or diversity.'' However, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit group that deals with food safety issues, disagreed. She offered a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> study that indicated that the risk of a food poisoning outbreak from eating seafood is 25 times greater from seafood than from beef, and 16 times greater than for either chicken or pork. Dr. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, administrator of the food safety and inspection service at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` building on the existing meat and poultry inspection program structure would provide a faster start up and extensive cost-savings for a fish and seafood inspection program.'' Legislation has been introduced in the past to give the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> authority over seafood inspections, just as it is in charge of meat and poultry inspections. The <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> bill would make the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> the lead agency. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said in his opening statement Friday that `` the most contentious issue has become one of turf _ where authority over the new fish inspection program should be vested.''

<HEAD>Egyptian Plan Presented to Israel's Divided Leaders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s four top leaders quarreled heatedly Friday over an <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks that threatens to divide the Jewish state's coalition government. A <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official who requested anonymity said the left-leaning party sees `` no need to stay in the government'' if Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc does not agree to the talks. The two parties are divided over the Egyptian plan's insistence on a U.S.-backed formula of trading occupied territory for peace. In the occupied territories Friday, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot and killed two Palestinian youths, including a 12-year-old. The army said soldiers did not open fire in the area where the child was killed. A spokesman for Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, said Egyptian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassiouny </PERSON> on Friday formally presented <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders with Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s proposal. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> discussed the plan. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported they disagreed sharply about the proposals, which the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> supports. A major controversy is <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s offer to sponsor peace talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a 12-member Palestinian delegation, including two Arabs deported from the occupied territories. This is intended to satisfy both <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s demand to talk only to Palestinians from the territories and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s insistence that Palestinians living abroad be included. `` Deportees are not exactly outside Palestinians ... I would not be quick to reject this possibility,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said in an interview with the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. Israeli newspapers identified possible negotiators as deportees <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Milhem </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> mayor, and <PERSON> Akram </PERSON> <PERSON> Haniyeh </PERSON>, formerly a newspaper editor in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, both senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials. The <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc is balking about negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> brands a terrorist organization. `` We have closed the door to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, so the Egyptians have decided to push the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> through the window,'' <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Eliyahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Elissar </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. Transport Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzav </PERSON>, also of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, told the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> that anyone who accepts the plan `` wants to break up the national unity government.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> wants to resolve the deadlock before visits to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> next week by <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who leaves Saturday and is scheduled to meet President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said in an interview published in Friday's <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in promoting <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s proposal is crucial. Palestinian sources in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> said Friday the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> council </ORGANIZATION> will consider the Egyptian plan in mid-October. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> reporters said <PERSON> Tarek </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuffah </PERSON>, 12, was killed by an army sniper during a stone-throwing riot. An army spokesman said troops did not fire in the area. The spokesman said a patrol commander shot and killed a second Palestinian when troops were attacked by youths throwing iron bars and cement blocks. Arab reporters said <PERSON> Ata </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, 18, was killed in a clash with troops during <PERSON> Tuffah </PERSON>'s funeral. Six other Palestinians were reported shot and wounded by the army. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, masked Arab assailants hacked and seriously wounded a 35-year-old woman accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Friday's deaths raised the toll to 570 Palestinians killed in the 21-month-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Forty Israelis have died, and 114 suspected collaborators have been killed by fellow Palestinians.

 Welsh soccer fans rampaged through a seaside suburb early Friday, fighting <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> fans and damaging three taverns before police arrested 14 of them, authorities said.

<HEAD>Bush Vows Flexibility in Funding Drug War as Jackson Blasts Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised Friday to be flexible amid Democratic demands for a boost in drug war spending, while the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the plan fails to `` match the breadth of this social crisis.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters after a luncheon in the State Dining Room that he still prefers the $ 7.9 billion drug war he unveiled on national television last week but added, `` we're flexible.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, testifying on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, told lawmakers that the `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan does not wage war on material and spiritual poverty, which are the preconditions for the drug crisis.'' He said the plan underestimates the arsenals of drug dealers, lacks sufficient funds and needs input from national and community leaders with extensive experience in fighting the drug problem. Their remarks cae as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators of both parties met for two hours and broke reporting progress in the quest for a financing compromise. `` It was a good step,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, told a news conference following the `` At this point, I would say that everything is very much on the table,'' Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., said But a <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> plan to generate an additional $ 2.2 billion for the drug war with a half-percent, across-the-board cut in federal programs, opposed by the administration, remained part of a transportation bill awaiting final action. The administration is opposed to the cut, which would slice $ 1.8 billion out of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s budget. <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> said Republicans would present an alternative financing plan when the 18-member negotiating task force returns to the bargaining table Monday. Repeated applause and a few shouts of approval from spectators marked <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> select committee on narcotics. `` We need a new initiative equal to the scope and depth of the problem,'' the former Democratic presidential hopeful said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> shook hands warmly with national drug policy director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who preceded him as a witness at the hearing, but his remarks were sharply critical of both <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` In April, Mr. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> announced that he would take comprehensive emergency action to attack the drug crisis in the nation's capital,'' he said. `` Five months later, we still have the emergency but no action.'' `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced a drug plan for <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Where is his plan for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and cities around the nation?'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who is believed to be weighing a race for mayor of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> suggested that the president should convene a meeting at Camp David to draft a new policy on drugs and include national and community leaders with experience in fighting the problem, including himself. He also said the nation's capital could become a model for fighting the drug scourge. Asked what his own role in that project would be, he said, `` A volunteer.''

<HEAD>Space Shuttle Crew Ends Rehearsal, Plans Vice Presidential Visit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The crew of space shuttle Atlantis concluded a two-day countdown rehearsal Friday and traveled to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a meeting with Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. The practice session, intended to mimic the 24 hours leading to an actual launch, went smoothly despite two computer glitches that delayed the end of the countdown, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said. Soon after wrapping up the rehearsal, the five astronauts boarded their T-38 jets for a flight to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. White House officials said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> planned to meet commander <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and his crewmates Saturday at breakfast. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> comes from <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s home state of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> expressed a desire to say hello to the crew sometime before we fly,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told reporters Thursday. `` I invited him to be a launch guest, but we'll be pretty busy and wo n't be able to visit with him on launch morning.'' The rehearsal ended at 11:10 a.m. EDT, about 10 minutes later than planned, because launch crews needed extra time to investigate two problems in computers monitoring the shuttle's systems. The astronauts and their support crews carried the dress rehearsal to its finish, even though stormy weather near the Kennedy Space Center would have prevented an actual liftoff. Atlantis' liftoff is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 12. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> will not set a firm date until a two-day flight readiness review is completed Oct. 3. The astronauts were aboard Atlantis for the final two hours of the countdown during the dry run. In addition to <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the crew members are pilot <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCully </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucid </PERSON>. During the first day of the five-day flight, the astronauts are to dispatch the nuclear-powered <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft on the start of a six-year voyage to explore Jupiter and its moons. Anti-nuclear activists have said they will try to block the launch, either by court action or by trespassing at the launch site, because the probe is powered by two generators fueled by plutonium-238. They are afraid an accident during launch would sprinkle hazardous radioactive fallout on communities surrounding the Kennedy Space Center. Similar nuclear generators have provided electrical power on 22 previous <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space flights, including the six manned Apollo moon missions and the Voyager 2 probe, which recently sent back pictures of the planet <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. The five astronauts on the mission say they are confident the nuclear generators are safe.

<HEAD>Democratic Leaders Fighting Party Split on Capital Gains</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Democratic leaders on Friday began a struggle to recoup from their loss to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his capital gains tax cut, portraying their position as a fight for the working class. But conservative Democrats said their leaders were choosing the wrong issue _ and Republicans eagerly tried to exploit the rift in the majority party's ranks. In a 19-17 vote on Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved a capital gains tax cut after six Democrats defected and went against their party to side with the president. Democratic leaders on Friday made clear that they would take the fight to the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and that they hoped the public would be on their side after deciding who would win and who would lose if the tax cut is approved. They said they had n't settled on what kind of alternative to offer, but among the possibilities was including a restoration of Individual Retirement Account tax breaks as first proposed by Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. The issue has emerged as the thorniest in a massive budget bill that also includes the sensitive issues of child care and revision of the tax for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> catastrophic illness coverage. Strategists involved in the situation were pondering the possibility that the whole bill might collapse if forces opposed to various provisions combined to bring it down. Rep. <PERSON> Steny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON>, D-Md., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, said the cut was `` at the wrong time giving relief to the wrong people It's obviously a benefit that will be largely enjoyed by the 150-to-200-thousand-plus crowd.'' Reminded that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tried unsuccessfully to make a campaign issue out of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support of a capital gains cut, <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> still said, `` My gut tells me the average <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agrees with our position.'' House Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination last year based on populist themes, was leading the rhetorical attack for the Democratic leaders `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to give a tax cut to the wealthy, and send the bill to average working Americans,'' he said. House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., facing the toughest test yet of his three-month-old tenure, put his deputies to work crafting an alternative to offer on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor when debate begins later this month But Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga., who co-sponsored the version of the capital gains cut approved by the committee, said it was n't just Republicans who thought the proposal was a good one for all taxpayers, one that would spur investment and improve the economy His own party's leaders, he said, were making a `` terrible mistake'' by portraying capital gains as a partisan issue. `` If enough Democrats will continue to support it and get out front, we can save the party from itself,'' he said. Republicans saw the Democratic division as a return to the politics early in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term, when <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> could team up with `` <PERSON> Boll </PERSON> <PERSON> Weevil </PERSON>'' <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> to push through parts of the president's program. Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., the House Minority Whip, spoke Friday of `` the common sense coalition of Democrats and Republicans. He and <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> both said there would be a tough fight on the House floor. The capital gains plan approved Thursday would cut the current maximum rate of 33 percent to 19.6 percent for 27 months. Thereafter, the rate would rise to 28 percent but any gains would be taxed only on the amount exceeding the annual inflation rate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his campaign, promised to fight for a 15 percent rate, but the net effect on taxpayers of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> proposal is similar to that because of the indexing for inflation. The White House immediately announced the president would fight for the committee-approved plan. The fight is likely to be a muddy one, because the capital gains provision is part of a huge budget bill that includes some of this year's toughest issues _ with more battles almost certain on each one. The bill would provide lower-income families additional tax credits and state-administered grants to help working parents find child care. Liberals and conservatives want to move the final version in opposite directions. In response to a rash of complaints, the bill would halve the surtax financing catastrophic health insurance for the wealthiest 40 percent of retirees, but the flat monthly premium paid by all but the poorest <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries would rise. The bill would allow retirees to turn down catastrophic coverage but only if they opt out of <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Part </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> B </ORGANIZATION>, which pays physicians' fees But many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> want to repeal the law altogether, and the showdown on that issue could come on this bill. Other issues include new restrictions on `` dial-a-porn'' telephone services, on the Fairness Doctrine to require broadcasters to give time to opposing views, on expansion of the Medicaid health program for the poor, and a variety of new tax provisions affecting businesses.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Friday he has n't read a book about his 1988 presidential run that says he retreated into `` a two-month shell'' after a flap that rocked his campaign in September 1987. The incident that forced the resignation of campaign manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, a close friend and adviser to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, was described in `` All by Myself,'' a book written by <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> reporters <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliphant </PERSON>. `` He missed <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> personally and politically, and worried about him,'' they wrote of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate, and said he became `` flat as a pancake out on the hustings.'' `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' glum mood was also reflected in an almost petulant unwillingness to try new material in his speeches,'' according to the account. `` I have n't read it. I think it's clear we did a good job winning the nomination and not as good a job winning the final. There's no sense crying over spilt milk,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a brief interview during an international trade conference at the Statehouse. He said he is concentrating on his responsibilities as governor, and not rehashing the campaign. `` I spent most of yesterday preparing for the education summit,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, referring to the meeting later this month of the nation's governors and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican who defeated him. The book quoted <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, who replaced <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> as campaign manager, as saying <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would `` return from the road convinced that no one liked him.'' <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> was described as `` bothered by his mopey moods,'' while campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said the candidate entered `` a two-month shell.'' <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> was forced to resign in September 1987 after it was disclosed that he had secretly distributed a videotape showing that Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rival for the Democratic nomination, was appropriating as his own campaign speeches made by <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> acted without the knowledge of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who publicly denied his campaign had any role in providing the videotape. The account also described how <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeatedly rejected appeals from campaign aides to go on the attack against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The book outlined an advertising effort that at one point produced 1,200 unused scripts for commercials. Although he once had a double-digit lead over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the polls, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> found himself trailing after the Republican National Convention in August 1988. It was n't until the closing days of the campaign that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> went on the attack, using the populist theme, `` I'm on your side.'' He closed the gap somewhat but on election day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> carried 40 states.

 About $ 32 milllion of cocaine hidden in containers of asphalt was seized and eight people arrested when Dutch authorities intercepted a drug shipment from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, law enforcement officials said Friday. Among those arrested were three Colombians and a Belgian, but <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> officials declined to further identify the suspects. The arrests Thursday night capped six months of detective work, and coincided with the delivery of the drugs, which were concealed in 21 barrels of asphalt at an abandoned dairy plant near this southern city, according to police spokesman <PERSON> Carel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouwman </PERSON>. It was not immediately where the cocaine originated, but <PERSON> Bouwman </PERSON> said it crossed the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> aboard a Venezuelan container ship that arrived earlier this month in <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION>, a Belgian port 30 miles from <LOCATION> Tilburg </LOCATION>.

 A jury of teen-agers let two boys walk on charges of stealing a bicycle but convicted two others of automobile theft in a courtroom experiment to let young scofflaws be judged by their peers. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> had the final say Thursday and partially disagreed with the verdicts of the six-member jury from <ORGANIZATION> Zephyrhills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. It was the first of semimonthly sessions endorsed by judges, educators and <LOCATION> Pasco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials. The jury, volunteers from a class on the law, deliberated about 20 minutes before finding a 14-year-old boy and a 16-year-old boy innocent of stealing the bicycle, but <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> overruled the panel. He explained to the jurors there was enough proof to support a guilty verdict. The judge withheld a finding of guilt, placed the pair on probation and ordered them to pay restitution. The jury contended that the prosecutor, a real one, never tied the boys to the theft and that others were involved but avoided getting hauled into court. `` If they got off with it the others should have, too,'' said juror <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Chancery </PERSON>, a senior. In the other case, the jury found two boys guilty of auto theft but innocent of a burglary charge. This time, the judge agreed. `` I thought you were very astute,'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> told the jury. The boys, whose ages were not available, will be punished later this month by the judge. Teacher <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Brendle </PERSON> said the experiment is a lively way for students to learn about the law and also should serve as a deterrent to youngsters who face criminal charges.

 The huge store of information in the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could be made available to libraries and scholars across the country through an improved computer network, the nation's chief librarian said Friday. `` The Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the national library community want to help develop a national research and education network,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Billington </PERSON>, the librarian of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. `` The major information resources for this nation reside in the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and other research libraries across the country.

 The judge in the trial of D.L. `` Danny'' <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> and six others declared a mistrial Friday after jurors said they were hopelessly deadlocked in the largest savings and loan fraud case. After deliberating for more than 16 days on the 88-count indictment, jurors told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> they could not come to an agreement. `` I know we're disappointed a verdict has not been reached in this case,'' <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> told jurors. `` But I'm not disappointed in your performance.'' He told jurors that a gag order remained in effect. It was not immediately clear how the jury was split. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said the case would be retried. <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> showed no emotion as the mistrial was announced, but 10 minutes later he fought back tears as he talked to reporters in the courthouse lobby. `` I think it's been really hard on us,'' <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> said. `` I want to be remembered for the nice things I've done, not this.'' Co-defendant and former Garland Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Toler </PERSON> put his arm around his wife as he walked out of the courtroom and said, `` Let's go to the showers Get ready to fight again.'' <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Toler </PERSON> are accused of heading a conspiracy to steal $ 135 million from <ORGANIZATION> Empire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mesquite </ORGANIZATION> and four other S & amp; Ls in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> in 1982 and 1983. The other defendants, former Empire chairman <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blain </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>; former <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L employee <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Arlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>; former real-estate salesman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Cansler </PERSON> and land appraisers <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Formann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tannehill </PERSON>, also were accused of conspiracy. There was little reaction from the defendants or the prosecutors when the judge announced the mistrial. Defendants and their attorneys shook hands, and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and two other prosecutors left the courtroom immediately. Several jurors were frowning as they entered the courtroom for <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON>' announcement. The cordial atmosphere that was evident during the six months of testimony had dissolved. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> to poll the jurors, but the request was denied. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Fawer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Towler </PERSON>'s attorney, called the mistrial `` an absolutely crushing defeat for the government.'' `` The government took its best shot, and they have not been able to win a case under the best possible circumstances,'' <PERSON> Fawer </PERSON> said. `` And I think they should leave these people in peace and let them get on with their lives.'' The indictment charged the seven with defrauding the savings and loans through fanciful real-estate appraisals and sham land transactions along Interstate 30 in <LOCATION> Garland </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Prosecutors said the defendants gave themselves private jets, expensive watches and even a $ 4 million mansion with the money they borrowed ostensibly to buy land and condominiums. All the defendants except <PERSON> Formann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tannehill </PERSON> were charged with a count of racketeering, which allows the government to confiscate illegal profits. The government had accused the defendants of receiving $ 135 million from the alleged scheme. After hearing six months of testimony in which 120 witnesses testified and more than 3,000 documents were introduced, the jury began deliberations Aug. 23. The defense called no witnesses, but attorneys contended in two days of final arguments the defendants were victims both of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' economic collapse in the mid-1980s and of the government's key witness, real-estate salesman <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> The defendants contend that <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges, is entirely responsible for planning the looting of the savings and loans and he is falsely implicating them to get his 13-year sentence reduced. When Empire was closed by regulators in 1984, it was the largest collapse of a thrift in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. Prosecutors said the defendants were partly to blame. The $ 279 million Empire collapse heralded the failures of other thrifts soon after, when oil and real-estate prices plummeted. Unlike some of the smaller trials involving thrifts, there were no charges of using depositors' money to buy influence or sex. Instead, testimony consisted of a mind-numbing array of numbers recounted by witnesses describing dozens of real-estate transactions in excruciating detail.

 Business inventories climbed 0.6 percent in July, the biggest gain in three months, while total business sales fell by 0.9 percent, the government reported Friday. While the combination of falling sales and rising inventories would normally spark recession fears, analysts for the most part dismissed Friday's report. `` The rise in business inventories is potentially a problem, but when it is taken in context with other data, it is not very worrisome,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Supporting this view, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that industrial production posted a 0.3 percent increase in August, the best showing in four months, reflecting a rebound in production at auto plants. Economists said this increase in industrial output, along with a rise in retail sales in August, was an encouraging sign that factories would not be scaling back production plans for fear that output was getting ahead of demand. Many analysts believe that outside of the auto industry, inventories have been kept at fairly lean levels and they are predicting that overall production will post moderate gains for the rest of the year. For July, the 0.6 percent rise in inventories, the largest since a 0.9 percent May increase, pushed the total stockpile of unsold goods to a seasonally adjusted $ 785.5 billion. It was led by a 1.1 percent rise in inventories held by manufacturers. Inventories at the retail level rose 0.3 percent while wholesale inventories were unchanged. The 0.9 percent plunge in total sales matched a similar decline in February and was the largest sales setback since a 3 percent drop in January 1987. The July decrease left total sales at a seasonally adjusted level of $ 511.09 billion Sales at the manufacturing level fell by 1.8 percent while sales by wholesalers were off 0.8 percent. Retail sales were the only area of strength, rising by 0.5 percent in July. In an indication of further improvement, the government said Thursday that retail sales in August were up 0.7 percent, reflecting a surge in auto sales. The combination of falling sales and rising inventories pushed the ratio of inventories to sales to 1.54 in July, meaning that it would take 1.54 months to exhaust inventories at the July sales pace.

 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> says he will help a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coalition of Hispanic leaders form a binational commission to address problems facing residents on both sides of the border. Intent on solidifying ties with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the organization IMPACTO 2000 met with <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> for 45 minutes Thursday night to outline their plan. It was <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' first trip to <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> since he took office Dec. 1. The proposal would create cooperatives to deal with cross-border issues including commerce, education, immigration, culture and health care. Saying positive changes already are occurring in several of those areas in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the president told 300 delegates of the group that he welcomed the plan and would direct various Mexican agencies to begin preparing the framework to deal with some of the issues. `` We will continue to work. We have a good relationship with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and an especially harmonious relationship with the Mexican-American community,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said. `` We will continue that relationship with the future generations of Mexican-Americans.'' The coalition, which wants to spur progress on these problems by the year 2000, includes representatives from churches, immigration centers, Hispanic elected officials and Hispanic professional and student groups such as the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> and the GI Forum. The proposal submitted to <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> seeks to create a binational commission that would include Mexican agencies and leaders from those business, education, church, student and labor sectors. It excludes the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Calif.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was left out because it has underestimated <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s relationship with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for too long. However, <ORGANIZATION> IMPACTO </ORGANIZATION> realizes that the growing Hispanic population in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is an issue that has to be addressed, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said. About 20 million Hispanics live in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today, 62 percent of them born there, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said. He said projections indicate half of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s residents by 2030 will be Hispanic. Members of the 4-year-old coalition met with <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> last year and the president promised to listen to their proposal after he was elected.

 The cancer that would kill him was already at work. He could n't lift weights or walk young men and women into breathlessness any more. But <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> refused to be a sick man; he did n't want to talk about that. He was the first poet laureate of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and he had a speech to write. I drove him and his wife, <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON>, from his summer home in <LOCATION> Stratton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, to a hospital in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Even about that there was a sense of adventure. Would we get lost? Stuck in a snowbank? There could be no such thing as disaster. He told me his daughter <PERSON> Rosanna </PERSON> had been born at home during a snowstorm, no doctors could get to the house. That was an adventure too. But perhaps only in retrospect. We discussed poetry, the news, war and rock music. You could n't be depressed around him It seemed silly. Mr. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> _ I never called him anything else, though his nickname was ` Red,' for the red hair of his youth _ was generous enough to let me think of him as a friend. I took the last class he taught at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, a writing course given in the fall of 1972. He was 67 then, the author of `` All The King's Men. What more could he do, I thought. That was a book from the 1940s. At first it was awful. He was an old-fashioned teacher. He did n't like fools, and did n't seem to believe in give-and-take in the classroom Sometimes he looked like a crocodile. Then he read <PERSON> Rudyard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kipling </PERSON>'s story `` The Man Who Would Be King'' to the class. It was amazing that his high-pitched <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> accent _ he never lost it despite years in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> _ could recreate the dry mountains of northern <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. He invited the class to his house for dinner, introduced us to leading literary lights _ `` This is <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hersey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>.'' I was drinking bourbon because I did n't want to seem like a wimp. Nervous, I emptied my glass quickly. `` You look like you need a DRINK,'' he said, refilling my glass. After about six of those I went downstairs and took a nap on the dining room floor. That's where I was when the first guests walked in for supper. He liked that. He came from a generation that thought it romantic to drink to oblivion daily. Though he cut down in later years, I stayed up with him a couple of times. What I could n't do was get up the next morning, lift weights and take a two-mile walk. Then it was time to work. Work. People who telephoned him in the morning got an awful shock. He'd answer, but you were interrupting work. He did n't much like telephones anyway. He once wrote a poem called `` Little Black Heart of the Telephone.'' At the time I did n't understand why that might be important. I did n't understand how easy it was to lose time, how hard it is to concentrate and get more than three things done in a day. How hard it was for a man to keep producing after winning two Pulitzer Prizes. He `` retired'' from <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, then he won his third Pulitzer. He did n't particularly need it. What he needed was the work. Mr. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> taught me a lot of things, few of them in class. He taught by example, by his energy, by his love of truth and beauty, by his sense of adventure. He and his wife taught me and many others that it's possible for two competitive people to love each other and have a happy marriage. Mrs. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> writes under the name <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. Their tennis court is a memorial to the National Book Award _ it was built with her prize money. None of those prizes stopped them from wearing funny hats on New Year's Eve. There is a final memory, my favorite. He told me later he'd thought I was his stupidest student because I never talked in class Finally he called me in for a private conference. Somehow I mentioned that I had just read <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennyson </PERSON>'s poem `` Ulysses'' for the first time. The last line has become a cliche, but I thought it was stunning when read as the climax to a great poem. He almost leaped out of his chair and yelped, `` It's a MAGNIFICENT poem.'' I started reciting the first lines planning to make some learned comment, or rather some comment that would make me seem learned. Instead, he simply joined me. Together we recited the whole poem. I could not believe I was remembering it all, but it seemed easy. The poem describes <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON>' years after the Trojan wars and his 10-year homeward Odyssey, old but still determined to push on to new adventure in spite of all risk, trouble or weakness. I did n't realize how much that might have meant to Mr. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> until just now. This is how it ends:

 Though much is taken, much abides; and though We are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are; One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

<TEXT>
 The `` Night Stalker'' jury's deliberations were interrupted Friday by a juror's illness, but the panel planned to resume for a 20th day Monday. The jury, which had to restart deliberations after one panelist's death, began its talks anew on Aug. 16 Eleven of the 12 jurors started discussing the case July 26. Their first 13 days of deliberations were ordered scrapped when a juror died and an alternate was substituted. On Aug. 14, the initial deliberations were interrupted by word that juror <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> was found beaten and shot at her home. Her live-in boyfriend later committed suicide and left a note saying he had killed her in a domestic dispute. The shaken jury was given a day to recover, then started deliberations in the year-old trial over again. Defense attorneys asked the judge to question them about their emotional reactions to the murder, but <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON> refused. Defense lawyers said jurors might be prejudiced by the fact that Ms. <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>'s murder was similar to some of the crimes with which <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> is charged. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, a 29-year-old drifter from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is accused of a series of gruesome murders and assaults that terrified <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in the summer of 1985. The prosecution claims <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> is the devil-worshiping `` Night Stalker'' who left symbols of demon worship at some murder scenes and gouged out one victim's eyes. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>' defense team argued during his trial that witnesses were too traumatized to make positive identifications of their assailant. They claimed that <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> was a victim of mistaken identity.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> registered on Friday its continuing concern that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> may be developing nuclear weapons, but said it was unaware of any development that would heighten the concern. Earlier, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> quoted a department official as saying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was `` gravely concerned'' and was keeping a close watch on possible efforts to develop nuclear weapons. The news agency quoted <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, the head of the department's <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> section, as saying the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would be as concerned if <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> produced such weapons. While denying it has nuclear weapons, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has repeatedly charged that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> were equipped with nuclear arms and were preparing for a nuclear war on the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have rejected the North Korean claims. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> garrisons about 43,000 troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a defense pact. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is the communist <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s main arms supplier. Asked about the <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> report, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said: `` I do n't have anything new to express our concern.'' He added: `` I think we've talked very often in our past about the need for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to put its nuclear programs under international safeguards. They reached some sort of agreement way back in 1985 with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> that they would do that. But so far, the actual safeguards provisions have not been completed and we really think they should do that at a very early date.'' Asked if there was some new reason for special concern, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official replied he did not have any new information about the program `` or something that would lead me to think that our concerns are heightened. But we do have a longstanding concern.''

 An all-out war against screwworms has been launched in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> to help prevent the livestock pests from migrating to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said about 20 screwworm larvae were found Sept. 5 near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> on a horse that had been shipped from <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. Beginning Friday, he said, about 800,000 sexually sterilized screwworm flies will be released twice a week for six weeks in a five-mile radius around the airport and the quarantine station. The technique floods the suspected area with sterile male flies. If a female mates with one, her eggs will not hatch, thus ending the life cycle. Normally, the eggs are laid in open sores or wounds of warm-blooded animals, hatching out into worms that feed on the living flesh. <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON> said the adult screwworm fly is about twice the size of a house fly, with orange eyes and a bluish-green body with three dark stripes along the back. Screwworm larvae are creamy white and grow to about half an inch in length after five to seven days of feeding. Screwworms were eradicated in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> in 1975. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was declared free of the pests in 1966, although small infestations have occurred since then, mostly along the U.S.-Mexico border.

 A toddler missing from his home overnight was found more than 17 hours later Friday clinging to a root in a creek. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitu </PERSON>, who will be 2 on Monday, does n't know many words, but when rescuer <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> found him, the boy reached out and said one word: `` Home.''

 Soviet <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s parliament met in emergency session early Saturday to discuss the ethnic conflict engulfing the Armenian enclave of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, official reports said. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the southern republic's Supreme Soviet would also examine a draft law proclaiming <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s sovereignty and citizenship and transition to the principles of economic independence and self-management. The measures under study in the mostly Moslem republic are in line with demands increasingly voiced by many Soviet ethnic groups for greater control over their own affairs. The meeting convened Friday, but the lawmakers had debated for more than 14 hours as the session extended into early Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials will meet Tuesday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to consider proposed changes in the country's nationalities policy and try to find a way to calm ethnic quarrels that have often erupted in violence. In another sign of the greater democratization under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, it was the first time representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijan </ORGANIZATION> and other informal organizations were allowed to attend the republic's parliament, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It was meeting in the Azerbaijani capital of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> coast. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a mountainous territory within <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> with a predominantly Armenian population, is the center of a dispute between <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. About 100 people have died in ethnic strife the past 18 months, and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> is demanding <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s parliament reassert control over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and that the direct rule over the region by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> instituted in February be halted. `` The situation in and around <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> has never been so tense and explosive as today,'' <PERSON> Arkady </PERSON> <PERSON> Volsky </PERSON>, head of the special committee created by the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to administer the district, said in televised remarks Thursday night. <PERSON> Volsky </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was forced to assume control of the region because of the bloodshed. `` The state can not stand aside if blood is spilled,'' he said. The duty editor who answered the telephone at <LOCATION> Azerinform </LOCATION>, the republic's official news agency, said the session was continuing early Saturday. `` They're still debating and have n't taken any votes,'' said the editor, who declined to give his name. On Thursday, the newspaper Pravda reported that a strike by <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> railroad workers to press demands for Azerbaijani control of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> has resulted in the cutting of fuel and other supplies into neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The strike was called off Monday, but it resulted in severe shortages of fuel and other supplies. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> gets 87 percent of its freight from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said the situation was particularly threatening in northern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, where workers are trying to reconstruct cities devastated by the earthquake Dec. 7 that killed 25,000 people.

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs said Friday he wants the <ORGANIZATION> Seminole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to settle a $ 50 million dispute themselves instead of asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to handle it. `` In most cases, decisions made in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for Indians are the worst solutions,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>. `` Decisions should be made in Indian country.'' His comments came during a hearing on legislation that would divide money awarded the tribe in 1976 for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lands taken when most of the tribe was relocated by the government to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> in the 1823 `` Trail of Tears.'' The award _ $ 16 million _ has been held by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for 23 years because the members of the tribe, many of whom still live in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, have not agreed on how it should be divided. It has accumulated substantial interest, and it is estimated to reach $ 50 million by the end of this year. Legislation sponsored by <PERSON> Oklahoma </PERSON> <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, a Democrat, and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON>, Republican, would give 75 percent of the money to the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seminoles </LOCATION> and 25 percent to the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminoles </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Miccosukee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tribe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the unaffiliated Seminole Indians of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON> said the split is fair because it's based on population figures that counted 2,146 Seminoles in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and 700 in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. He also said the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> tribe is poorer than the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> one. `` Not only did hundreds of Seminoles die during the forced march from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Territory </ORGANIZATION>, but lands initially given to the tribe as a reservation were later taken from them as <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> became a state,'' said <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON>. `` Today the Seminole Nation -LRB- in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> -RRB- has a total of only 380 acres of tribally owned land,'' he said. On the other hand, he said, the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> tribe `` is flourishing economically with a reservation land base of approximately 80,000 acres.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Billie </PERSON>, tribal council chairman for the <ORGANIZATION> Seminoles </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> who want a 50-50 split, told the committee he thought the two sides could come to some agreement if they had 30 more days. `` While we in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> have a sharp disagreement with our <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> brethren over the division of the claims commission's award, we have not lost sight of the fact that we are all one people,'' <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> said. `` As a result of recent informal preliminary discussions we have had with some of our <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> brethren, we believe that it still may be possible in a relatively short time ... to have agreement reached by the two groups.'' `` I would prefer negotiations,'' said <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>. He said sovereign nations, as Indian tribes are viewed, should be able to negotiate.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> predicted lives will be saved by legislation he signed Friday to lower <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s blood-alcohol standard for drunken drivers `` We are seeing a reduction in the number of traffic fatalities caused by drunken drivers,'' he told reporters and law enforcement officers gathered in his office for the bill signing. `` On the other hand, we still have a far greater number of such fatalities than we should have in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. This will make it possible for law enforcement to obtain greater numbers of convictions,'' the Republican governor said. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said 2,239 people died last year as a result of drunken drivers on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> highways. The law, effective Jan. 1, lowers the blood-alcohol level at which a person is presumed too drunk to drive from 0.10 percent to 0.08 percent. Current law allows for prosecution when a driver's blood-alcohol level is below 0.10 percent if there is other evidence the driver was too intoxicated to drive safely Convictions are rare, however. The new law still allows for prosecutions at levels below 0.08 percent if other evidence warrants it. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> supports a 0.05 percent level. A variety of factors, including weight, affect the amount of alcohol a person can consume before getting drunk. The average person can consume about three glasses of beer or comparable amounts of other alcoholic beverages in an hour before reaching the 0.08 percent level. Drunken drivers should beware of the lowered standard, <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said. `` This is a very strong signal and message to individuals who do drink and do drive that it is more likely that they will wind up being convicted of drunken driving ...,'' he said.

The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official referred to the step taken last year by <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, who also publicly renounced terrorism. That action met <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for the dialogue opened by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> last December. `` It is time for the Arab governments to stop the anachronistic practice of voting against Israeli credentials,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. The Arabs have consistently failed to oust <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> but the move provides an annual opportunity to condemn the Jewish state before a large audience. Arab delegates also habitually walk out when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s representative speaks to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> denied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace efforts were at a dead end. `` There is potential for movement,'' he said, adding that a timetable for face-to-face negotiations should be set by Palestinians and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ not the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration.

 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel charged Friday that <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials lied under oath about payroll records prepared during the 1981 controllers' strike and in some instances doctored time sheets to cheat the controllers. The committee asked the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to investigate. Faced with shoddy documents to justify the firings before the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for three months created attendance records to bolster their cases, lawmakers concluded. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on investigations and oversight capped a three-year probe that included private hearings and documents subpoenaed from the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Route </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, Ill. The panel said it was willing to send its evidence to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and sent a letter to Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> urging an investigation into possible criminal misconduct. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, declined comment except to say, `` The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has receieved the report and will review it.'' The subcommittee said it was not judging the merits of the 450 firings in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which were among 11,500 nationwide ordered Aug. 5, 1981, by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, two days after members of the <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controllers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> struck. Rather, the subcommittee said it was concerned with the actions of <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials while they were defending the firings in front of the board that considers appeals from dismissed federal employees. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials corrected some attendance records to bring them up to date, but altered others, in some instances recording a controller who was on leave at the time of the strike as being absent without leave, to cheat the controllers, the subcommittee said. The panel's report said the strike produced `` traumatic and confusing times'' at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> center. Supervisors had to handle other jobs, `` and this situation severely affected the condition of the center's attendance records,'' the report said. On Aug. 13, 1981, 10 days after the strike began and a month before the controllers were told formally they had been fired, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, evaluations officer at the center, began to process personnel files in anticipation that appeals would be filed with the appeals board, the subcommittee said. To justify the firings, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials decided to present attendance records showing that the controllers had failed to report to work during the strike. Between Sept. 14 and Oct. 1, these records were sent to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s Great Lakes regional office in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, but officials there found so many clerical errors that employees in <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> had to produce a second set of attendance records, the subcommittee said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials subsequently assured the merit board that the records were the ones that had been used by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>, the chief of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> center and the official who ordered the firings. The subcommittee concluded, however, that the assurance was `` a certification that we now know to be false.'' `` These documents, in many cases, either did not exist at the time of the controller dismissals or were riddled with errors,'' the subcommittee said. `` A plan was instituted whereby records were created where none existed and amended where there were errors.'' The subcommittee said it was not able to determine who had ordered the second set of records. The subcommittee's report also concluded that <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shewfelt </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s regional manager for labor relations at the time, `` knew of the problems of consistency and accuracy in the records that led to the second shipment.'' Shewfelt, who still works for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office, did not return phone messages requesting comment. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is retired and could not be found for comment. <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>, now supervisor of training at the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Route </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said he had not seen the report and declined to comment.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that it had joined a whistleblower's lawsuit charging that <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> defrauded the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> by selling the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> faulty jet fighter equipment. The department said it had taken over the lawsuit filed by <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Aliksanian </PERSON>, who was a program manager for Fairchild until leaving the company in 1987.

 The first major American exhibition of contemporary East German art is most surprising for what it does not include _ `` no grand pictures of tractors and happy peasants,'' according to a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> curator. Instead, the dozen artists whose work was chosen to represent the German Democratic Republic dispel stereotypes of flat socialist art with often harrowing portraits of the horrors of war and political oppression. The nearly 70 paintings and drawings by artists, ages 35 to the mid-80s, were selected by <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> curator <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON>, art critic <PERSON> Dore </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cooper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and modern German art historian and Professor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Selz </PERSON>. `` We hope the whole show undermines expectations,'' said <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON>, who accompanied the others on travels to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to meet artists and their work. `` This is an example of how many of these artists do not show false optimism or a sense that there is an easy road to an ideal state. They are aware of the fraigility of peace, of nightmares, of anxiety.'' The artists whose paintings are shown are not among the legions of refugees departing the country across the Hungarian border to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, he said. `` These are people who have decided to stay and fight and introduce into <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s official culture as much of human life as they can,'' said <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON>, who led a tour of the exhibit Friday, which opens Sept. 16 and runs through Nov. 5. `` One has to acknowledge the honorable role they play. The people who are leaving decided to give up the struggle.'' The paintings range from <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhlig </PERSON>'s expressionist, almost abstract portraits and landscapes to <PERSON> Theodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenhauer </PERSON>'s still lifes and other, more light-hearted and ironic works. The exhibit, half of which is in the Fogg Museum at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the other half at the <ORGANIZATION> Sackler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> across the street, opens with a twist. The first work on view is a four-panel painting that depicts four Soviet soldiers against a vivid red background. `` It's the perfect introductory painting,'' said <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON>. `` It looks propaganda-like.'' But on closer inspection, the soldiers in <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>'s `` Soviet Soldier 1987'' are clearly from different ethnic groups One art critic, said <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON>, suggested the paintings are a meditation on `` individual versus the group'' and hint at the transience of military occupation and the hope for eventual peace. The paintings and drawings that follow `` Soviet Soldier'' smash stereotypes of `` socialist realism'' painting. <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Heisig </PERSON>'s haunting `` Volunteer Soldier'' is among the most powerful in the exhibit. It depicts the horrified face of a soldier, surrounded by a dark, swirling montage of images that <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> termed a `` collage of horrible memories.'' Many of the artists' works invoke feelings of helplessness and anxiety. <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> suggested that the artists have struggled with the stunted political and cultural history of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. While they draw on the rich history of German art, they can not escape the constraints and sense of collective identity confusion in an Eastern bloc country. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Libuda </PERSON>'s `` Ceiling Runner'' is Kafkaesque in its portrayal of a man hanging upside down with his feet on the ceiling. But not all the paintings are as dark. One of <PERSON> Sighard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gille </PERSON>'s works, `` Party in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>,'' shows a group of artists engaged in a bit of decadence at a cafe. The painting was considered controversial in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> but was eventually allowed to be shown there and abroad, said <PERSON> Selz </PERSON>, who teaches at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. `` It shows there's much more freedom of artistic expression,'' he said.

 About 10,000 people marched through this capital city Friday in support of talks intended to end a decade-old civil war. President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> promised flexibility in the peace effort. The march coincided with <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Independence Day and participants chanted slogans calling for `` True independence, without <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> intervention!'' Many of the left-leaning groups that participated consider <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> dependent on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and subordinate to it. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has provided more than $ 3.5 billion in military and economic aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> this decade, making this couuntry <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s biggest single recipient of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> assistance. The aid has been aimed at preventing a victory by the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, popularly known by its Spanish initials _ <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on Friday celebrated together the 168th anniversary of independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1821. Government and rebel representatives agreed on Friday to open peace talks next month after two days of discussions in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the first such discussions in two years. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> called the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> agreements `` important accords'' on how to proceed toward ending a war that has claimed more than 70,000 lives. But he warned: `` While welcoming the dialogue process, we do n't want to create false expectations. ... We want to reiterate that our attitude is one of openness and flexibility within our constitutional framework ... We know the road ahead is difficult and complex.'' He addressed a small rally of supporters and government officials in a downtown park. For the first time since the war started in 1979, authorities staged an Independence Day military parade though the capital. About 3,000 troops from the three military branches and the three militarized police forces marched to music by military bands. Crowds lined the parade route, which followed a route different from that of the peace march. But the peace marchers appeared to attract more people, who waved white flags and blue-and-white national banners and chanted slogans hailing the upcoming dialogue. The march was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Debate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella organization comprising about 70 church, union, student and humanitarian organizations.

<TEXT>
 Officials in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s two largest parties said Friday that disagreements over <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s plan to arrange Israeli-Palestinian talks threatened the coalition government. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s top leaders on Friday reportedly clashed for the second time this week over the 10-point plan and on President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s efforts to sponsor a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation for talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> emerged optimistic after Friday's session, telling <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio: `` There are some chances for moving our peace process, not only by these 10 points ... There are other developments that encourage us. I do n't think we are facing a deadlock. There is a movement and we are discussing further developments with our <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> friends, Egyptian friends, and I hope that we will get results.'' Egyptian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassiouny </PERSON> presented the plan to the Israeli officials, said an aide to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had been saying it can not comment on a proposal it has not been officially presented with. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, troops shot and killed two Palestinian youths in clashes with stone-throwers in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmed both deaths but said soldiers did not open fire where 12-year-old <PERSON> Tarkek </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuffah </PERSON> was killed. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said <PERSON> Tuffah </PERSON> was shot by an army sniper. The two deaths raise to 570 the Palestinian death toll in the 21-month-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. Forty Israelis have also died in the violence, and 114 Arabs have been killed by fellow Palestinians who accused them of collaborating with Israeli authorities. A meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> ended in sharp disagreement, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s plan stipulates acceptance of the U.S-supported formula of trading territory for peace and participation of the 140,000 residents of annexed east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in the Palestinian elections offered by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Both ideas are opposed by <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> but supported by Labor. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> also proposed that the 12-member Palestinian delegation include two Arabs deported from the occupied territories. The proposal is intended to satisfy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s demand to talk only to Palestinians from the territories and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s insistence that Palestinians living abroad be included in any talks. `` Deportees are not exactly outside Palestinians. ... I would not be quick to reject this possibility,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said in an interview with the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. A Labor official speaking on condition of anonymity said <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> ministers agreed in a meeting Thursday night to negotiate with such a delegation. He said the party saw `` no need to stay in the government'' if there was no progress in peace talks. Labor apparently agrees to negotiate with deportees as a way of bypassing direct negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> officials see no difference. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> officially refuses to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, calling it a terrorist organization bent on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s destruction. Transport Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzav </PERSON>, of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, told the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> that anyone seeking `` to accept the 10 points wants to break up the national unity government,'' which was formed in lengthy negotiations following November 1988 elections. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> wants to resolve the deadlock prior to <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>' and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' visits to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> next week <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> is scheduled to meet with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> during his 10-day stay, and <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> plans to see <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>.

 Fans of mambo king <PERSON> Damaso </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Prado </PERSON> on Friday mourned the death of the musician who, in the words of author <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>, `` launched a coup d'etat against all known rhythms.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Prado </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Matanzas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, died Thursday at his home in a <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suburb after a long illness. The 72-year-old musician suffered a cerebral hemorrhage in July. He was remembered Friday for popularizing the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> music known as mambo in the 1940s and 1950s with his musical performances and film appearances. Musicologists consider him a founder of the mambo and its syncopated beat. The mambo dance, which features lots of hip motion, is similar to the cha-cha. But fans know him simply as the `` king of mambo'' and `` seal face,'' a name he earned for the trademark barking sound he made during his songs. In his front-page essay in the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jornada </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>, a Colombian winner of the Nobel literature prize, said, `` Maestro <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Prado </PERSON> leaped out of anonymity overnight.'' He said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Prado </PERSON> had `` discovered how to string together all the sounds of urban life with a saxophone.'' A homage to <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Prado </PERSON> has been running at the <LOCATION> Teatro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanquita </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for the last week, starring people he worked with. Among them have been singer <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> and dancer <PERSON> Yolanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Montes </PERSON>, known as `` Tongolele.'' `` This homage is for him, in the most sorrowful moment, but he should feel happy because the whole world loved him. We will keep listening and dancing to his music,'' <PERSON> Tongolele </PERSON> said after his death was announced Thursday night. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Prado </PERSON> studied classical music as a youth. However, he moved to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> after World War II and achieved world fame with the mambo's sexy sound. By 1947, he was already well-known in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where he joined an orchestra called the `` Beach Casino.'' He eventually acted in dozens of movies. The Italian film director <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Fellini </PERSON> helped make him famous in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> when he included the mambo `` Patricia'' in the celebrated film, `` La Dolce Vita.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Prado </PERSON> recorded hundreds of records, including such songs as `` How Fine Is the Mambo,'' `` Mambo No. 8,'' `` <PERSON> Lupita </PERSON>,'' `` Pink Cherry,'' `` The Black Horse,'' `` The Popoff Girl'' and `` <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Christina </PERSON>.'' After World War II, the mambo craze swept <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and other <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities. However, when the fever finally cooled, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Prado </PERSON> tried to change his style. His ardent fans, though, pressured him to keep churning out the same kind of music that made his famous.

 <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brauer </PERSON> is severely retarded and a captive of physical problems that require 24-hour attention. His parents ca n't care for him and now the state says it has no money to look after him once he turns 22 next month So <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brauer </PERSON> was set to go to court on Monday in a bid to save his life. `` His life is in jeopardy. There's no question about it because -LRB- state officials -RRB- have n't fulfilled what they have committed themselves to,'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON>'s father, Dr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Brauer </PERSON>, said Friday. `` I do n't know why this is happening to my son, who has done nothing to anybody, whose life is hard to imagine,'' said <PERSON> Brauer </PERSON>, a hematologist at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. `` I'm not asking for charity. ... I'm a pretty resourceful guy. I'm usually able to solve my own problems. But I've really hit the wall here.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Helle </PERSON> <PERSON> Brauer </PERSON>, a physical therapist, have joined nine other couples in suing Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for impounding the money that would continue care for their retarded and disabled sons and daughters. The young people receive care at the private <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Springs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Assonet </LOCATION>, at an annual cost of about $ 80,000 a person. But funding for such care ends when they all turn 22 this year. The lawsuit contends that by impounding the money already approved by legislators, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> violated the constitutional separation of powers, and that retarded citizens such as <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brauer </PERSON> have a constitutional right to treatment and safety. Every year about 450 mentally retarded <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> residents turn 22, the age at which they leave the protection and training of the state education system. The most severely retarded and disabled, about 70 this year, usually get placed in a home in a residential community with 24-hour supervision and medical care. But this year there is no money to pay for such care. The deep budget cuts <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made in July eliminated $ 3.3 million needed to give those 70 people the care they need to survive, said <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retardation </ORGANIZATION>. `` Going home to their families is going to be a real disaster,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` It's a lousy situation.'' The state is trying to help, Ms. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. Parents are being advised about support services. Some could go to state schools for the retarded, reversing a move to empty institutions once decried as warehouses. Pediatric nursing homes that might consider taking adults are also being contacted, she said. `` The choice we have to make is -LRB- for -RRB- someone who is literally homeless,'' she said. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brauer </PERSON> has been at <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Springs </ORGANIZATION> since he was 11. He functions at the level of a 16-month old, is paralyzed on the left side and suffers from grand mal seizures so intense that they can stop his breathing and require him to wear a helmet to avoid injury. He needs help going to the bathroom, dressing and eating. If his parents took him home, one would have to quit work and they could expect to spend some nights just listening to make sure he was still breathing. `` Historically, even going back to the 19th century, this state has always provided for these types of clients,'' said <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLeish </PERSON>, the attorney for the Brauers and the other parents. `` The parents ca n't safely handle these kids. And the schools ca n't continue to care for these kids free of charge. We face the very real prospect of people who are seriously mentally retarded, living in shelters for the homeless. The state has never abandoned people like this,'' <PERSON> MacLeish </PERSON> said. The matter is far from over. Since the lawsuit was filed, some families have been told their children could receive state benefits until new, federally funded cottages are built to accommodate them at <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Brauer </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Irish and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials agreed at a 7 -LCB- - hour meeting Friday that integrity was `` critically important'' among <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> security forces, tainted by charges of murder and collusion with terrorists Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, in his first meeting with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s new <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> secretary, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON>, stressed <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s unhappiness with reports that confidential police documents fell into the hands of <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> gunmen. The officials met specifically to discuss questions about the reliability of the security forces., the first time since the signing of the Anglo-Irish accord in 1985 that security was the only topic on the agenda The pact gave the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> a say in the affairs of the Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province and set up a structure for such meetings as Friday's. <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> said later, `` The Irish put to us their concerns and it was decided all the points raised should be looked at again. In any discussions there are bound to be differences, but ... I think we made considerable progress.'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> called it `` a serious meeting.'' `` The important thing is to establish confidence in the security forces as a whole among the nationalist community in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>,'' he said. The two sides agreed to meet again shortly, a joint statement said. It said both sides `` emphasized their belief that confidence in the evenhandedness and integrity of the security forces was critically important.'' Also on the agenda were the role of the British army's locally recruited <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> and the use of plastic bullets. Irish authorities have said that intelligence developed by the <PERSON> Garda </PERSON> <PERSON> Siochana </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s police force, may not be safe in the hands of the security forces in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the police force in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, disclosed Thursday that a list and photographs of 12 suspected members of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> were stolen from a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> police station. Confidential information earlier disappeared from the <LOCATION> Ballykinlar </LOCATION> army base in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Down </LOCATION>. An English detective was assigned to investigate the two cases. On Monday, two members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> were charged with the murder of a Roman Catholic man. Men who had identified themselves as members of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION> had shown a TV reporter documents, apparently stolen or leaked from security forces, which identified the murder victim as a suspected <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> member.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Panel Hears Police Brutality Complaints</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> police forces have resorted to painful holds, and sometimes brutality, when arresting non-violent demonstrators, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> was told Friday. Most of the complaints related to police actions at `` Operation Rescue'' demonstrations by pro-life activists at abortion clinics. But others suggested a resurgence in some cities of police brutality against blacks. The commission staff cited recurring cases of alleged police misconduct in recent demonstrations in 17 cities, including <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. Virtually none of the complaints asserted wrongful arrest. Rather, they revolved around whether police had used unnecessary force in removing non-violent protesters, some of whom invited arrest as a symbolic gesture. The purported victims were not publicly identified. The `` pain-compliance'' controversy involves a variety of holds that many officers reserve for someone actively resisting arrest. The holds include `` locks'' and `` twists'' of elbows, wrists, or fingers; the twisting of ears or squeezing of mastoid pressure points -LRB- behind the ears -RRB-; or the insertion of fingers into someone's nostrils to pull him off the ground The commission viewed videotapes showing such techniques being used against demonstrators who had gone limp as police tried to move them to vans or buses after their arrest. In the severest case, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police used nunchukus, an oriental martial-arts weapon _ sort of a hinged billy club _ against <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> demonstrators. One man's arm was broken; the snap of his bone could be heard on the tape. `` A fundamental issue is whether pain-compliance techniques, particularly the use of nunchukus, can ever be justified in the context of arresting non-resisting, passive demonstrators,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, the commission's assistant general counsel. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCue </PERSON>, chief of the 125-officer <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, police force, insisted some pain-compliance methods _ he called them `` come-along'' holds _ are appropriate when handling arrestees who decline to move under their own power. <PERSON> McCue </PERSON> said his officers had used such holds when removing Operation Rescue demonstrators from an abortion clinic April 1, when 61 people were arrested, and June 17, when 261 were charged. A demonstrator who goes limp is effectively resisting arrest, <PERSON> McCue </PERSON> said. `` We explain to the arrestee that we intend to use a come-along hold that will cause pressure and probable pain if there is resistance,'' he said. `` If he still refuses, a come-along hold is used, using only as much pressure as required to accomplish the task.'' <PERSON> McCue </PERSON> also offered no apology in response to complaints that his officers had removed their name tags, making it difficult for the demonstrators to bring a misconduct charge against them. `` It is the policy of our department that all officers who will be required to physically move arrestees will remove their badges, name tags, and any other items ... to lessen the possibility of these items causing injury to those arrested,'' he said. `` It's just common sense to remove anything with a sharp edge.'' <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> High </PERSON>, assistant chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, said his officers are instructed never to use pain-compliance holds against non-violent demonstrators and always to wear name tags. The commission, headed by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, also viewed videotapes of helmeted police charging groups of <PERSON> black </PERSON> college students in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, over the Labor Day weekend after some instances of looting by the holiday crowd. It also heard from <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a former police sergeant who, while engaged in a `` sting'' operation against alleged racism within the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, police department, was filmed by an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> crew as two local officers pushed his head through a plate glass window. `` These incidents are frequent,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who is black. `` The evidence of police misconduct is overwhelming; the response to it limited.'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> criminology professor and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, suggested police misconduct may be on the rise as a consequence of political pressures to hire more officers to handle the wave of drug crimes. `` Almost all these cases involve young officers, under the age of 25,'' he said. The commission, which has no authority to discipline departments or officers, is chartered to review the performance of other federal agencies responsible for enforcing civil rights laws and to recommend new laws to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Entertainer <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he recently kicked his 49-year cigarette habit and is optimistic about the outcome of radiation therapy for throat cancer. `` The prognosis is wonderful. It's just radiation, not cutting, so the voice box wo n't come out. Thank God it's localized in one area,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said Thursday night from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>. The cancer is the latest in a series of health problems for the 63-year-old singer, dancer and actor. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> lost his left eye in a 1954 car accident and underwent reconstructive hip surgery in 1985. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he has been a heavy smoker since he was 14. He gave up cigarettes 10 days ago. `` I'm going cold <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. When the urge strikes, `` I put something else in my mouth. Candy, Life Savers, anything.'' A throat abnormality was detected recently during <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' annual medical examination and was diagnosed as cancer by Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugerman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipsman </PERSON> said Thursday in a statement. <PERSON> Lipsman </PERSON>'s office said Friday that no further details on <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' condition will be released. <PERSON> Sugerman </PERSON> expects <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> to recover completely from the cancer, <PERSON> Lipsman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has been on tour for more than a year with <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON>. He is expected to complete an engagement Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Harrah </ORGANIZATION>'s Tahoe hotel and casino, but he will not appear with <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and Miss <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> at concerts scheduled for October in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, area and <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> will continue the tour, except for one concert,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> publicist for the `` Frank, <ORGANIZATION> Liza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON>'' tour. An Oct. 3 benefit concert in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> was canceled. <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and Miss <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> were unavailable for comment, Ms. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. But she added `` their hearts are with <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON>. They speak frequently together by telephone.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was born to vaudevillians <PERSON> Elvera </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> in 1925. He appeared on stage as a youngster and braved bigotry for decades as he toured the country. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' hit songs include `` I've Got ta Be Me'' in 1969 and `` The Candy Man'' in 1972.

<HEAD>Afghan Troops Welcome Trucks with Garlands, Slaughtered Sheep</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Children clapped, the governor was showered with cloth garlands and a sheep was slaughtered in the middle of the road Friday as the military welcomed about 200 vehicles from a supply convoy that began rolling last month. The anti-Marxist rebels welcomed the convoy in their own way. Two rockets slammed down about 250 feet from where the provincial governor, Gen. <PERSON> Noor </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Haq </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulumi </PERSON>, was talking to reporters as trucks and tanks rumbled past. No injuries were reported. <PERSON> Ulumi </PERSON> said almost 1,000 trucks had snaked their way across almost 780 miles of the barren south before arriving in this southeastern provincial capital this week. In <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, sources from the mujahedeen _ or Islamic holy warriors, the Afghan rebels based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> _ and diplomatic sources said the rebels knocked out 80 vehicles and slowed the convoy's forward progress to a snail's pace. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Ulumi </PERSON> said the convoy lost three trucks in a collision and one tank to a land mine. He said it had not suffered any mujahedeen attacks after leaving <PERSON> Grishik </PERSON>, 60 miles west of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>. Earlier, government officials said rebel forces attacked the convoy at least three times and rebel rocket attacks forced it to halt between <LOCATION> Grishik </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>. Initial government reports also said 1,300 vehicles were in the convoy. The rockets Friday scattered the welcoming crowd that had been throwing cloth flowers threaded onto metal rings. The throat of the lone sacrificial sheep was cut with a dull knife in front of the lead vehicle, and tires left gory imprints on the road. The trucks rumbling through the outskirts of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> Friday were the second batch to reach the city. <PERSON> Ulumi </PERSON> said with more expected each day. He said the convoy was carrying ammunition and food and included 500 military trucks, 300 civilian trucks and a brigade of armored vehicles. He would not say how many. There were no civilian trucks and no food in the carefully orchestrated welcoming ceremony. The military trucks were flanked by 32 tanks. Most were stacked with ammunition boxes and caked with dirt. Some were empty with spanking clean cabs. <PERSON> Ulumi </PERSON> said they were unloaded earlier at a nearby garrison. Many trucks seemed new. Government officials have said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> recently delivered more than 1,000 trucks to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ulumi </PERSON> said the ammunition should last troops in the area a year, depending on the extent of fighting. `` If there is no war, the supplies will last 10 years, if there is a war, one year,'' he said. It is the first such convoy since February, when Soviet troops withdrew from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> nine years after intervening to prop up the Marxist government. The U.S.-backed mujahedeen are still fighting the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. The mujahedeen have not captured a major city despite repeated attempts. The convoy was seen as a warning to the mujahedeen that their acknowledged primacy in rural areas could be weakened. Officials in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> were always upbeat about the trucks' progress, but repeated claims that the convoy was on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> were constantly revised. Ulumi would not say when the trucks had pulled out of <LOCATION> Torghundi </LOCATION>, on the northern border with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Government sources in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> have said the departure date was Aug. 18. <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> lies 350 miles to the northwest of <LOCATION> Torghundi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ulumi </PERSON> claimed progress toward <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> was slow because the trucks were used to supply a new set of border posts near <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Speaking through an interpreter, he said the posts should make it harder for the mujahedeen to use clansdestine routes through the <LOCATION> Registan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> to get into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Supplies muust be brought into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> during the summer because winter rain and snow make the roads impassable. Guerrillas have tried since October 1987 to capture <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> and heavy fighting has left much of the city in ruins. <PERSON> Ulumi </PERSON> said two weeks ago that 70 percent of the buildings in the city were completely destroyed. <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> is 70 miles from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and about 270 miles south of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital. It was <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s second largest city with about 300,000 people before the civil war began nearly 11 years ago. Govertment officials said the population fell to about 25,000 when bombardment was at its heaviest, but later talked of 200,000 now living in <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> got hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses even while hundreds of workers were being laid off from his television ministry before the Christmas holidays, witnesses testified Friday. `` I called my children together and said, ` I'm sorry to tell you this, but we wo n't have Christmas until after because the check wo n't be here,''' <PERSON> Joanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ames </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> payroll clerk and single mother of two, testified in <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s fraud and conspiracy trial. She was laid off in November 1985 with 285 other <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> employees, saving the ministry $ 3.6 million, said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Easley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s personnel director for 1 -LCB- years. The prosecution has said that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> received a $ 200,000 bonus on Nov. 12, 1985, and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> got a $ 100,000 bonus. Less than a year later, on Nov. 3, 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board approved a $ 500,000 bonus for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. The Rev. <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who joined the board of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in November 1985, testified that the largest bonus she remembered approving was $ 150,000 plus taxes. But when asked by prosecutor <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> if she would have approved a $ 500,000 bonus for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said: `` If everybody else agreed with it, I would have.'' She said she trusted <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to inform board members of the ministry's financial condition. `` I just trusted him, period,'' she said. She said she was never informed about the extent of an <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> investigation and church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s threat of a civil lawsuit over her sexual encounter with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> She said she learned of the lawsuit threat in March 1987 when <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned from the ministry over the scandal. Prosecutors accuse <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> of diverting millions of dollars in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money to fund his lavish lifestyle. If found guilty of the 24 counts against him, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than $ 5 million. In later testimony Friday, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> lawyer said <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> officials were eager to reach a settlement with Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and wanted to keep the matter quiet. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Furstman </PERSON>, who said he was contacted by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president, testified that Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s complaint sought $ 12 million. <PERSON> Furstman </PERSON> said he saw many problems with the complaint, but `` Rev. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> indicated he still had a strong desire to settle. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> was very concerned that the matter did not become public.'' A deal finally struck between <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> included a $ 115,000 payment to Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, with $ 150,000 in a trust account for her. The trust was never set up, but the money was deposited in a money market account. The trust fund money eventually was returned to the trustee in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy proceedings in July 1988. Former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board member <PERSON> Aimee </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> never told the board about the $ 265,000 paid to Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> in exchange for her silence. Mrs. <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON>, a minister at the <ORGANIZATION> Crossroads </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tabernacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, recalled being asked by <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> to assist him in paying Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> a total of $ 14,000 in 1984. Mrs. <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> called her into his office and spelled out the details of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s sexual liaison. She said she later handed over $ 2,000 to Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> on one occasion and $ 12,000 on a later date.

 Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> insisted to his cabinet on Friday that he will never be indicted in the federal investigation of convicted drug dealer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, according three top District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> opened and closed the monthly cabinet session by telling his aides that they should go ahead with the work of the city without worrying about whether his legal difficulties will worsen, the officials said. `` It was a call to arms,'' said one official. `` He lashed out at the media, said the white power structure is out to get him, and he vowed not to be beaten down by these forces.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has said he will seek a fourth, four-year term next year. Another top city official who attended the hour-long session said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> stressed that he would not be indicted in a probe of his ties to convicted drug dealer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> `` assured us that he was in no legal trouble, that this would all blow over,'' the second official said. `` He also mentioned several biblical passages, and said he was counting on God to see him through this.'' Two officials said the meeting was dominated by <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s comments on his legal difficulties, despite the fact that other issues like drugs, crime and public education were discussed. `` The mayor set the tone,'' a third official said. `` He concentrated on this in his opening remarks, and then he closed by trying to let us know that everything was alright and that we should go ahead with our jobs.'' All of the officials asked not to be identified. `` Cabinet meetings are for the benefit of the mayor and his aides,'' said <PERSON> Maudine </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s chief of staff. `` They are not for the public, and it is disloyal and inappropriate for anyone to talk about those meetings.'' She refused to comment on <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s remarks. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lurma </PERSON> <PERSON> Rackley </PERSON> said Friday the mayor `` wants to go on record as saying he never said that. He never used the words black and white in that context.'' <PERSON> Rackley </PERSON> said she was at the meeting. <PERSON> Rackley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> had no comment on other events at the meeting. The cabinet meeting came just one day after a legal secretary from the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dixie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedrington </PERSON>, testified before a federal grand jury investigating <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s ties to <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a former city employee who faces drug charges in the nation's capital and is awaiting sentencing in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> has reported <PERSON> Hedrington </PERSON> told authorities she saw cocaine in <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> hotel room when the mayor visited there in March 1988.

 Five men arrested with Venezuelan papers and an arsenal of weapons have been linked to Colombian suspects in a drug-trafficking case, authorities in this Canadian province said Friday. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said two of those arrested are known to be Colombian. The arrests Wednesday launched a flurry of speculation that the suspects came to this eastern province to interfere with a hearing Thursday for two Colombians suspected of cocaine trafficking. Canadian Mounted police confirmed that connection Friday. Asked if there was a link between the two cases, Inspector <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fredericton </LOCATION> said, `` That's correct. `` We've re-evaluated the situation between the two groups,'' he said without elaborating. However, <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> said the connection between the cases has prompted police to move the men facing drug charges from <LOCATION> Fredericton </LOCATION> city jail to a more secure prison within the province. He would not say which prison. Canadian police said they had ruled out suggestions that the suspects are hitmen sent by drug traffickers in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to kill officials from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` There's no threat to any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or Canadian government official,'' <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> said in a brief statement. Canadian authorities also rejected speculation that the suspects had intended to cross the border to mount an attack at President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vacation home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, Me. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> late Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Vezeris </PERSON> said, `` We are monitoring the situation there, but we do not beleive it has anything to do with threats to individuals in this country. We believe it is a Canadian matter.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> are in the midst of a crackdown on Colombian drug traffickers, who provide most of the cocaine sold in the States. Canadian and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials say Colombian drug cartels have been routing more drugs through the Maritime provinces because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has tightened its borders. On Friday, police led four of the suspects arrested Wednesday into a heavily guarded provincial court in <LOCATION> Edmundston </LOCATION>, where they were charged with a variety of weapons offenses. The fifth man linked to the case was charged in Saint <PERSON> John </PERSON>. Local police said they are also seeking up to three others as suspects in the case. `` Innocent, innocent. Je suis innocent,'' one of the four handcuffed suspects told reporters outside the <LOCATION> Edmundston </LOCATION> courthouse Friday. `` No speak English,'' said another. Authorities have identified the four as <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Euovio </PERSON> <PERSON> Manzano </PERSON>, <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanabria </PERSON>. Court documents did not state their ages or hometowns. All four were being kept in custody for bail hearings set for Tuesday. The hearing for the two Colombians accused of drug-trafficking was held Thursday in the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Fredericton </LOCATION>, 125 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Edmundston </LOCATION>. When Mounted Police and <LOCATION> Edmundston </LOCATION> authorities arrested the four, a search of their vehicles uncovered an Uzi submachine gun, Soviet and Israeli assault rifles and 3,000 rounds of ammunition. Also seized were six automatic pistols, a .22 - caliber pistol, tear gas, a deactivated Japanese grenade and an electric zap gun used to knock people However, no drugs were found. Police said they also found five Venezuelan passports, and that a fifth man was arrested in another provincial city Thursday. The man, identified as 33-year-old <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, was charged Friday in Saint <PERSON> John </PERSON> with possessing two .22 - caliber Authorities said he was expected to be charged later with an immigration offense. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was to remain in custody for a bail hearing Monday. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Amours </PERSON> of the Canandian <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the Venezuelan passports were sent to the Mounted Police forensic lab in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> to check their validity. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shults </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that two of the suspects are `` known to be Colombians.'' The agency sent several agents to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> on Friday to discuss the case with Canadian authorities, <PERSON> Shults </PERSON> said. Canadian authorities said it was not known how or when the suspects entered <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. However, <LOCATION> Edmundston </LOCATION> police said two of the men arrested in their city had passports stamped in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, indicating they entered <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> there. Two of their vehicles had <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> licenses, including one stolen plate, police said. The vehicle carrying most of the weapons had been rented in <LOCATION> Fredericton </LOCATION>, and police said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was arrested while trying to extend the rental agreement. The four men were also carrying maps of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Police said several locations were highlighted on the maps but refused to say what they were. The suspected cocaine traffickers, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Galindo-Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza-Jaramillo </PERSON>, both 36, were arrested in April after police made <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s largest cocaine seizure. They found about 1,100 pounds of the drug inside the nose of an airplane at a makeshift airstrip outside <LOCATION> Fredericton </LOCATION>. At Thursday's hearing, the two were ordered held for trial next month on charges of importing cocaine. Authorities used dozens of rifle-toting officers for heavy security at the hearing because of worries prompted by the arrests.

 The Salvadoran government and leftist rebels agreed Friday to meet monthly to try to negotiate an end to their 10-year-old civil war that has claimed 70,000 lives. Crowds marched through the streets of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> cheering the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> agreements, and right-wing President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said he was encouraged. Leaders of the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said their hope was for peace in 1990. The rebels and the government agreed to meet next in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> capital, on Oct. 16-17 and at 30-day intervals thereafter. They agreed that two representatives from the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> will mediate the talks and that they will also invite the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> to send observers. The <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> government initially opposed church mediation or outside observers. It had also proposed meeting the Front _ known by its Spanish initials <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> _ every two months instead of at 30-day intervals. The pact, reached after two days of intensive talks, also stipulates that neither side can unilaterally withdraw from the negotiations and that each delegation will have authority to reach binding accords. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> hopes there will be a Christmas and New Year in peace in our country and that 1990 will be the year of the war's final end,'' rebel leader <PERSON> Shafick </PERSON> <PERSON> Handal </PERSON> said at a joint news conference after the accord was signed. `` The blood that has been spilled in the longest and most costly conflict on the continent, all this blood that has been spilled, deserves this.'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> called the agreement `` important'' but cautioned, `` while welcoming the dialogue process, we do n't want to create false expectations.'' `` We want to reiterate that our attitude is one of openness and flexibility within our constitutional framework ... We know the road ahead is difficult and complex,'' he told an Independence Day rally in the Salvadoran capital. The <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> accord was announced on Central American Independence Day _ the 168th anniversary of the independence of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1821. `` We will possibly confront obstacles. But we trust in God and in the good will of the two sides, and we will overcome the difficulties,'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Handal </PERSON> and fellow guerrilla commander <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> proposed the talks because of pressure inside and outside their country for peace. They also said they feared the rightist government would become a `` facist dictatorship'' unless checked by the kind of democracy peace could bring. Most of the war's victims have been civilians. Human rights groups and international organizations say many were killed by right-wing death squads linked to the military and <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s party _ links the party denies. The <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> talks were the first in two years between government and rebels; they were also the first meeting between the rebels and <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s administration. The rebels have already laid out their peace proposal. The government is to present its proposal in October. The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> offered to transform itself from a rebel army into a legal political party in exchange for sweeping social and political reforms. The reforms would erode the power of the military and of <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s party, which now holds controls the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The rebels demand that the military be purged of human rights violators and reduced in size; that the date of the 1991 legislative and municipal elections be advanced; and that a new high court be appointed. In return, the rebels say they will become a legitimate political party and run candidates in elections _ something they have refused to do. They dropped demands for power-sharing and for merging the rebel and government armies and couched their plan in language far milder than any previous proposal. The proposal asks the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to end military aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and channel the money instead into <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s economic development. To prevent a rebel victory, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has given about $ 3.5 billion in military and economic aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> this decade _ making it <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s biggest single recipient of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> assistance.

 A car struck a group of children on their way home from school Friday, injuring nine people, five of them critically, and leaving schoolbooks and notebook papers scattered in the street, police said.

Five children were taken to <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where three were listed in critical condition, including one who was reportedly comatose. One child was listed in serious condition and one in fair condition. `` I'm hoping I can get to sleep tonight.

But black Is blue as it stares up at summer's depthless azure, And azure was what we saw beneath At the timeless instant hanging At arc-height. ... How shall we know the astrolabe of joy? Shall gratitude run forward as well as back? Who once would have thought that the heart, Still ravening on the world's provocation and beauty, might, After time long lost In the tangled briars of youth, Have picked today as payday, the payment In life's dime-thin, thumb-worn, two-sided, two-faced coin? -LRB- From `` Being Here, Poetry, 1977-1980,'' published by <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-

Standard Gravure employees met with grief counselors when they returned to the plant Friday morning and several hundred later attended a Mass at the Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Assumption. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday lamented the loss of life in the rampage, but said he still opposes legislation to ban possession of such weapons. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in March banned the import of foreign-made assault rifles into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including the Chinese-made AK-47. Howeer, possession of the weapon is not a federal offense and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has taken no steps toward proposing curbs on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacture of such weapons. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> bought the AK-47 on May 1 at <LOCATION> Tilford </LOCATION>'s Gun Sales in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, said Police Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>. Gun shop owner <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilford </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> answered all eight questions properly on a federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> gun purchase form. `` He passed all the tests and obligations for purchasing firearms,'' <PERSON> Tilford </PERSON> said Friday. One of the eight questions asked: `` Have you ever been adjudicated mentally defective or have you ever been committed to a mental institution?'' The form shows <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> answered ` no' to that question. <PERSON> Tilford </PERSON> noted that gun shop owners have no way to check the validity of answers to that question. Lt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON>, police homicide commander, has said that <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> had spent time _ voluntarily _ in mental institutions, including Our Lady of Peace in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. Police would not reveal when he had been hospitalized. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>, 47, was a pressman at the plant from 1971 until the company placed him on permanent disability leave last Feb. 2 because of mental illness, police said. Relatives told police that <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> was a manic depressive who had attempted suicide three times. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON>, agent in charge of the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> office, said federal law prohibits firearms purchases only by people who have been committed to a mental health facility under court order. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> said four other guns were found during a search of <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>'s home, as well as the Feb. 6 issue of Time magazine turned open to a detailed article on similar shootings across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the past two years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, during a interview with out-of-town reporters, was asked about Thursday's rampage. `` It is terrible and the loss of human life is horrible. But I have seen no evidence that a law banning a specific weapon is going to guard against it ...,'' he said. `` If you have somebody who is deranged, and I do n't want to prejudice this poor soul, but if he was deranged, I'm afraid you're going to have incidents like this.'' <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gravure </ORGANIZATION> officials hired 15 counselors to help workers when they returned to the plant Friday morning. `` All of these people can be classified as victims,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahearn </PERSON>, vice president of development for Seven Counties Services. `` We do n't need people holding back their pain. Swallowing it wo n't do them any good. Standard Gravure President <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> said almost 90 percent of the company's 360 employees were counseled in offices that had been cleaned up overnight. Bullet holes in walls and ceilings were the only physical reminders of the tragedy. `` Until it strikes home like it has for us, you do n't realize how traumatic something like this can be,'' <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> said. `` I'm pleased to say that, so far, the counseling has gone very well.'' Pressman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON> said the workers were split up into groups, with some receiving one-on-one counseling. `` You just vented your feelings,'' <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON> said. Outside the three-story building, some workers talked to reporters. `` I'm thinking seriously about looking somewhere else for another job. My nerves are shot,'' said pressman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Pate </PERSON>. `` If I go back in there, I'll be waiting for someone else to do the same thing and I ca n't handle that.'' Forklift operator <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he was going to take a week's vacation. `` I'm not ready to come back because of everything that's happened Things like this could happen again,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` I just do n't feel like I can go in there and work. `` There are a lot of workers who have been traumatized by this. It's a shame that management treats people like dogs. They should treat employees like human beings instead of just a number.'' <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> refused to comment on complaints about working conditions and specifics on improved security measures being implemented at the plant. He said full production would resume Monday. He also would not disclose <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>'s weekly disability pay or whether those payments were about to be stopped by the company, a claim co-workers have made in trying to explain the reasons for <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>'s rampage. Many of the workers joined several of the victims' families at an hourlong Mass conducted by Archbishop <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. They hugged and wiped away tears during the service, which was also attended by Mayor <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON> and other local, state and federal officials. `` All of us gather in deep, profound sorrow. We come together to pray for those who are suffering pain and grief,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said during the service attended by about 300 people. Three of the wounded were in critical condition Friday at <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital-University </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, including one man shot in the chest and leg who was back in surgery Friday afternoon. The bloodshed started in the plant's executive offices on the third floor, moved down to the basement, then up to the first floor. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> reportedly had made threats against the company, which prints newspaper inserts and Sunday newspaper supplements, but <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> said he did not know of any threats. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>'s weapons included the AK-47, two MAC-11 semiautomatic machine pistols, a .38 - caliber handgun, a 9mm automatic pistol and a bayonet, said <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> carried a duffel bag full of ammunition. The two MAC-11s were purchased in February, also at <LOCATION> Tilford </LOCATION>'s. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> was divorced twice in the last 11 years. He and his first wife had two sons, 22 and 26. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> and his second wife, <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON>, were also divorced, but they had been living together since 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> said.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> was remembered Friday as a son of the South who became a citizen of the world, as a brilliant poet, fiction writer, teacher and critic _ and as a nice man. `` He was reticent, ironic, reserved and perfectly charming, and I loved and respected him quite apart from his work,'' said poet <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemerov </PERSON>, who owns a copy of the first edition of <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>'s first book `` He had such vigor and such love of life. He was such wonderful company _ he was the soul of hilarity,'' said novelist <PERSON> Eudora </PERSON> <PERSON> Welty </PERSON>, whose first work was published in the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> when <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> was editor in the 1930s. `` He was a good friend to writers _ constantly generous and giving.'' `` Red'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> died Friday at his summer home in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> after battling cancer for three years. In a literary career that spanned nearly 60 years, he wrote dozens of books and made hundreds of friends. Many were colleagues. <PERSON> Cleanth </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> developed the `` New Criticism'' with <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, concentrating on the text of literature, not the authors' lives. `` He was one of our truly all-around men who made great contributions in all fields. He was a great poet, fine teacher and did something to revolutionize the modes of teaching literature,'' said <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. Others were students. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Axthelm </PERSON>, the writer and TV commentator and a student of <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>'s at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> in the mid-60s, recalled sitting in his office over morning coffee to discuss comic scenes by novelist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON>. `` I treasure the memory,'' he said. `` When people ask me what the best thing about going to <LOCATION> Yale </LOCATION> was, I always say <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>. `` To listen to this man of the South talk about the great southern writer was just an unbelievable privilege. I really did love this man.'' Others were officials of institutions with which he was affiliated. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Billington </PERSON>, Librarian of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>'s `` years at the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as consultant in poetry and more recently as the nation's first poet laureate consultant in poetry, were marked by extraordinary excellence of achievement. ... His legacy promises to be with Americans for generations to come.'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> was `` a wonderfully warm and generous man who is fondly remembered by his former students and colleagues,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON>, chancellor of <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> attended as an undergraduate and where he joined two important literary movements _ the Fugitives and the Agrarians. The Fugitives -LRB- named after a literary magazine -RRB- argued the importance of a Southern literary identity; the Agrarians warned against the dangers of industrialization, and it was in that connection that <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> wrote an essay defending segregation. He came to repudiate that stance. `` This was in 1930. He just felt that was then, this was now,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a professor of English at <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> who had known <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> since the late 1940s. `` I think he is going to be read 100 years from now. ` All the King's Men' is already a classic _ generations have read that book,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. His fellow writers marveled at his versatility and virtuosity. `` He's astounding,'' said poet <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bly </PERSON>. `` It's very seldom that someone can write poetry and fiction and do it well. In fiction, you take nine or ten generations and compress them; in poetry, you take 30 seconds and expand it.'' R.W.B. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> professor who produced an anthology of American literature with <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> and is writing a book about him, called <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> `` the greatest person of letters in the country for several decades.'' `` He was extraordinarily gifted in so many different ways: As a novelist, as a poet, as a literary critic of extraordinary influence, as a cultural historian,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. But most were more interested in praising his character. He was, all agreed, a great storyteller, an ardent father -LRB- his colleague <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> once complained that all <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> talked about in his letters was his children -RRB-, a voracious reader and hard worker, a man of high standards. `` He was n't one of these polite, gentle, post-World War II encouragers of the young,'' said <PERSON> Bly </PERSON>, a younger poet. `` When he saw something that was shoddy, he named it _ whether it was in himself or in others.'' He was born in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and educated in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and was known as a Southern writer, though he lived much of his life elsewhere. `` His work was not confined to any place at all,'' said Miss <PERSON> Welty </PERSON>. He was a Southerner `` in his manners and in his warmth and in his accent,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. But he once told me, ` Well, you know, my community is the world. My friends are all over the world, and my friends are my community.' He was a cosmopolitan, but he had a lot of the South in him.''

 From Tarzan to <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, racism in the movies has created false notions and negative images of African-Americans held by both white and black people, two veteran black actors said Friday. `` The dominant culture puts out so much misinformation in a relentless fashion that you are programmed against yourself,'' said <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, recalling that as a child he rooted for <PERSON> Tarzan </PERSON> to win against the Africans. `` I did not want to be one of the Africans yet I am an African. I would reject myself ... In the land of ooga-booga, I wanted no part of it,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, who has appeared in 25 movies and on television, took part in a seminar with <PERSON> Madge </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> <PERSON> Madge </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, late of television's `` Trapper <PERSON> John </PERSON>.'' In making their remarks during a seminar at the Congressional Black Caucus weekend, the two also urged listeners to write in to producers when they are pleased or displeased; refuse to see films or rent videos that do not have black people in significant roles; and form collectives to act on both ideas. `` I never see a Woody <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> film,'' <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> said about the filmmaker who is acclaimed for filming slices of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> life yet whose few black characters frequently are butlers and maids. `` I feel better when I do n't subscribe to the images that deny my very existence.'' The two agreed that: loving black couples are rarely shown; dashing black men are never the heros; black people are thought to have lips that are too large thus few if any kissing scenes are ever filmed. Also, <PERSON> Tarzan </PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, also was in films that `` speak to the evilness'' of the cultures of people of color and those dark people's `` lack of ableness,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. He added that `` what is born out of misinformation is misperception and what is born of misperception is misunderstanding.'' That has lead to, among other things, black people rejecting their culture by straigtening their hair to be more like white people, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. `` As long as you reject yourself, you will never feel of any consequence,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. And added <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, the world only knows about black people what is exported on film, leading to Japanese prime ministers being able to make disparaging remarks about the intelligence of blacks and Latinos. When she was growing up in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> said, black people in films were always worthless, shiftless bums or gangsters. Fortunately, she said, she and members of her family traveled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` and so we knew better.'' Recently <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> said she was insulted by some black producers who were thinking of casting her. But one of them told her `` he thought I was too polished, too cultured, could I ` get down''' or act in a more stereotypical black manner, <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> said. `` That floored me and made me want to leave the business,'' she said to the overflow crowd in a <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> hearing room on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` That's what I expected from the other side.'' But one of the worst incidents occurred when she went to a producer with a project by and about black people. After presenting all of her arguments for something she thought black people would flock to see, <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> said the producer told her: `` It does n't matter what we put out there. Anything we put out there they'll go see.'' Too true, the two actors said. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, using conservative figures, said that if 20 million blacks saw two movies a month at $ 3 a ticket, that would equal $ 120 million a month and more than $ 1 billion a year. `` So if you think you are inconsequential, stop it,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. A visiting black actor from <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was taken aback by the discussion. `` You've kind of blown me away. We guys thought you were doing so well,'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bovell </PERSON> said to much laughter during the question and answer portion of the program. Afterward, he said black Britons were aware of <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> X </PERSON>, Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and also, as seen through the movies, that life in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was good. `` It was presumed to be the same for blacks,'' <PERSON> Bovell </PERSON> said. `` This has been brilliant for me.''

 As workers who labored to remove the scars of the Exxon Valdez disaster left this port town on Friday, the state announced its own $ 21 million cleanup plan for the winter. Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said the winter program will include cleaning shorelines, researching and developing cleanup technology that can be used next spring, and protecting fish hatcheries and untainted, environmentally sensitive areas. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials have pronounced 1,100 miles of oil-smeared shoreline `` environmentally stable,'' saying their 25-week effort to remove gross contamination from shorelines in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> was a job well done. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s Valdez operations, said that while oil remained in some areas, it was not enough to harm wildlife. `` What you've seen is a coastline almost free of oil,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said at a Valdez news conference. `` You're seeing the steady recovery of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>.'' Officials at <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the primary contractor for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> in the cleanup, defended their work at a news conference on Friday. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION>'s general manager, said the removal of oil from beaches was `` Herculean accomplishment.'' `` That does not mean you can not find oil on the beaches. You can find oil if you look for it,'' <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> was conciliatory toward <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> as he announced the state cleanup. `` I think Exxon has made a good-faith efort to clean up the beaches,'' the governor said. `` I'm not going to fault <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> because they made some mistakes. Frankly, some of the things the state has done were mistakes.'' The state should have known more about dealing with a spill, he said. `` At least we should have known no one else knew how to do it,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. The state work will be funded with an oil tax the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> passed this year, and reimbursment will be sought from <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, the governor said. State officials agreed some shorelines were cleaner because of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts. But they disputed the company's rosey portrayal of an environmental rebound from nearly 11 million gallons of spilled crude. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>, the state's environmental commissioner, toured shorelines on two islands south of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> on Thursday and said he was not pleased with what he saw. `` This beach is not environmentally stable,'' he said as he poked a stick into thickly oiled rocks on <LOCATION> Knight </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The Knight Island shoreline was one of the last treated by cleanup crews. The air still was thick with the pungent smell of a chemical fertilizer recently sprayed on the rocks. The fertilizer is supposed to stimulate microorganisms to break down the oil faster than they would normally. <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>, who had visited the same beach two weeks ago, said the process has shown signs of success. In other spots, however, it appeared the cleanup was rushed to meet <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s self-imposed cleanup deadline, <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> said. The commissioner said the state is asking <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to do more research in the coming months to determine the chemicals' possible side effects and whether the process does much more than remove surface oil. Exxon officials said that while the summer cleanup is over, the company will continue to monitor the spill and respond to major problems. About 300 cleanup workers will remain in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, down from about 10,000 at the height of the effort. The spill on March 24th was the nation's worst _ 10.92 million gallons of crude gushed out when the ship ran aground.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sinbad </PERSON> was a hard-drinking old salt, a legendary sailor promoted for battling German U-boats and court-martialed for being three-sheets-to-the-wind with his snout in the gutter. Mongrel or not, Sinbad the K9 sailor was a lucky charm for crewmates aboard the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>, who faced numerous World War II battles without a single loss of life. On Friday, sailors from almost a dozen states gathered around their comrade's seaside grave to honor him with taps and a headstone, placed atop the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s `` most famous dog'' 38 years after his death. A nine-man color guard stood with flags dipped as a rifle squad sounded a salute while King Reynolds, a <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> veteran from <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, raised the flag over Sinbad's grave. As taps filled the sea air, the men of the <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> bowed their heads and cried. `` He was as much a member of the crew as any one of us,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuerth </PERSON>, a veteran from <LOCATION> Lakehurst </LOCATION> who served with Sinbad. `` He was there for all the battles and he was there for all the drinking. He sailed the Seven Seas.'' Sinbad's human companions got the idea of honoring the daring dog at their first reunion in 1986. They mulled it over and finally finished the memorial this year. <PERSON> Sinbad </PERSON> served aboard the <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> for 77 dog years, from 1937 until he was retired in 1948 to a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> station along the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> shore. <PERSON> Sinbad </PERSON> died when he was 15 years old. <PERSON> Sinbad </PERSON> began his military career as a stowaway, smuggled aboard by a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsman </ORGANIZATION>. The ship's captain planned to dump Sinbad at the first port, but became attached to the dog and allowed him to stay. During his dog days, he had his own bunk and personnel file, where his exploits were documented along with his promotions and demotions. He would appear at roll call with life jacket in mouth, dropping it to bark his reply when his name was yelled, his best friends remembered. But what stands out most about <PERSON> Sinbad </PERSON> was that he lived a dog's life like a true sailor. `` He was found in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> one day, passed out in a gutter,'' said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepich </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a former gun captain aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was totally inebriated. A woman saw his <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> tag and called us and we sent a Jeep out to get him. Then we had to send another Jeep to get the guy who was supposed to pick up Sinbad. `` We figured the two got into a drinking contest.'' Well known in the taverns near the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> yards in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> borough, and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s old <LOCATION> Scollay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sinbad </PERSON> would hop atop the bar stool and woof down a few whiskeys with beer chasers, <PERSON> Stepich </PERSON> said A 1943 Life magazine article condensed in Reader's Digest documents the sailor's dog tales. Universal Pictures made a war-years documentary on the plucky pooch, `` and when we showed it at our reunion, there was n't a dry eye in the place,'' <PERSON> Stepich </PERSON> said. Drinking like a St. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON>, however, did not come without its price to the barrel-chested mutt. <PERSON> Sinbad </PERSON> made Chief Dog, the highest rank the animal could attain in the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, and the crew partied till dawn. But a few drunken binges had him busted back to Dog First-Class. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Liming </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, told the crowd of about 100 people at the ceremonies about serving on the disciplinary board. `` He just stared at me,'' he said. `` I noted no remorse or emotion from <LOCATION> Sinbad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sinbad </PERSON> was a whitehat. His jaunty stride was that of a seasoned sailor.'' When he retired, however, <PERSON> Sinbad </PERSON> went out top dog, mostly for his bravery and for keeping the crew safe. `` The idea was that nothing would happen to anyone while <PERSON> Sinbad </PERSON> was aboard,'' <PERSON> Stepich </PERSON> said. `` We had a few men wounded, but nobody killed. Even today I begin to wonder how that could be.'' Sinbad's closest brush came when the <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> took on six German U-boats. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ship rammed and sunk the last of the enemy vessels, but bobbed powerless in the sea for three days afterward. About 100 men stayed aboard, with Sinbad, as the <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> _ its engine room flooded _ was towed perilously back to port. `` The main thoughts were that you were pretty much closer to God than at any time in your life,'' <PERSON> Stepich </PERSON> said. `` God and Sinbad.''

 <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> won a brief but bitter bidding war for <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday with a $ 1.5 billion buyout offer, topping media magnate <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> by $ 100 million. <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION>, a television and real estate concern, also will assume $ 400 million in junk bond debt, bringing its total acquisition costs to $ 1.9 billion. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, who owns 82 percent of <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, already had sold many of the assets of the old <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> studios. The high price was attributed to <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s 4,000-picture library of movies, including `` Gone With the Wind'' and `` The Wizard of Oz,'' which are alluring assets at a time of great worldwide appetite for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> entertainment. `` We believe the global development of not just television but movies is going to exceed inflation by a wide margin,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> president and chief executive, said another big factor was <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>'s willingness to sell the famous <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> lion logo, which he previously had jealously guarded. `` There are people who will claim we paid too much,'' he said. `` -LRB- But -RRB- it is arguably the second-most recognizable logo in the world behind the Coca-Cola logo. I'd put the value of the logo in some hundreds of millions of dollars.'' <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> had been seeking a buyer for all or part of the company for 18 months. Nearly every big American company with entertainment holdings, as well as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, had expressed interest. <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> announced a deal in April to buy <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> studio and some other assets for $ 600 million. At the time, the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> unit of <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was the final suitor to drop out of the bidding. In a surprise move Wednesday, <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> bid $ 1.4 billion for all of <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>. But negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>'s board and <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> unit broke down late Thursday. By bettering <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s deal for all of <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Skase </PERSON> turned the tables on his fellow Australian. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, whose holdings include the <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> studio, had hosted a cocktail party to introduce <PERSON> Skase </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s elite after the <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> deal was announced in April. When <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> re-entered the picture Wednesday, <PERSON> Skase </PERSON> was in the process of buying for $ 8 million the palatial <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> estate of the late <PERSON> Edie </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, the daughter of the late <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, one of <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>'s founders. A source close to <PERSON> Skase </PERSON>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Skase </PERSON> had been angered by <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s offer, although not surprised by it. Neither <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Skase </PERSON> was available for interviews Friday. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> had asked <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> to bid for the company. `` He thought he had a deal, but then the transaction fell apart,'' he said, declining to comment further. <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> owns an Australian television network and 43 percent of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company that produces TV movies and specials, including the `` Lonesome Dove'' miniseries. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> owns worldwide television broadcast rights and domestic pay-TV rights to the 3,000-picture <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> library, which includes pre-1950s <ORGANIZATION> Warners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> releases. But <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> will get domestic and foreign home video rights to that library, as well as non-U.S. pay-TV rights. The 1,000-movie <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> library includes the `` Rocky,'' `` Pink Panther'' and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> pictures.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Urges Compromise at Meeting with Baltic Leaders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> urged compromise upon the leaders of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> at a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting on economic reform plans and ethnic tensions in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Nationalist movements have sprung up in those three <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> republics and other regions. The official news agency said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders of the three republics on Wednesday that `` what is needed is consolidation, reciprocity, a search for sensible compromises.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> have been pushing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reforms and won approval from the national <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to carry out plans for economic autonomy beginning Jan. 1. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wants economic restructuring, but maintains the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> should play the leading role in those reforms. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the Baltic leaders that the `` main current difficulty is that the long-term goals ... come against striking problems, which reflect the current needs of people.'' It said he told them they had to `` move actively,'' but not forget the three fundamentals `` from which we have no right to deviate.'' He listed these as: solving all problems `` only in the framework of the federation;'' unity of the party _ `` the main guarantor of perestroika and the process of national revival,'' and `` equality of the citizens of all nationalities.'' Soviet officials say <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took part in writing a statement from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in late August warning Baltic residents that separatism would not be in their interests. On Aug. 23, more than 1 million Baltic residents joined hands to protest the 50th anniversary of a Nazi-Soviet agreement in which <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> incorporated the previously independent Baltic states into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiido </PERSON>, an editor of the official Estonian radio, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> that the republic's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Vaino </PERSON> <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruutel </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Indrek </PERSON> <PERSON> Toome </PERSON> attended the meeting. <PERSON> Tiido </PERSON> quoted Estonian leaders as saying <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> expressed a willingness to `` put pressure through the Politburo on ministries in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'' that might try to slow down economic reform. He said that <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON> dodged questions on ethnic tensions in interviews after the meeting. Last month, non-Estonians went on strike to protest a law imposing residency requirements for voting and running for local office in the republic. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said in its account that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the leaders on Wednesday that perestroika _ his term for economic and social restructuring _ `` can succeed only if the party ranks are united.'' `` It would be a grave historic mistake to weaken such a powerful political organism, as the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' Also on Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda accused members of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> Narodni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rukh </ORGANIZATION> political movement of seeking to undermine <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> authority and take power itself in the republic. The Narodni Rukh ended a three-day founding congress last Sunday.

<HEAD>Bill Against Assault Weapons Planned; NRA Says No Chance of Passage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES WOLFE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>

 Prompted by a shooting spree that left eight dead and 13 wounded at a printing plant, a state lawmaker said Friday he would sponsor a bill in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to outlaw assault weapons. `` We owe it to the families and the other victims to try at least to make it harder for a deranged person to obtain the weapon,'' said freshman Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, a Democrat. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said he would file a bill for the legislative session that begins in January, despite a key <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leader's assessment that the measure's chance of passing would be slim. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which helped defeat gun control legislation in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, was unconcerned about the bill, a spokesman for the firearms lobby said. The issue was revived after Thursday's rampage at <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gravure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by a heavily armed employee with a history of mental illness. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> killed seven people with a Chinese-made semiautomatic AK-47 assault rifle, then killed himself with a German-made 9mm pistol. The small arsenal he carted into the plant in a gym bag included two MAC-11 machine pistols, a .38 - caliber revolver and hundreds of rounds of A person bent on such mayhem would not be stopped by an anti-gun bill, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sportsmen </ORGANIZATION>'s representative to the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> `` You just ca n't legislate against a nut,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Stumbo </PERSON>, a `` card-carrying <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> member'' who as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority floor leader helps control the flow of legislation, said <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> would have an uphill fight for his bill. House leaders usually allow any bill to go to the floor for a vote if _ and it's a big if _ it makes it out of committee, said <PERSON> Stumbo </PERSON>, a Democrat. `` I do n't think the chances of that measure would be very good,'' <PERSON> Stumbo </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> once had ordinances requiring a waiting period for handgun buyers, but that changed in the 1984 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> with a bill backed by the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>. The bill, which sailed through both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, prohibited local governments from enacting gun-control measures of any type. But now, `` with this proliferation of high-powered assault weapons, attitudes of the general public are changing. We just have to see that these weapons are different,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> will discredit itself by opposing a ban on assault rifles because assault rifles are not in any way a sporting weapon. There would be nothing left of a squirrel to eat after it had been shot with an AK-47,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> was `` extremely sorry about the terrible thing that happened,'' but that `` nothing has changed'' about the organization's opposition to gun legislation. The tragedy was not due simply to <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>'s possession of automatic or semiautomatic weapons, he said. `` The man could have walked into that place ... with a pump shotgun and done a lot more damage than he did with this so-called assault rifle,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> called for a national ban on assault weapons, saying, `` What do you need these for, except for killing people?'' And Archbishop <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> alluded to gun-control laws at a Mass for the shooting victims. `` We are a democratic society,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` We've got to be able to find ways to keep this from happening again.'' But it will not be prevented with legislation like <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think it will ever happen in our state,'' he said.

 A series of bombings in three of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s major drug-trafficking centers Friday damaged banks and injured seven people, including two policemen, authorities said. The army meanwhile said it arrested 28 suspected leftist guerrillas and accused them of carrying out terrorist acts with drug traffickers around the cocaine hub of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. In the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, a bomb blew out windows and caused extensive damage Friday night to an insurance building, which also housed a savings and loan bank. Two other blasts damaged a state bank and another bank. <ORGANIZATION> Cali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Roso </PERSON> <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>, in an interview with national <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>, said the three bombs went off within a few minutes of each other in the city of 1 million people. He said five people were seriously injured. `` The wave of terrorism has escalated, but we now have things under control,'' he said. The region is home to one of four <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s major drug cartels, which have been blamed for a series of nationwide bombing attacks in recent weeks. In <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, 150 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, police said a bomb went off Friday night at a highway to the capital as a police car drove by. Two policemen were injured, they said. A two-week curfew was suspended Thursday in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said the curfew was lifted because the city of 2 million had returned to `` absolute normalcy.'' Earlier Friday, four bombs exploded at banks in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. Banks have been major targets of bombings since the government launched a crackdown on the drug trade a month ago. No one claimed responsibility for any of Friday's attacks. Also Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> ordered the country's 200,000-member army and the national police on alert and reinforced security at many buildings in anticipation of violence on the eve of the `` Day of Love and Friendship. Colombians exchange gifts on Saturday's holiday. In eastern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Colombians </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Galindo-Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza-Jaramillo </PERSON> were ordered held for trial next month on charges of importing 1,100 pounds of cocaine. They were arrested and the drugs seized in April. Their hearing in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Fredericton </LOCATION> was held Thursday under tight security following the arrests Wednesday in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> of five armed men. Inspector <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fredericton </LOCATION> said Friday the two Canadian cases are linked, but he gave no details. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said two of arrested men are Colombian, although all held Venezuelan passports. The arrests in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> were announced in a communique from the 4th <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, the site of almost daily bombings, shootings and arson attacks since the government and its cocaine cartels declared war on each other last month. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been helping <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in the crackdown, and Gen. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Botero </PERSON> <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s defense minister, said Friday that <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> would be sending `` various airplanes.'' However, he gave no details, and there was no immediate confirmation from Argentine officials. The army said the 28 arrested belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is one of six leftist guerrilla groups operating in this South American country. The communique did not say when the 28 were arrested or what specific `` terrorist acts'' they were accused of committing. `` We have succeeded in capturing an entire gang of bandits from the so-called <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> that together with narco-traffickers have been carrying out terrorist acts -LRB- around <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' it said. It would be unusual for leftist guerrillas to work with drug cartels. Drug organizations here traditionally have considered guerrillas their enemies and have funded hit squads aimed at killing leftist sympathizers. Drug traffickers also view the army-guerrilla confrontations in remote regions as getting in the way of their cocaine processing and shipping operations. Since President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> decreed special emergency powers Aug. 18 to aid in the anti-narcotics fight, authorities have been rounding up drug suspects and seizing bank accounts and property presumed linked to the traffickers. The emergency measures temporarily suspend some constitutional guarantees and allow suspects to be held for eight days without being formally charged. The current crackdown started after drug gangs Aug. 18 assassinated the leading presidential candidate, Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, a foe of the traffickers. Also Friday, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> backed up a declaration made the day before by <PERSON> Botero </PERSON> <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON>, who said there were no American military advisers in the country. `` The problem is the word ` advisers.' They are n't advisers. We have trainers and technicians,'' said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke to foreign reporters on the condition of anonymity. Consternation arose in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> following reports from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had deployed troops to help fight narcotics in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>.

 After being brushed by several hurricanes this year, the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands may get the brunt of Hurricane Hugo as it churns westward with 150 mph winds, forecasters said Friday. `` It looks like this one is not going to miss the islands like the others,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Beven </PERSON>, a forecaster at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>. `` It's on the most southerly course of any this year and that should keep it down in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> longer.'' A hurricane warning was posted Friday from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, and a hurricane watch was issued for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. A tropical storm watch was issued for the islands of <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>. Rough seas have been reported around the islands since Thursday. Forecasters described the force four hurricane as `` extremely dangerous.'' Category five is the scale's highest rank. At 10:30 p.m. EDT, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s center was near 14.9 north latitude and 56.6 west longitude, or about 340 miles east southeast of the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> resort island of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Leeward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The storm was moving west at 15 mph. With nothing in the atmosphere to divert it or sap its power, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> was expected to remain on its westerly course and strengthen somewhat during the next 24 hours, according to reports from an Air Force reconnaissance plane. <PERSON> Beven </PERSON> said the center of the system could reach the <LOCATION> Leeward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> on Saturday night and may move toward <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> over the weekend. Rainfall amounts of five to 10 inches is expected in the path of the hurricane. Three other hurricanes this year _ Dean, <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Gabrielle </LOCATION> _ turned north toward <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> before reaching the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s southern course is reminiscent of Hurricane Gilbert, which pounded <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and the Mexican mainland last September. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> was upgraded Friday to a force 4 storm. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was a 5, the scale's highest rank <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> is the eighth named storm of the present <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Tropical storms have maximum sustained winds of 39 mph, and reach hurricane status when winds reach 74 mph.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> appeared Saturday in public for the first time in more than three months, meeting an American professor at the Great Hall of the People.

Hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of people died as troops shot their way into the city on their way to capture Tiananmen Square from student demonstrators.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Thursday approved the demolition of eight buildings in two housing projects in a compromise that was struck after a proposal to knock down nearly five times as many high-rises drew fire. In addition to demolishing buildings containing about 1,900 apartments, the agreement between the <ORGANIZATION> Newark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> and tenants groups calls for the renovation or construction of more than 3,000 apartments for poor people. Nearly $ 3 million in federal Housing and Urban Development funds are committed to the renovations and construction. The city originally had planned to tear down 3,900 buildings containing about 5,700 units. Tenants and advocates for the homeless said the plan would swell the number of homeless people in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Debevoise </PERSON> tentatively approved the plan on Aug. 17, but delayed final approval until Thursday to give officials time to distribute copies of the pact to tenants and federal housing officials. `` There was some disagreement, but none of the parties involved wanted to jeapordize the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funding in the agreement,'' said the judge, whose courtroom was packed with tenants and many on the authority's long waiting lists. Under the agreement, buildings containing 1,506 apartments in the Columbus Homes project and about 400 at the <ORGANIZATION> Kretchmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> will be demolished. Most of the units in those two projects are already vacant. The pact requires the city to break ground for the 1,776 new units it has promised to build before beginning demolition at <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> and to repair and fill 1,632 vacant apartments before demolition at the other project. Many of those attending Thursday's hearing took the opportunity to complain about the housing authority's efforts to provide low-income housing. About one-third of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>'s 316,000 residents receive public assistance. The housing authority is the eighth largest in the nation with 13,000 apartments. The original plan to destroy most of the city's high-rise projects reflected a trend toward low-rise public housing, which is considered more manageable by many officials.

<HEAD>Retired Colonel Urges Vietnam-era Phoenix Program in War on Drugs
in Colombia</HEAD>

 How to fight <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s drug lords? One suggestion, on <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Reporters'' Saturday: Try something like the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> program of `` selective'' assassinations of <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> leaders that went on during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. That would be a tad controversial. But then, it comes from a controversial soldier _ retired Army Col. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackworth </PERSON>, a highly-decorated combat veteran of the Korean and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> wars. To `` win a war of terrorism, you have to employ terrorism,'' he says. Although the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> program `` certainly did get out of control at times,'' he says on the show, `` it worked very effectively in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' He does n't advocate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in such an effort in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, or say who should set it up. But in fighting the drug battle, he says, `` a program like that, a covert program, is needed to win the war'' against the cocaine barons and their underlings. The key to it, he says, `` is to create that fear ... that they do n't know if they're going to be here tomorrow.'' Strong words from a man who made headlines in 1971 by breaking ranks from his colleagues while still on active duty in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. He did it in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> `` Issues and Answers'' interview in which he sharply criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> training and tactics, and all but declared the war unwinnable. The flamboyant Aussie <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunleavy </PERSON> is both the anchor and chief correspondent of Saturday's `` The Reporters,'' a special called `` Narc War: The Southern Front.'' But <PERSON> Hackworth </PERSON> is there in three unusual roles: as the special's military advisor; as an interviewee; and, on a limited basis, as an interviewer of some of the Colombian army's officers and men who are fighting the drug war This complex, up-from-the-ranks soldier now lives in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, is an advocate of nuclear arms reduction, and on Saturday's show he urges killing the Stealth bomber and Star Wars programs, among other military things, and using the money instead for what he calls `` this real war'' on drugs. His recently-published memoirs, `` About Face,'' are true to his pull-no-punches style. It is likely that eyebrows will be raised that <PERSON> Hackworth </PERSON> is on `` The Reporters'' as both an advocate of ways to fight the drug war and as a sort-of reporter on the battle. It is considered good form in traditional journalism to keep the roles of advocate and reporter separate. That he is on the show is due to <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, executive producer of `` The Reporters.'' He says he knew <PERSON> Hackworth </PERSON> from his own days in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and knew his <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> combat background. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> says he thought that <PERSON> Hackworth </PERSON>'s perspective would would make him the ideal guest expert for a special on the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> military's fight against drug terrorists and producers, a fight that some have likened to the early days of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. `` This was the first time he had done something like this,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> says. `` He was very effective in the role, and so we'd like to use him more'' in future stories about the drug war in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` I'm not sure whether he wants to do that,'' he said. `` The last time I talked to him, he wanted to go off to a farm in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> ... but this might stir him up.'' Stone's show, launched in July last year and often cited as a prime example of tabloid TV, starts its second season on Sept. 30. Ironically, at a time some network news programs have been accused of edging toward the tabloid, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> says his series is moving the other way. He says, `` I've been moving it into a more classical ` 60 Minutes' church. That durable CBS congregation, incidentally, starts its 22nd season on Sunday, with <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> <PERSON> Vieira </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroft </PERSON> now part of the `` 60 Minutes'' flock headed by founder-executive producer <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>. Its leadoff piece, a good one, is <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>'s trip with Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, outgoing chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, during last summer's unprecedented visit by <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> to Soviet military installations. -LRB- In one scene in which <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> interviews a top Soviet general, a little editorial needling of a rival seems afoot. One clearly sees an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> cameraman taping away behind <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>. -RRB- `` 60 Minutes'' chief <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> says he is n't worried that the syndicated rash of so-called `` reality-based'' tabloid series this fall will affect his high-rated broadcast's ratings by surfeiting viewers with too much, er, news. `` I'd like to believe that we're different,'' he adds. Furthermore, he says of tabloid TV shows, `` I do n't watch'em.''

<HEAD>Top Children's Entertainer Back With Environmental Songs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an obscure suburban rehearsal hall, <PERSON> Raffi </PERSON> prepared to return to his pre-school audience after a one-year sabbatical took the children's entertainer away from the grind of concert tours. He and his four-piece band ran through every chord and gesture certain to delight a young crowd, from `` Shake My Sillies Out'' to the nonsense words that turn `` apples and bananas'' into `` ooples and banoonoos.'' <PERSON> Raffi </PERSON> has sold more than 4 million records and created a one-man cottage industry of children's books and videos based on the principle that little kids _ and their parents _ can be treated with respect. He is slowly returning to work. Instead of the usual string of concerts, he has scheduled only six shows in September, four of them in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and two at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Carnegie Hall. Then <PERSON> Raffi </PERSON>, who uses just his first name, plans to spend the fall recording his first album that wo n't be aimed exclusively to an audience five years old or younger. The attempt to broaden his audience allows greater vocabulary and more difficult concepts than in his previous work, but does n't mean he's not happy with his role as a children's entertainer. The sabbatical, he explained en route to his office after the rehearsal finished for the day, was spent mostly at home in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and consisted of `` no concerts, no interviews, and no thinking about a next record.'' `` It took me out of the treadmill, out of the career demands,'' the 41-year-old folksinger said. `` It allowed me to listen to my own inner voice again.'' His trademark beard still intact and dressed in T-shirt and casual pants for the practice session, <PERSON> Raffi </PERSON> said he wanted to take the time to examine what he'd done recently and take stock of where he was. `` For me, I just had to really examine all this touring and the tremendous amount of travel it took,'' he said. In 1987 and 1988, he chalked up 200 sold-out concerts in 70 cities across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. He sorted through fan mail, some of it with words and some solely of scrawls and pictures, as he settled into his comfortable office. Little of this could have been anticipated when he turned to children's entertaining in 1974, just six years after his family emigrated to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. `` I could n't conceive where this would go whatsoever,'' he recalled of his start. `` It was literally not knowing what you were doing.'' He recorded his first album of children's songs, `` Singable Songs for the Very Young,'' in 1976, but did n't stop thinking of himself as a folksinger who happened to do some children's music on the side until two years later. `` It took me that long to discover the true value of the career that opened,'' he said. Now, with eight albums, half a million <PERSON> Raffi </PERSON> books in print and two concert videos out, <PERSON> Raffi </PERSON> has discovered what larger corporations in children's entertainment have long known, that a completely new pre-school audience is ready every few years. That means all his merchandise can perpetually stay in book and record stores. `` I'm an entertainer of children and their families,'' <PERSON> Raffi </PERSON> said. `` It's such a new undertaking. ... There's room for many, especially the ones who are doing it for the right reasons.'' Except for the concert videos that were conceived as being interactive, he has stayed away from television because he believes the medium contradicts children's basic nature to be doers rather than viewers. `` TV is not a natural friend of the young child,'' <PERSON> Raffi </PERSON> said. `` The two videos that I have were a compromise.'' His songs are simple, tuneful, thoughtful and fun. `` Did you ever see a whale with a polka-dot tail?'' he may ask in `` Down by the Bay,'' while in `` One Light, One Sun'' he sings of `` One song heard by everyone. One love, one heart, one heart warming everyone.'' Perhaps his biggest innovation in children's entertainment may be that in gearing his songs to a young audience he did n't forget that they should n't grate on an older one either. Some children's entertainment, he said, seems to have been created on the assumption that a `` saccharine-like quality'' had to be present. `` If you're comfortable in your respect for children as whole people, there's no need to speak to them in a condescending way,'' he said. The entertainer said, for example, that he believes a 3-year-old fan's question of `` <PERSON> Raffi </PERSON>, how did you get out of my tape?'' should be considered a realistic perception. `` I'm just respecting the difference,'' he said. `` Any entertainer has to know his audience; it's just that simple.'' <PERSON> Raffi </PERSON>, who is separated from his wife, has no children but said he draws on what he has learned in performing and his own memories. Plans for the new album are to call it `` Evergreen, Everblue,'' featuring songs with environmental themes. Most were written on sabbatical but three from earlier albums, including `` One Light, One Sun,'' `` Just Like the Sun'' and `` Big Beautiful Planet,'' will be freshly recorded. He said he was deeply affected by the environmental news of the past year. `` It just struck me how prevalent the global mess really was,'' <PERSON> Raffi </PERSON> said. One of the new songs, `` Clean Rain,'' is about acid rain, a topic of consistent concern in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and will say, `` I remember the days when the rain fell clean.'' Another spark for interest in environmental issues came from another one-name pop star, Sting, who stopped in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> on tour to call attention to the devastation of the <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> rain forest. `` That was an interesting meeting,'' <PERSON> Raffi </PERSON> recalled. `` It turned out Sting's kids were fans of mine.''

 People expect great things from <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON>, the producer of `` Cats,'' `` Les Miserables'' and `` The Phantom of the Opera.'' But a musical set in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>? That's something else. `` It's another emotional roller coaster,'' the Tony-winning millionaire said of `` Miss Saigon,'' his most-anticipated blockbuster to date. The $ 4.65 million-show, opening Sin <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> prior to the 1975 fall of <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> and then picks up in 1978. The musical at the Theater Royal, Dept. 20, is set rury <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, reworks the `` Madama Butterfly'' story about the doomed liaison between an American naval officer and his Japanese bride. It stars Welsh actor <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryce </PERSON> as a Vietnamese pimp; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> as the lovesick American GI and his wife; and 18-year-old Filipino actress <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON> in her Western stage debut, as <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, the musical's tragic heroine. `` Miss Saigon'' reteams <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON> with <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Boublil </PERSON> and <PERSON> Claude-Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Schonberg </PERSON>, the award-winning French authors of `` <LOCATION> Les </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miserables </LOCATION>,'' which is well on its way to being the most internationally successful musical ever. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Maltby </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the Tony-winning Broadway director of `` Ai n't Misbehavin''' and `` Song and Dance,'' co-wrote ther over three years and its pre-opening ticket sale of $ 7.75 million is believed to be a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> record <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON> said its appeal differs from that of `` <LOCATION> Les </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miserables </LOCATION>,'' which was based on <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s epic 1862 novel and has been running in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> almost four years. `` ` Miss Saigon' does n't have the revivalist emotion of the end of ` <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Mis </PERSON>,''' he said, referring to the earlier musical's final number. `` They all start singing ` When Tomorrow Comes' ... and there's a terrific surge of powerful emotion about survival.'' <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON> said the new musical, by contrast, presents `` an intimate tragedy about a girl who gives up her life,'' and that he and his collaborators did not intend `` Miss Saigon'' as an overt political broadside. `` It's set against the Vietnam War, but you could equally, though not necessarily as effectively, set the story in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> or wherever colonialism rears its head,'' he said. `` We all militantly eschewed a political statement,'' said <PERSON> Maltby </PERSON>. `` We believe any political statement will emerge from the events on-stage. `` It's hard to miss a parallel between the war itself and what happens to this Vietnamese girl.'' `` Miss Saigon'' is expected to arrive on Broadway late next year, but <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON> said this may well be his last mega-musical for a while. `` I've had more than my share of luck; I really ca n't cope with looking after any more shows,'' said the 43-year-old producer, who will spend 1991 producing the movie of `` <LOCATION> Les </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miserables </LOCATION>,'' to be directed by <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> -LRB- `` Mississippi Burning'' -RRB-. His hit musicals have generated a truly international theater stretching across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, but he said in an interview: `` I'm beginning to lose my enthusiasm for it. `` People say, ` What's your next biggie going to be?' and I think, ` Who cares?' All that matters is that what we do, we do well.''

<HEAD>You May Know More Than You Know About Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumers seem to understand a lot more about inflation than they've been given credit for. Their actions prove it. Unlike the behavior of the 1970s, when the mere mention of the word sent people running to the store to buy things before prices rose _ thus assuring that prices would rise _ today's consumer remains calm. It's a good thing too, because the noise made by inflation alarmists in recent months recalls World War II days, when air raid sirens sent people scurrying to cellars before the bombs fell. Throughout this year the inflation alarmists have screamed warnings every time the government released another monthly report on prices. And they're ready to do it again today, the scheduled release date for August producer prices. Unlike the situation in the 1970s, however, people are n't rushing to buy. They're taking their time instead, forcing automakers into granting discounts. And they're avoiding items on which prices have risen sharply. This avoidance behavior is n't much publicized, but it is very real. People are indeed switching from inflated items to what they consider better buys, and you can demonstrate it from the numbers. There are many measures of inflation, the most popular being the consumer price index. The CPI is based on prices of a `` basket'' of goods and services. Items in that basket were chosen in 1982, based on existing shopping patterns. Another measurement is called the Gross National Product implicit price deflator. It measures not just prices, but changes in spending patterns too. The items in the basket vary in keeping with changes in shopping behavior. Since 1982, the implicit price deflator has averaged 0.4 percent per year less than the fixed basket index. The difference is significant, and it can mean only one thing: Consumers have been avoiding inflated items. Why this should be so is n't as clear as the fact that it is happening. It could be in reaction to the foolishness of the 1970s. It could reflect greater competition and more goods in the marketplace because of imports. Education might be play a role. Instinct, too. Confidence in government? Maybe. One of the likely possibilities is that consumers have been forced into selectivity because workers' earnings have n't been growing explosively, as they did in some periods of the 1970s. Squeeze inflation from the numbers, in fact, and you can see that average hourly earnings are no higher than a decade ago. Whatever the reason, the results are clear. Although shoppers may have little flexibility in deciding what items to buy, they have been exercising choice where they can. Otherwise, the statistical pattern would n't be so clear. This change wo n't silence the alarmists. Unable to break the bad habit, they will still scream their warnings. You might recall that in the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administration they screamed all the way down into the pit of recession. The big difference between now and the 1970s, however, is that their audience is more critical and informed. Consumers are n't being panicked into buying. Instead, they're remaining cool and selective.

Hall, with his wife, <PERSON> Johanna </PERSON>, was the author of Top 10 hits `` Still the One'' and `` Dance With Me'' in the mid - With fellow artists <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, he organized the anti-nuclear <ORGANIZATION> Musicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> benefit concerts in Madison Square Garden 10 years ago. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' band was known more for its antics than its music. The Fugs satirized sex and politics with profane shows. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> authored a best-selling book on <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> and once published a literary magazine with an obscene title. They got into local politics for the same reason: the county's plan to consolidate 15 landfills into a huge trash-burning facility about four miles from <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Saugerties </LOCATION> `` I tend to have all these grandiose plans, wanting to stop nuclear power and things like that,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` It's kind of ironic that a dump and an incinerator would get me involved in this.'' The balding, 41-year-old singer-songwriter wore a `` stop the dump'' T-shirt to a recent interview. Talking at length of the intricate inner workings of local politics, he joked that he and his wife were planning to celebrate their 20th anniversary by crashing a closed <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> caucus. After initially rejecting the town committee's request to run for office, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> changed his mind, figuring it would give him another platform to campaign against the dump. Hall dismisses talk that his pop music background could hinder his political career. `` I suppose some people might think that musicians are frivolous or that artists of any kind are less substantial people than the lawyers and accountants who make up the political mainstream,'' he said. `` I do n't think that's true, and I think my involvement in issues concerning <LOCATION> Saugerties </LOCATION> for the last 10 years shows that.'' Hall is one of six people running for four open seats in his district. <LOCATION> Saugerties </LOCATION> is Republican territory, but <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s name recognition and local anger over the proposed incinerator give him a better than even chance of winning, said Republican leader <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON>. It also does n't hurt when an old friend such as <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Raitt </PERSON> comes in for a fund-raising concert. Hall now has nearly $ 20,000 for himself and other Democratic candidates. `` What can I do?'' quipped <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> about having to counter appearances by famous rock stars. `` I can play the radio.'' <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' background has attracted more attention. One of the <ORGANIZATION> Fugs </ORGANIZATION>' better-known antics was unsuccessfully trying to enter <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to masturbate in front of invading Soviet tanks, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Encyclopedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Roll. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Roefs </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' opponent, has run radio advertisements noting that he was fighting in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> at the same time <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> was demonstrating against the war and being arrested for distributing obscene literature. The charges were later dropped. At a time in which Judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nomination was scuttled because of past marijuana experimentation, a politician's history is fair game, <PERSON> Roefs </PERSON> said. `` A person's background usually predicts his views for his entire life,'' <PERSON> Roefs </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't believe that we have people in this society that constantly change and become good guys and bad guys overnight.'' <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said he's 50 years old now and mainstream enough to get federal grants for poetry during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. He said he's always voted as a Democrat. `` I've always been an American,'' <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said. `` I'm proud of it. It's just that I could not support the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' Some of his satirical work would be considered tame today, he said. `` Go listen to <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Dangerfield </PERSON>, go to a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> concert,'' <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said. `` What I did in my wild youth is nothing compared to what you can hear at a Catskills resort.'' <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> won an early test in September by finishing first in a three-way Democratic primary. His task in the general election is generally considered tougher, even though his district includes the artsy enclave of <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>. Both <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> are trying to crack a 33-member Legislature that has 28 Republicans. Hall still performs music, but he has no record contract. He and his wife concentrate on writing songs for country artists such as <LOCATION> Juice </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, the Oak Ridge Boys and others. He still earns about $ 20,000 a year in royalties for each of his two hit songs and is constantly considering offers to use the songs in commercial endorsements. That makes it easier to swallow the $ 8,000 annual salary of an Ulster County legislator. `` My main job for the last year and a half has been community organizing,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` I've spent many more hours working on zoning and illegal junkyards than I have writing and performing.'' As for political ambitions beyond the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` It's really too early to speculate about that. First I've got to get elected and stop the dump.

 Moments after <PERSON> Marcella </PERSON> <PERSON> Gautier </PERSON> opens for business each morning, her regular customers begin arriving for their daily fix. The customers, blue-collar workers for the most part, quickly purchase a small amount of the fine, white powder they have come for. Many of them ingest it on the spot. `` They tell me they need some of my powder to get them going in the morning,'' she says. If it sounds as if something illegal's going on here, no one in Midway would be misled. Midway, you see, is midway between <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, two of the region's remaining three headache powder producers. `` Mister, you're smack in the middle of headache powder country,'' <PERSON> Gautier </PERSON>, told a reporter. `` We sell oodles of the stuff.'' She pointed to a shelf crammed full with packets of B.C., <PERSON> Stanback </PERSON> and Goody's, the last remaining brands in an industry that once had scores of competitors. The powdery concoction _ traditionally a potent mixture of aspirin and caffeine _ used to be called `` production powder'' in the tobacco and textile mills that proliferated throughout the Southeast after the turn of the century. `` The tobacco and textile mills were hot, noisy places and the... workers needed something that would give them quick relief from the long hours and bad working conditions,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, president and chief executive of Winston-Salem-based Goody's He noted the first powders came on the market around 1910. Dozens of druggists throughout the South _ and especially the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> _ came up with their own special formulas. In the late 1920s, <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> druggist M.C. `` Goody'' <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> combined powdered caffeine, aspirin and the analgesic acetaminophen. `` For lack of a beter name, he called his mixture ` Goody's,''' said Chambers. `` A local entrepreneur, <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewallen </PERSON>, purchased the rights to <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>'s creation in 1932 and began marketing Goody's across the region `` There were more than 100 companies back then, although some of them were one-man operations.'' Goody's has always been a <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> firm. The company currently occupies a renovated overalls factory just down the street from where <PERSON> Goody </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> used to dispense the original product over the counter. Chambers can recall the days when Goodys and competing powders were sold inside the mills from so-called `` dope carts'' that also offered cigarettes, coffee and cookies. `` They're still sold in the mills today, but through vending machines,'' he said. A packet of two powders sells for about half a dollar. The three companies that survived _ B.C., <ORGANIZATION> Goody </ORGANIZATION>'s and <PERSON> Stanback </PERSON> _ did so because they were better able to promote and market their product, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said. `` Marketing was the key because the ingredients were n't all that different.'' There's one notable exception to that: B.C. and Goody's still contain caffeine, but <PERSON> Stanback </PERSON> dropped the stimulant in 1984. `` It has n't worked worth a darn,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanback </PERSON>, son of the company's founder, said of the move <PERSON> Stanback </PERSON>, located at nearby <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION>, and Goody's are still small, family owned operations. B.C., which began in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, was bought out by the <ORGANIZATION> Block </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in the mid-1960s and was moved to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. Industry insiders generally recognize B.C., which was concocted in 1910 by the late <PERSON> Commodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Council </PERSON>, as being the first commercial headache powder to appear on the market The headache powder industry grew rapidly in the 1920s and ` 30s, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said. It continued to expand until World War II, when mechanization reduced the work forces at the plants and mills across the region. Today, headache powders account for about $ 50 million of the annual $ 1.4 billion analgesic market. They remain primarily a regional product. `` I'd never heard of headache powders when I came to the South a few years ago,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, chairman of the anthropology department at <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` Even now,'' he said, `` one of our medical residents occasionally will tell me about seeing a patient who told him he was taking <PERSON> Goody </PERSON>'s for his health problem. The resident will look at me and ask, ` What are these things, Goody's?''' Because of the industry's promotion efforts, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said, fewer people ask that question these days. `` Everybody thought the powders would die when the older users died off but, through our advertising and marketing, we've begun reaching a wider market,'' <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said. `` Used to be, most of our customers were rural farm people but the surveys show that the young have begun taking headache powers.'' <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, a 24-year-old store clerk in <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION>, said she became a regular user last year. `` I had a headache and did n't want to buy a whole bottle of tables,'' she recalled. `` Now I take a powder about every day.'' Novices should be warned that there is an art to taking the powders. `` Be sure and wash it down quick,'' <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said, grinning. <PERSON> Marcella </PERSON> <PERSON> Gautier </PERSON> can tell you this is sound advice. `` I never take those powders,'' she said. `` I tried one once and like to choked to death. I found you've got to be careful not to breathe in until you've swallowed all the powder.''

 <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>, with <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> drawl and swiveling hips, was one of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s `` Indian'' actors. So was <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who astounded audiences as <PERSON> Medea </PERSON> and the evil housekeeper in `` <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>,'' was another famous `` Indian'' actor, cast as <PERSON> Buffalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cow </PERSON> <PERSON> Head </PERSON> in `` A Man Called Horse.'' Today, the war paint may be off, but whites continue to play Indians, a casting practice all too common in an industry in which Indians comprise only a tiny percentage. Hollywood has long ignored accuracy and fairness in its hiring practices, using white actors to portray blacks, Asians and Hispanics. As far as Indian roles were concerned, all it took was a little burnt sienna pancake, cliche costumes and cartoon accents for white actors to be transformed into the `` red man.'' The latest motion picture about Indians is `` War Party,'' written by <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON>. The movie, to be released this fall by <ORGANIZATION> Hemdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Films </ORGANIZATION>, stars <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> as half-breeds living in <LOCATION> Binger </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, the site 100 years ago of the <LOCATION> Milk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION>, in which Black Cherokees were massacred by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers. <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> is part <PERSON> Huron </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> has no Indian blood. <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> is one of the few Indian actors who have managed to get work over the years. Others include Chief <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, who starred in 1971's `` Little Big Man''; Chief John Big Tree, used frequently by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, the grandson of <PERSON> Geronimo </PERSON> who appeared in Douglas Fairbanks Westerns. <PERSON> Roddam </PERSON>, who depicted British working-class kids in `` Quadrophenia'' and the plight of a black youth at a military academy in `` Lords of Discipline,'' used a largely Indian cast in `` War Party,'' but insisted that commercial considerations became more important when considering the leads. `` I took all these non-actors in,'' he said. `` I did a film test and trained them, but in the end the studio did n't feel they had the experience to be in a $ 9 million movie. If you want to make this movie, you're going to have to compromise on the main two guys.'' In `` War Party,'' <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> slays a local redneck in self defense and is forced to flee with <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> and other Indians. They eventually band together, vowing not to give in to the authorities. `` You can make a small film that no one will see like ` Pow Wow Highway,' or a larger film that a larger number of people will see,'' <PERSON> Roddam </PERSON> said. `` At the end of the film, you're cheering for these two Indian boys. You want them to win, you side with them. In ` Lords of Discipline,' you side with the black kid.'' To cast his movie, <PERSON> Roddam </PERSON> consulted the American Indian Registry for the Performing Arts, created in 1983 with the intention of finding work for Indians in the entertainment business. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, until recently the organization's executive director, dismissed the excuses usually given for casting non-Indians. `` Our numbers are so small that <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> has a tendency not to take us seriously,'' he said. `` Just the fact that they went and cast a non-Indian to play the lead because the director needed a strong person is proof. They'll always tell us that we did look at Indians but none of them could do the job.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wacks </PERSON> -LRB- `` Repo Man'' -RRB- traveled across the country searching for actors to star in `` Powwow Highway,'' a critical hit that failed at the box office earlier this year. `` We went to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sante </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> and were up in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. We did casting in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. There are very, very few experienced Indian actors, and virtually all of them are in the movie,'' he said. <PERSON> Wacks </PERSON> cast <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, a Mohawk who grew up on a reservation, and A <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who is part <LOCATION> Blackfoot </LOCATION>, as the leads in the movie about two <LOCATION> Cheyennes </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Buddy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bow </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Philbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> _ who travel from their reservation in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON>'s sister has been arrested for drug possession. `` There's more than enough talent out there _ there's a lot of talent,'' said Farmer. <PERSON> Roddam </PERSON>, however, said that casting Indians to play <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> was not absolutely necessary. `` It comes to the point where you say, ` Do you have to have a real killer play <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>?' I was committed to portraying the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> in a correct way. I filmed it in a real Indian town. The people on the reservation were just thrilled,'' he said. `` White liberals get very huffy about the way we portray Indians, but the people in the town were really thrilled. ... They appreciated that we were bringing this money into their economy.'' Through the end of 1988, there were 170 Indians in the 70,000-member Screen Actors Guild. Blacks numbered 5,247 and Hispanics 2,439. `` Certainly the guild's approach with respect to trying to remedy this situation is the go-slow approach,'' said <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, the guild's affirmative-action coordinator. `` We try to engage the producers in discussions and dialogue, secure their cooperation. That's the policy.'' <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s approach has been equally slow. According to the guild, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> were cast in only .3 percent of last year's film and television roles and .1 percent of TV commercials <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said producers do n't object to lobbying for minority casting, but do n't necessarily cooperate either. `` What we get are comments like, ` Well, you know our casting practices are based upon First Amendment protection. You ca n't tell us how to cast a film,''' he said. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> was pleased that `` Powwow Highway'' depicted Indians without `` buckskins and feathers,'' but does not expect <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> to continue the reality. `` They do n't seem to let us get out of those stereotypes,'' he said. `` We would like to see Indians playing doctors and lawyers and policeman. These things are not going to change until we do our own productions.''

 `` The only good Indian is a dead Indian.'' Such dialogue, so odious by today's standards, was common in Western movies a few decades ago. It stemmed from a remark attributed to Gen. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> when he was introduced to a Comanche chief in 1869. `` Me Tochoway,'' said the chief. `` Me good Indian.'' `` The only good Indians I ever saw were dead,'' snapped <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>. The attitude of the Indian fighter was illustrated in countless movies from 1920 to 1960. With rare exceptions, Indians were portrayed as bloodthirsty savages who were a menace to white maidens and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s manifest destiny. In the book `` The Western,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenin </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everson </PERSON> observe that film audiences seldom saw depictions of `` the tragedy of the Indian tribes, pushed backwards and backwards again in violation of treaties and agreements, their confinement to reservations where unscrupulous Indian agents exploited them shamelessly, the disintegration of their fighting spirit and their traditional desire to live in peace with the white man.''' T was not always so Earlier in the century, movies often focused on the `` noble savage'' with depictions of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fennimore </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s stories, the legends of <LOCATION> Hiawatha </LOCATION>, Pocahontas, <PERSON> Ramona </PERSON> As Westerns grew more epic in scope during the 1920s, Indians became ideal villains to maraud wagon trains, battle the cavalry and menace the heroine with `` a fate worse than death.'' Such portrayals continued from silent films into the talkies. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, the greatest of Western directors, made consistent use of the Indian menace. In his 1924 classic, `` The Iron Horse,'' railroad builders were attacked by hordes of <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION>, Pawnees and Cheyennes. The most memorable scene of the 1939 `` Stagecoach'' was the pursuit of the travelers by the swift-racing Indians. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s depiction of `` redskin savages'' continued in `` Fort Apache'' -LRB- 1948 -RRB-, `` She Wore a Yellow Ribbon'' -LRB- 1949 -RRB- and `` <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>'' -LRB- 1950 -RRB-. In `` The Searchers'' -LRB- 1956 -RRB-, <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> was a white captive who witnessed Indian atrocities and was the wife of a Comanche chief until rescued by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>. In his last Western, `` <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> Autumn'' -LRB- 1964 -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> seemed to seek expiation for his treatment of Indians. The film traced the bitter trek of Cheyennes from a bleak reservation in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> to their native land in the Northwest. Critics called `` <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> Autumn'' mawkish and deplored the `` Indian'' cast of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Roland </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalban </PERSON>, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Jory </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mineo </PERSON>. Such non-ethnic castings were common throughout <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> history. Among the whites who portrayed Indians are: <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Plainsman,'' `` They Died With Their Boots On'' -RRB-; <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> -LRB- `` Taza, Son of Cochise'' -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keel </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- `` The War Wagon'' -RRB-; <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> -LRB- `` Geronimo'' -RRB-; <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Darnell </PERSON> -LRB- `` Buffalo Bill'' -RRB-; <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Outsider'' -RRB-; <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Newmar </PERSON> -LRB- `` <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON>'s Gold'' -RRB-. <PERSON> Delmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Daves </PERSON>' `` Broken Arrow'' -LRB- 1950 -RRB- proved a watershed film in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s attitude toward the Indian. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> played a scout who marries an Indian woman and sympathizes with the Apache plight. `` Seldom thereafter did filmmakers have the nerve to depict Indians as if they were villains simply because they were red men,'' writes <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON> in `` Western Films.'' Despite the sympathetic view of `` Broken Arrow,'' Hollywood casting prevailed: <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Cochise </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Paget </PERSON> as the Indian maid. Later years brought more films supporting the Indians' cause: `` Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here'' -LRB- 1969 -RRB-, an Indian-turned-cowboy deals with prejudice; `` Soldier Blue'' -LRB- 1970 -RRB-, about two white survivors of an Indian attack who trek across the desert; `` A Man Called Horse'' -LRB- 1970 -RRB-, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' tour de force as the white aristocrat who lives with <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> and becomes their leader; and `` Little Big Man'' -LRB- 1971 -RRB-, a white man -LRB- <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> -RRB- recounts his history with Indians. In the 1980s, the Western has virtually disappeared as a film genre. But it still turns up on television, which apparently has much to learn about the Indian image. Two recent miniseries, `` Lonesome Dove'' and `` Around the World in 80 Days,'' portrayed Indians in the appalling cliche of the savage devoted to killing as many whites as possible.

 <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s `` The Satanic Verses'' went on sale a year ago and since then it has sold more than a million copies, raised religious and political furor and sent the author into hiding from assassins. He and his wife have split up, and no end to his predicament is in sight. The extraordinary furor that engulfed much of the world following <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death threat against the Indian-born author has subsided to a degree, and the international writing community is divided over whether it should go on speaking out in his behalf or fall silent in hopes that the threat will gradually evaporate. Three months after the publication of the novel on Sept. 26, 1988, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> ruled it was blasphemous and imposed a death sentence on the novelist, himself a Moslem and now a British subject, and his publishers. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic fundamentalist leadership put a $ 5.2 million price on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s head. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s leaders say the death threat issued Feb. 14 still stands despite <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death this past June. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, who has spent seven months living in British-intelligence safe houses, has vowed to continue writing while hoping for reconciliation. In a poem in the September issue of the British literary magazine <PERSON> Granta </PERSON>, the 42-year-old author wrote that he had chosen `` not to shut up. To sing on in spite of attack.'' The copyrighted 17-line poem, titled `` 6 March, 1989,'' was written 20 days after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> issued his edict. `` He's not free in a way a writer needs to be ... but some kind of commitment to the truth pushes him on,'' said the British novelist <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> McEwan </PERSON>. `` Nothing can stop him writing.'' <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> also has been doing occasional book reviews for The Observer, a British weekly newspaper, most recently one published Sept. 10 of <ORGANIZATION> E.L. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctorow </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bathgate </PERSON>,'' a novel about the American gangster Dutch <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>. According to <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, a friend and fellow writer, <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> is not completely isolated. `` In one sense, he is an Iranian hostage in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said in an interview. `` He meets who he wants to meet, within limits. He talks to his friends. But the tragedy is that he can not live at home amongst his books, his studies and his work.'' His wife, the American novelist <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, stopped living with him in July in what friends called `` a mutual breakup.'' Her publishers say only that she wants to be left alone and does not know where <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> now lives. Ms. <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, who married <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> in 1987, had given telephone interviews to British newspapers in which she said the couple had moved 56 times since police took them from their <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> home and put them into hiding. She spoke of the paranoia and isolation of their lives, where `` you can no longer pass down the street and encounter a stranger. You lose all sense of spontaneity because you live in fear.'' Some writers think the campaign for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> should be kept on the boil, while others say muting it would be in <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s best interest. In an interview, novelist <PERSON> McEwan </PERSON> welcomed the dropoff in media coverage, saying that at its height it `` made <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> feel more hunted.'' But <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Matre </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norwegian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>, suggested that `` publicity gives him protection.'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, who says he is in regular contact with <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, said: `` Clearly he wants the affair to end. He does n't want to do anything to provoke the fundamentalists, but he wants people to speak up in his favor. He knows perfectly what's at stake.'' <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Pullein-Thompson </PERSON>, general secretary of the English chapter of the international writers' group <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We support <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> to the hilt, but there's no point in shouting about it. It's the madmen you're going to stir, not the ordinary Moslems In a way, cooling it is a good thing.'' The diplomatic fallout has largely settled as well. Nations of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, joined by <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, withdrew their envoys from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in protest, but nearly all returned them within weeks. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> broke diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> recalled its ambassador again in May when President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said a bullet was still waiting for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. Militants among <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 2 million Moslems have staged book-burning demonstrations. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> 26 people have died in anti-Rushdie riots.

<TEXT>
 In the West, a thread of fear surfaces wherever `` The Satanic Verses'' is concerned. University students in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, planned a public reading but called it off after anonymous bomb threats were made. In the French edition of the book, the translator's name is nowhere to be seen. The West German edition was put out by a consortium of 90 publishers, to make it harder for terrorists to identify a target. Assassins killed the moderate imam, or prayer leader, of a mosque in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and his aide March 29. Imam <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ahdal </PERSON> had criticized the death sentence imposed by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. On Aug. 3 a bomb killed a man in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> hotel and an Islamic group claimed the man was preparing to use the bomb against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. On Sept. 13, a bomb caused minor damage at a bookstore owned by <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s publisher, the Viking Penguin group, in <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The store was closed at the time and there were no injuries. Another bomb was defused the same day at another Viking Penguin bookstore in <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION>. The office of the weekly newspaper <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Riverdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, was firebombed Feb. 28 after publishing an editorial defending `` The Satanic Verses.'' Two bookstores in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, were firebombed the same day, and five stores in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> were bombed from April 9 to Sept. 3 in attacks that authorities said could be related to the book. A Dutch retail chain stopped selling the book Aug. 31 after receiving a threat, and dozens of bookstores across <LOCATION> Westesn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> keep it under the counter or have refused to stock it. Islamic fundamentalists have said the death threat can be lifted only if <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> admits he sinned and every copy of the book is burned. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> apologized Feb. 18 for any offense to Moslems, but he refused to recant, and it is clearly too late to withdraw the book. It has been on best-seller lists in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since its publication and has gone into multiple printings there. More than 1.1 million hardback copies have been sold worldwide, including more than 600,000 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said sources at <LOCATION> Viking </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penguin </LOCATION>, and translations have been published or are appearing soon in nine European countries. The uproar has made it `` book of the year,'' said <PERSON> Remo </PERSON> <PERSON> Croce </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Booksellers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, it is publisher <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourgois </PERSON>' biggest commercial success, said an aide. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the novel has been on best-seller lists for eight months, and anti-censorship groups are anxious to see it in paperback. `` If the paperback does not come out, that is creeping censorship,'' said <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Souza </PERSON>, director of Article 19, a London-based free-speech organization that has collected 12,000 signatures worldwide, many from major writers, on a petition for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Kalim </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said there will be no letup in the campaign against the book. `` <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> will serve a very long life sentence protected by the British government,'' he said in an interview. `` His own plight is a very small part of the total misery he has caused.'' The 46-nation <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> has banned the book, along with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was the only conference member that unequivocally supported <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death threat. The others said <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> should first be tried by an Islamic court. Islamic leaders say the affair has worsened the alienation of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s 5 million Moslems. Firebombs have been thrown at two mosques in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and ugly rumblings have come from the European far right, demanding the expulsion of Moslems. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> has given no interviews. Friends say he is coping well despite the breakup of his marriage and is writing a children's book. `` Intellectually he is in good spirits,'' said <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>. `` He is not cowed by the fundamentalists. ... Come what may, his book will haunt the Islamic world forever.''

 It says something about the book put out by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> that the major complaint from readers is that it is too heavy to read in bed. Most people do n't take an encylcopedia to bed It says something, too, about the eight-pound, three-ounce Encyclopedia of Southern Culture that not many people except for the citizens of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, have found much that was left out. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> complains because it did n't get an entry of its own, making it appear, perhaps, less Southern than <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. This massive and ambitious $ 50, 1,600-page compendium of `` the cultural landscape of the South'' _ exploring everything from <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Moon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pies </ORGANIZATION> _ was published this summer. Even before it came out, the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> carried a piece offering a carload of mint juleps if the book would just include <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. `` It was a very attractive offer,'' says <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON>, son of a soybean farmer, now director of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION>, but in defining what constitutes Dixie `` we had to draw the line somewhere and we basically drew it between <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.'' As for the rest of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and its institutions, folkways, foods, burdens, icons, topics, attitudes, crops and hangups, `` to my knowledge, there have been no real omissions,'' says <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON>. Which says a lot. Edited jointly by <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON>, a folklorist, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a historian, and 10 years in the works -LRB- it was supposed to have taken four -RRB-, the encyclopedia has 800 contributors, including novelists, theologians, lawyers, psychologists, historians, sociologists. They're specialists on everything from the role violence, race and religion have played on the psyche of the South to the history of the Goo Goo Cluster -LRB- `` the South's favorite candy,'' it got its name, legend says, from the first utterance of the infant son of its creator, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, in 1912 -RRB-. The encyclopedia offers <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s distinction between a good old boy and a redneck. The former rides around in a pickup drinking beer and puts his empties in a sack; the latter rides around in a pickup drinking beer and tossing his empties out the window. <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> says the criticism he's heard most often from readers concerned the book's size, but some critics have complained about imbalance. Reviewer <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardley </PERSON> felt there was too much <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, too little <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>, too much <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON>, not enough <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Egerton </PERSON>, author of `` Southern Food: At Home, On the <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, In History,'' complained he could n't find entries on <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Earl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION>, Happy Chandler, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON> or <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON> and not enough on Southern politics and rivers. Never mind. The book still swarms with the stuff that makes the South distinctive. The flavor is conveyed by just a smattering from the A, B and C entries in the index: _ A: Air conditioning -LRB- `` Ask any southerner over 30 years of age to explain why the South has changed in recent decades, and he may begin with the civil rights movement or industrialization But sooner or later he will come around to the subject of air conditioning.'' -RRB-. The <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> Show. Armadillos -LRB- come out at night, live on insects and worms, voted in 1971 by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION> to replace the longhorn as the school symbol, but never acted upon -RRB-. _ B: Barbecue -LRB- `` three topics upon which Southerners never agree are religion, politics and barbecue'' -RRB- The Beverly Hillbillies. The Bible Belt. The Blues. The <PERSON> Boll </PERSON> <PERSON> Weevil </PERSON> -LRB- `` During the initial infestation many communities exclusively dependent on cotton underwent boll weevil panics or depressions similar to other economic depressions.'' -RRB-. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> `` Bear'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> Shave signs -LRB- `` Missin' _ <PERSON> Kissin </PERSON>'? _ Perhaps Your Thrush _ Ca n't Get Thru _ The Underbrush _ Try _ <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> Shave'' -RRB-. _ C: Catfish -LRB- `` Southerners have never aligned themselves as closely with any cold-blooded creature as they have with the feline-looking catfish.'' -RRB- Chitterlings. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- once called `` the holy water of the American South'' -RRB-. Company towns -LRB- `` The right to occupancy was dependent upon employment. If out on strike, or ill, or injured, a worker and his family could be evicted on short notice.'' -RRB-.

A first printing of 15,000 sold out quickly; a second printing is in the works. He thinks it says something about the country that, despite the homogenizing effects of television, mobility, urbanity and the Interstate highway system, interest in regionalism is taking on new strength. `` A sense of being a Southerner, a New Yorker or Midwesterner persists,'' says <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON>. `` I think Americans are realizing that their regions are at the heart of their own identities as Americans.''

<HEAD>Food Aid Demands Help Prompt Greater U.S. Wheat Output</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A decision to rebuild <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food aid reserves by offering farmers the option of planting additional wheat for the 1990 harvest comes as global donations to hungry nations are the smallest in six years. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> announced last week that wheat farmers may, if they choose, boost plantings for 1990. Farmers now will be allowed to plant more than 95 percent of their wheat base acreage, up to a limit of 105 percent. `` This action is necessary to maintain our humanitarian food aid commitments while adding slightly to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carryover supplies following two consecutive years of drought,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. Department analysts estimated that the option will boost the 1990 wheat acreage for harvest by about 2.1 million acres to 69.6 million. Total wheat production could rise by 66 million bushels to a projected 2.596 billion bushels next year. An increase of 66 million bushels due to <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s decision would be equal to 1.8 million metric tons, which would approximately offset the 1.5 million tons of wheat authorized by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to be released for donations as humanitarian food aid. But <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said an additional 2 million metric tons has been requested for the 1990 fiscal year that will begin on Oct. 1. The wheat is part of a special reserve of 4 million tons established by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 to help meet global emergency food demands. It had not been tapped until President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cleared the way last October. According to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts, tight grain supplies and higher prices have put financial pressure on donor nations. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> estimates world cereal aid shipments in the 1988-89 trade year that ended June 30 dropped to below 9.8 million tons, the smallest amount since 1983-84. A report by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the 1988-89 shipments were down 25 percent from the previous year, the sharpest one-year decline in 15 years. Even so, they were still above the levels of shipments in the early 1980s. `` According to the estimates, 1988-89 was the first time in four years that cereal aid shipments fell below the 1974 <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> target of 10 million tons,'' the report said. `` Given continuing tight world supplies, cereal aid shipments likely will decline again in 1989-90.'' Cereals, mostly wheat, make up the overwhelming volume of world food aid, the report said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the biggest donor, accounting for 56 percent of last year's food aid total. Others include the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, 20 percent; <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, 10 percent; <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, 4 percent; and <LOCATION> Austalia </LOCATION>, 3 percent. Analysts said that some buildup in wheat stockpiles may be on the horizon with improved weather conditions and larger plantings. `` Two years of stronger prices could boost foreign exporter plantings and production,'' the report said. `` These gains should mean that exporters will begin rebuilding stocks, that prices will weaken and that food aid budgets will permit a somewhat larger volume of shipments.'' But it cautioned that world demand for grain continues to grow and that the rebuilding process will be gradual. `` In the near term, the world will have only a small cushion against a major production shock that could send prices up sharply,'' the report said.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, assembly plant will close in mid-March and production of the cars made there will shift to other plants, the company said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union swiftly criticized the decision, saying it `` sends a message of defeat and a message of failure'' in GM-UAW relations. The plant employs about 2,200 people, 250 of whom are salaried. About 1,000 of the employees are on indefinite layoff, a <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> statement said. Provisions are being made to ensure they get all the benefits to which they are entitled, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We want to give our employees as much time as possible to prepare for this,'' said <PERSON> A.M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beirne </PERSON>, head of manufacturing for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> The <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION> plant makes the Chevrolet Caprice and the <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wagon </ORGANIZATION>. The Caprice also is made at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, plant. <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustin </PERSON> said the station wagon will be built beyond mid-March, but he could n't say where. `` General Motors management is not trying nearly hard enough to fulfill its obligations under the national agreement and to source offshore production back into domestic plants if necessary to maintain employment here,'' said <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yokich </PERSON>, in charge of the union's <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> department. `` There's still time for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> to demonstrate that it truly wants a new relationship with the union and union workers,'' <PERSON> Yokich </PERSON> said in an apparent reference to negotiations, which will begin next summer. The UAW-GM national contract expires exactly a year after <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement Thursday <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> began producing cars at the plant in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in 1929. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> would not comment on the production rate, but a study of automotive capacity by <ORGANIZATION> Autofacts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Paoli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said the plant had a capacity of 145,000 cars a year at a line rate of 37.75 an hour on two shifts. Caprice sales through Sept. 10 of this year were 116,288, down 3.6 percent from last year. Sales of the Buick wagon were down 15 percent to 6,536 cars. As of Sept. 10, all of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s North American-made cars were selling at a rate 7.1 percent below last year's.

<HEAD>Strong Growth in World Trade Expected to Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The volume of world merchandise trade is expected to increase by about 7 percent in 1989 and growth will likely remain strong in the next few years, the organization that sponsors trade-liberalizing agreements said today. In an optimistic report, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade said technological progress, the fall in the price of oil and new national economic policies were among factors behind `` unexpectedly high'' recent growth in international commerce. It said trade in services such as tourism and banking had grown even faster than merchandise trade during the 1980s and reached an estimated value of about $ 560 billion last year. Merchandise exports were worth an estimated $ 2.88 trillion in 1988, 14.5 percent higher than the previous year. The volume of goods traded increased by 8.5 percent, a record for the 1980s, the report said. Despite the expansion in world trade, many Third World countries suffered a drop in export earnings during the decade, the report said. It warned that the world's poorest countries can no longer rely on exports of commodities, which account for three-quarters of their foreign exchange, to fuel economic growth. Examining the reasons for the expansion of international commerce, <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> said one factor was technological innovations that have increased the scope of goods and services that can be traded on world markets. The halving of the price of oil since the 1980 peak, the rising share of manufactured products in trade, and the increase in the number of international mergers were also responsible, the report said. Economic reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, relatively low inflation in Western countries, deregulation of business and freeing of capital movements further combined to boost world trade and open up international markets, the report said. In the longer term, <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> predicted the world economy `` may have entered a period in which the average growth rates for output and trade ... will be higher than they have been since the onset of economic difficulties in the late 1960s and the early 1970s.'' <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said this forecast covered the next five to 10 years. The 97 nations that belong to the trade forum account for over four-fifths of world trade. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> became a member of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> last month.

 Five activists chained themselves to a banister at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to protest the high cost of AZT, a drug used to treat AIDS. Three of the five, members of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, were described as having AIDS or AIDS-related complex. According to <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsin </PERSON>, vice president for media relations at the exchange, the incident occurred at the start of trading Thursday, 9:30 a.m. The five, dressed as floor traders and wearing fake brokerage firm IDs, chained themselves to a banister of a balcony overlooking the exchange floor. There, they unfurled a banner that read, `` SELL <ORGANIZATION> WELLCOME </ORGANIZATION>'' _ a reference to <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION>, manufacturer of AZT _ and set off miniature fog horns. Ms. <PERSON> Gamsin </PERSON> said the five were removed by guards and turned over to police. `` We will file charges against them,'' she said. She noted that <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> is traded over the counter, not on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Federal studies have found that AZT is effective in slowing the course of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, but it costs $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 a year. <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> is the sole manufacturer of the drug, and company officials have said the high price is necessary to pay for manufacturing and for research.

<HEAD>House Panel Backs Bill Aimed at Ozone-Depleting Chemical Makers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to legislation that would siphon off $ 4.3 billion over five years from profits of companies making ozone-depleting chemicals. The provision, approved Thursday, was added to a tax and entitlement bill. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has sought such a revenue-raising measure because it targets windfall profits that chemical firms could earn after an international treaty reduces supplies of chlorofluorocarbons. The so-called <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s destroy the ozone layer in the stratosphere and increase the risk of skin cancer. There is similar language pending before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The proposal, which the Ways and Means panel labels a `` tax on ozone-depleting chemicals,'' would bring in an estimated $ 362 million in the 1990 fiscal year, while revenues in the following four years were put, respectively, at $ 614 million, $ 753 million, $ 1.1 billion and $ 1.4 billion. The tax would become effective Jan. 1. The chemical industry denies there will be windfall profits after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> begins implementing the Montreal Protocol, a 1987 international agreement to cut production of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s The theory behind the tax is that demand will far outstrip supply once production is frozen at 1986 levels The protocol requires that by 1998, production can be only 50 percent of the 1986 figures. The five manufacturers of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s are developing substitutes, but they are reportedly three to five years away from production.

<HEAD>Business Group Alleges Budget Cuts Are Mostly Phony</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business leaders have called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to end what the group charged was a budget charade and begin work on a realistic effort to cut the federal deficit. The <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, composed of executives from some of the country's top corporations, issued a report Thursday that charged that the bipartisan budget agreement between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` dodged the important budgetary issues and made little substantive and lasting improvement in the outlook for the deficit.'' That agreement, covering the fiscal year which begins Oct. 1, is designed to meet the legal target of reducing the budget deficit from an expected $ 150 billion this year down to $ 100 billion in 1990. But the committee's report charged that more than one-third of the projected savings in the bipartisan agreement were composed of `` one-time savings, accounting gimmicks and other smoke and mirrors that merely improve the appearances of the budget.'' The report, titled `` Battling <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Budget Deficits,'' also called for trimming <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, saying that significant deficit reductions could not be made unless these huge middle-class entitlement programs were scaled back. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ash </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> in the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration and a member of the panel which prepared the CED report, said that official <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was currently `` obfuscating, misleading and deceiving the public'' about the deficit crisis facing the country. The committee proposed a program to trim the deficit by $ 40 billion to $ 50 billion each year through a combination of budget cuts and unspecified tax hikes. Members of the group said they took no stand on which taxes to increase because they could not reach consensus, although some said they favored creation of a consumption-based tax such as the Value Added Tax used by many European nations. The recommendations of the group were being presented to <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> and congressional budget leaders, according to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, president of the CED and a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> complained that the country's deficit woes were not as dominant in the news currently as they were a few years ago, even though the problem is far from being solved. `` The deficit problem today rarely makes front page news,'' he said. `` The result is that few people care deeply about the issue and our political system feels little pressure to tackle it effectively.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Committe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> is a non-profit research group composed of 250 business and education leaders.

<HEAD>Lawn and Garden Industry Looks To Boom In 1990s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The lawn and garden industry has to be nimble to deal with fickle weather _ drought last year wilted national sales 11 percent to $ 15.5 billion _ but retailers are poised for fast growth in the 1990s, experts say. In trend-setting <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, lawn and garden sales grew 9 percent to $ 3.8 billion in 1988, and part of the reason was a switch by homeowners to plants and irrigation systems that use less water. `` Weather is the primary factor that affects this industry and it's something the industry has no control over,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Garden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, during a visit to the huge Pacific Horticultural Trade Show here. `` Rain drenched the Southeast and East this summer and hurt sales. But there are some shifts occurring out there in the marketplace, and the future looks bright,'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. `` The Baby Boom generation,'' he said, `` is probably the best segment of the marketplace out there for gardening, and it's going to drive this industry into the 1990s, along with the ` 50-50' generation _ people who are 50 years old and have a $ 50,000-plus annual income. As the Baby Boomers, approaching or just over 40, become more established in homes, they are spending more money to spruce up gardens and lawns for both enjoyment and investment. `` We did a nationwide study and found new homeowners felt that a well-landscaped home could add up to 15 percent of real estate value,'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. `` It was as good or better investment as remodeling the kitchen or bath when it came time to sell that home.'' Limited garden space and a new influx of immigrants also are having an impact on garden suppliers. The nursery of the'90s is likely to sell more container plants, dwarf trees and fruit trees popular in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` We're selling more dwarf citrus trees, which do n't take up as much space and bear a ` manageable' amount of fruit for today's smaller family,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of Four Winds Nursery in <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION> Garden suppliers, <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said, report four types of landscapes increasingly being installed at <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> homes: _ An area for public view that looks good but requires low maintenance _ A grassy play area for children with less emphasis on flowers _ An entertainment area with movable furniture _ The garden retreat, where people can sit and read or just get away from it all, integrating water, flowers, rocks, bridges and exotic furniture But no matter which landscape is selected, thought has to be given to water use and cyclical bouts of heat and drought. Gardening tips being distributed at many retail nurseries teach homeowners how to conserve water and maintain landscapes through proper design, grouping of plant material, correct planting methods and mulching, as well as water-saving practices. Among the products on display at the Pacific Horticultural Trade Show are several that save water: crystals that hold water like tiny reservoirs around the roots of plants, root sponges that reduce watering after transplanting, drip irrigation systems, and planters that have built-in reservoirs and moisture control sensors that turn the watering function on and off as needed.

<TEXT>
 The battered junk bond market is anxiously waiting to see whether <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> can snatch its prime retail operations from the precipice of default. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to make a loan payment today reported to be in the $ 50 million range, but <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> needs an outside infusion of cash to prevent a default. In the junk bond market, where trading of the high-yield, high-risk securities took a gut-wrenching hit earlier this week, `` everybody is looking to see how <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> gets out of this mess, because it could have a big effect on everything,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Advest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Admissions that both <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> units could default on their debt payments triggered a broad junk bond selloff earlier this week that spread to issues regarded as among the most stable and attractive. Critics have long contended that junk bonds, typically used to finance expensive, highly leveraged takeovers, were ripe for a fall. The thinking goes that companies would default on interest payments either because they would be unable to sell divisions at the heady prices they anticipated or because cash flows would not live up to expectations. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON>, head of the Toronto-based real estate and retail concern, was scrambling to line up financing from <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> to pay the debt. Any success in getting more financing for Allied and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, which are in dire need of credit so they can stock up on inventory ahead of the Christmas shopping season, would help not only to prop up those precarious issues but the junk market in general. Traders fear that if the market is widely perceived as too risky and unstable, investors will dump their holdings. `` If too many people start jumping on the band wagon, the -LRB- junk-bond -RRB- mutual fund managers are not going to have enough cash to cover redemptions, and they're going to be forced to blow out of their positions,'' one observer said. So far traders said they had not detected any significant selling by mutual funds that invest in junk bonds. <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said managers `` are studying the situation'' and are not likely to act hastily. `` Besides, the whole thing is up in the air,'' he said, noting that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> could succeed in its restructuring plans. While some market experts said this week's selloff was particularly significant because more stable, attractive issues fell in tandem with distressed bonds, others contend the downturn was due. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, characterized the decline as more of a `` technical correction'' because prices had been on the upswing recently. Furthermore, there has been no change in the credit quality of most companies, he said. Yields quoted on some Allied and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> issues have soared well above 25 percent to compensate for heightened risk. But, said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Naylor </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Rodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renshaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, `` When a bond is trading at a 25 percent yield, it means they're not going to pay.'' <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> used billions of dollars from the sale of junk bonds to finance its $ 8.8 billion takeover of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> last year. Not only did he pay top dollar for the retail company, but a stagnant consumer market dashed his plans for relying on cash flow to pay down the debt. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> put its flagship <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s department store chain on the auction block in an effort to raise cash.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s lawyers say they are n't picking a fight with the press in an attempt to squelch alleged leaks by government prosecutors in the highly publicized securities fraud and racketeering case. In court papers filed this week, lawyers for the former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> high-yield bond division leader claim that `` a constant stream'' of press leaks is threatening <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s right to a fair trial. The motion asks <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Kimba </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> to order the government to stop leaking confidential material, hold a hearing to identify the sources of the leaks, punish the leakers and make public a confidential <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> memo written about in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. No members of the media would be called at any hearing on the motion because `` we are not interested in confrontations with the press,'' the motion adds. The lawyers claim the government has turned confidential grand jury proceedings into `` a spectator sport'' by releasing information about the <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> probe repeatedly over the last three years to pressure witnesses and other possible targets to cooperate. The motion, filed Wednesday in federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, claims the alleged leaking `` flatly violates'' federal criminal regulations and other legal and ethical rules requiring confidentiality in government investigations. `` We are asking the court to stop the government from continuing its leaking and to punish those government officials responsible,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Flumenbaum </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, said Thursday. A hearing to ferret out media leaks would not be unprecedented. The motion cites the 1980 bank fraud case of former <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration budget director <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, in which a federal appeals court ordered such a hearing. Though the <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> motion seeks to exclude reporters, `` Motions like this have the potential for leading to First Amendment confrontations with the press,'' according to one prominent First Amendment attorney, who asked not to be identified. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, his brother, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, and former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> trader <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> were charged March 29 in a 98-count fraud and racketeering indictment that alleges insider trading, securities law violations and other crimes in the broadest action of the government's Wall Street crackdown. They pleaded innocent and a March 1990 trial is set. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> was first named in news reports as the government's main target shortly after now-jailed stock speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in late 1986. Newspaper stories since then regularly have contained advance details of the government's investigation and indictment plans, including the charges. The <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> motion cites stories published in The Wall Street Journal, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> about the case quoting `` sources close to the investigation'' or `` people familiar with the government's investigation.'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns The <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, said the newspaper does not comment on its sourcing policies `` Our job is to try to find out what people are doing. That's what we do, added <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Baron </PERSON>, business editor of The Los Angeles Times The 31-page motion states that, `` The government has presented _ and is continuing to present _ its case to the grand jurors as much through the pages of the daily papers as through the testimony of witnesses in the grand jury room.'' The document cites three recent stories in the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> based on a confidential May 1988 <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> report containing details of secret testimony of government witnesses, and other articles specifying the contents of a new <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> indictment expected in October. The leaks are the result of `` decisions by some in the government to use publicity as a prosecutorial weapon, carefully timing the disclosures to ` pressure' defendants, witnesses and those under investigation,'' the motion states. An <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman declined to comment on the memo. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's said it would respond to the motion in court.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice for chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, pledges to crack down hard on inside traders but says his No. 1 problem is improving the pay of the agency's staff. The nominee told senators at his confirmation hearing Thursday that he would `` absolutely'' continue the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s current efforts `` to root fraud out of the securities markets.'' But <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> also said pay increases for <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> staffers were necessary to attract new talent and cut the agency's high turnover rate. `` I do n't know of any single issue facing the commission today that is more important than our ability to maintain the caliber and the quality of the staff,'' <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> said. The starting salary for an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> staff attorney is $ 27,130 _ well below what a top law school graduate can make at a Wall Street law firm, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> officials said. In a morning-long hearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, who once headed a task force on deregulation of the financial industry, said he believed in free, competitive markets. But, he added, `` Free markets do n't work if investors or participants believe they are dominated by fraud or corruption.'' The committee will decide if <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>'s nomination should be recommended to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think you can do an exceptional job, but it wo n't be easy,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., adding that he intended to vote for <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>'s confirmation After the hearing, <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> told reporters he expected a confirmation vote would come `` in a few days.'' <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> noted <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> still had to supply detailed answers to written questions posed by the committee staff. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, a White House aide who helped write the legislation to bail out the nation's savings and loan industry, was tapped by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> post last month. At the time, <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> and other senators expressed skepticism about the banking lawyer's experience in the securities industry. But the promised public grilling of the nominee never materialized, apparently due to <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>'s impressive performance in private meetings with committee members earlier this week. Several senators remarked about those private meetings in praising <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>'s intelligence and candor during the hearing. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> told Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., that it's `` a perfectly legitimate role of government to keep the markets clean. He said that would restore individual investors' confidence in the markets and attract foreign investment. When <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> expressed hope that wrongdoers would find <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> a `` fair but tough cop on the beat,'' <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> replied, `` Certainly, if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed, under my leadership that will be the case.'' <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> appeared relaxed but cautious as he answered committee members' questions, constantly asserting that his views were his own and he could n't speak for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. He said the $ 200 billion junk bond market `` is worth the careful attention of the commission'' although he was `` not suggesting there's any particular problem in the market today.'' <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> also said he did n't think the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> had been `` overzealous'' in its pursuit of insider trading and said the charges against the investment banking giant <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> were for more than `` harmless technical problems.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and the rival <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> should remain separate agencies and called for a better working relationship, including staff exchanges, with the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>, which has disputed the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> jurisdiction over some new financial instruments that have elements of both securities and futures contracts.

<TEXT>
 Cadillac should hang on to its share of the luxury car market in 1990 despite the entry of two Japanese luxury car lines this year, the division's general manager says. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Grettenberger </PERSON> also said Thursday that the popularity of <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s Infiniti line and <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s Lexus cars would be watched closely by Cadillac officials. Lexus cars officially went on sale Sept. 1, but some had been sold before they arrived in showrooms. Infiniti's two models go on sale Nov. 8. `` We're not taking it lightly at all,'' <PERSON> Grettenberger </PERSON> said during <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION>'s 1990 introduction. `` I'm not surprised that Cadillac owners are susceptible.'' A survey by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, showed that of 200 people who bought Lexus cars during the first month of sale, 12.2 percent of them traded in Cadillacs and 6.1 percent switched from Lincolns. Early predictions by Lexus officials forecast that about 10 percent of the cars traded in on their two models would be Cadillacs or Lincolns. Many more people would trade in European luxury cars, including Mercedes and BMW, and others would step up to Lexus from other Toyota-made cars, they said. Infiniti's two cars will be in about 50 Infiniti dealers on Nov. 8. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, Infiniti's national advertising director, said Thursday the division had not predicted the kinds of cars that would be traded in. However, he added, Infiniti had a long-range goal of capturing buyers moving into the luxury segment for the first time. <PERSON> Grettenberger </PERSON> said it was understandable that a large percentage of trade-ins would be Cadillacs since <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> is the largest player in the luxury car market, holding about 26.8 percent of it. `` There's no question that the newest products from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will represent formidable competition,'' <PERSON> Grettenberger </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cadillac </PERSON>'s base prices for 1990 range from $ 26,960 to $ 36,980 with the Allante's prices at $ 50,900 for the new convertible-only version at $ 50,900 and $ 56,533 for the model with a removable hardtop, the same price as last year. Lexus' two cars carry base prices of $ 21,050 and $ 35,000, and Infiniti cars cost $ 23,500 and $ 38,000. `` They've done a very good job of preparing the market for the car,'' <PERSON> Grettenberger </PERSON> said of Lexus. `` It will be interesting to see if they can maintain this level over the next couple of months.'' Lexus has forecast annual sales of about 75,000 cars, about one-fourth <PERSON> Cadillac </PERSON>'s prediction. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> said Infiniti would make no sales projections for the first year. <PERSON> Grettenberger </PERSON> said he expected <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> to continue to command the lion's share of the luxury car market. holding on to its 26.8 percent share. Asked where Lexus and Infiniti would get their buyers, <PERSON> Grettenberger </PERSON> said they most likely would come from the European makers. `` Luxury car buyers like to buy new things,'' he said. For 1990, <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> has kept the basic exterior designs of its entire line. It is introducing the convertible <PERSON> Allante </PERSON>, adding a traction control system for the two-seater. It also is putting more powerful engines in the <LOCATION> De </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ville </LOCATION>, Fleetwood, <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eldorado </LOCATION> models. In addition, <PERSON> Cadillac </PERSON> is making other changes in all its cars, none of which will affect how the vehicles look.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s chief supplier of hydraulic aircraft landing gear has agreed to repay the government about $ 1.4 million in contract overcharges for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s largest transport plane. The government claimed that labor charges on a $ 6.7 million contract were twice as high as original estimates by the company, <ORGANIZATION> Curtiss-Wright </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ridgefield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The contract was for 60 spare landing gear actuators that control landing gear, flaps and other moveable exterior systems on the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> C-5A Galaxy. <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said the company's failure to provide <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> auditors with labor standards and data on the company's internal cost estimates `` led to a gross inflation of the labor costs.'' Curtiss-Wright has denied any wrongdoing. Attempts to reach corporate officials after the settlement was announced Thursday evening were unsuccessful and the switchboard at the company's headquarters was closed The government contends <ORGANIZATION> Curtiss-Wright </ORGANIZATION>'s contract was based on a company estimate of 46,000 labor hours for the contract. <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said investigators found the contract was completed in 23,000 hours. `` The company's failure to live up to its certification with respect to the C-5A flight actuators subjected it to civil liability,'' <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said in a statement. Under the False Claims Act, a Civil War-era statute aimed at wartime profiteers, the government can demand reimbursement when it can prove a contractor was not negotiated in good faith. The act was further bolstered in 1986 by amendments that allow the government to claim triple damages and apply large fines. <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said the claims were not part of criminal or civil court proceedings but were the result of a preliminary investigation by his office and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

 The former head of <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has pleaded guilty to conspiracy and wire fraud for his role in a scheme to try to sell confidential company documents. <PERSON> Orin </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, 65, of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, entered the plea in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $ 500,00 fine when sentenced Nov. 16. An attorney whose firm once worked for <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> was indicted Thursday for his alleged role in the same scheme. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> said <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> and the lawyer, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>, were involved in a secret scheme to defraud <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> by attempting to sell confidential papers to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which was involved in a dispute with <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>. The documents dealt with the 1979 sale of $ 283 million in crude oil from the Iranian company to <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary in <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>. Court papers said <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> never paid for the oil. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive from 1974 to 1981. He was a consultant to <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>, earning $ 425,000 a year, from 1981 to 1984. In 1982, while he was a paid consultant, <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> received about 260 privileged documents about the oil sale through an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> employee, <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> said. According to the indictment against <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> made repeated attempts from 1982 to 1988 to sell the documents and <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>' consulting services to the Iranian company. They had planned to use a Swiss bank account to receive their payment, it said. As compensation, <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> asked for 25 percent of the Iranian company's recovery from <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>, the indictment alleged. In court Thursday, <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said the deal was never finalized although representatives of the Iranian company were allowed to view the documents in 1985. After seeing the papers, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> sued <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> Overseas for payment on the oil. Those suits, filed in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, were settled last week when <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay $ 325 million, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Herve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gouraige </PERSON>. Neither Ashland or <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> were charged with any wrongdoing. <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> praised the cooperation of Ashland in the investigation. <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, was charged with conspiracy and six counts of wire fraud. If convicted, he faces five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine on each count. He was not in custody and was scheduled to be arraigned Sept. 21. An earlier complaint charging <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON> with interstate transportation of stolen property was dismissed during the investigation that led to the latest charges. <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> was identifed as a former partner in the law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Barnett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Alagia </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, with offices around the country. The indictment said the firm represented <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> in certain legal matters while <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> was chairman. <PERSON> Gouraige </PERSON> declined to discuss why the earlier complaint against <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON> was dismissed.

The regional telephone company announced Thursday it would offer early retirement incentives aimed at cutting 1,000 to 1,200 managers and said it is also considering several financial moves such as refinancing some debts and revaluing spare parts inventories. The reorganization will lead to the company's first quarterly drop in profit since it was created in 1984 by the breakup of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> will break even or make a small profit in the fourth quarter, officials said For the same period last year, the company made $ 1.53 per share. In the second quarter of this year, the company's net income rose 4.9 percent to $ 360.8 million, or $ 1.84 per share. `` We think the time to change is when you're doing well,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mollura </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` If you wait until things go bad, it's too late.'' `` In a very real sense we are laying the groundwork for the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> of the future,'' <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, said in a news release. Managers will be offered cash incentives and pension benefits to retire early, the company said. The company will eliminate one level of management, based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, overseeing the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Potomac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> companies in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The four telephone companies will report directly to <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campanella </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> president. Duties at the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> headquarters will be absorbed by other units and the employees will be reassigned, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> said. Several internal operations such as office planning, the motor pool, real estate management and administrative services will be centralized. `` While change always will be with us, we expect this will be the last major reorganization for the foreseeable future,'' <PERSON> Campanella </PERSON> said. The company is considering seeking lower interest rates on debts owed by <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Potomac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and by <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. Other possible moves include revaluations of spare parts in its computer maintenance business and reducing the book value of its assets of smaller subsidiaries. The moves would decrease earnings in one quarter but give a `` slight lift'' to earnings in 1990, said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> chief financial officer. <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> said the recent three-week strike by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> played no part in the restructuring decision or its timing. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>'s seven subsidiaries are <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> companies in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> usurped federal authority and picked on <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> by suing it for false advertising, according to the cereal maker's countersuit against the state. The Quaker suit, filed a week after <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> sued the Chicago-based company, accuses the attorney general and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> of violating <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION>'s rights to freedom of speech and equal protection under the law. <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> claimed the country's No. 1 maker of hot cereal misleads consumers through advertising claims that its product can help reduce the risk of heart disease by helping lower cholesterol <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION>'s suit, filed Thursday, asks a federal judge to declare <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION>'s advertising truthful and to prevent <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> from interfering. It also asks for unspecified damages, noting <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION>'s name `` has come to be recognized by consumers as signifying wholesome and nutritious food products, and is accorded very high consumer loyalty and brand recognition.'' <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON>'s suit, originally filed in state district court, was switched to federal court with the filing of <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION>'s suit. `` It does n't matter to us whether we win this case in state court or federal court,'' said <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dusek </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. `` It does n't matter if they counter-sue or shoot off a cannon. We're going to prove that they illegally misrepresented their product in their advertising. The Quaker suit claims <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON>'s action violates federal antitrust laws, places unlawful restraints on interstate commerce and puts <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> at a competitive disadvantage. `` There are several competitors of Quaker Oats, both national and regional, that are selling food products containing oats or oat bran and who are making similar or stronger claims for their products,'' <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> said. `` Yet, the attorney general has selectively challenged only <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION>' advertising.'' The Quaker suit also cites examples of several studies indicating bran is effective in reducing serum cholesterol, thereby reducing the risk of heart attack. Since last week, <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> has repeatedly noted that its ads were approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. But, <PERSON> Dusek </PERSON> said lax regulation and protection of consumers `` is why the states ... took it upon themselves to form task forces to deal with problems that the federal government has decided it does n't want to deal with.'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has led nine other states in policing truth-in-advertising and other consumer protection areas. Other targets have included <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Carnation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, all of which deny they have used misleading advertising or violated consumer protection laws. <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION>'s suit also attacks this coalition, claiming it is an unconstitutional `` compact'' among states and promotes `` the political ambitions of the attorneys general by publicizing their actions.''

<HEAD>Mitsubishi Bank to List on New York Stock Exchange Next Week</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> next week will become the first Japanese bank to be listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and also will rank as the largest foreign company traded on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, published reports said Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION>, the world's fourth-largest bank, will be the ninth Japanese company to be listed on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. American investors will be allowed to trade more than two billion <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> shares, which initially will trade in the form of American depository receipts, the paper said. The move marks the first attempt by a Japanese bank to raise money in the American capital markets, which some Wall Street observers have predicted would be a growing trend, the paper said. The major Japanese banks are under pressure to raise $ 35 billion over the next four years in order to comply with new capital requirements that the world's leading central banks have set for international banks. The Times noted that Japanese banks had not been expected to resort to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to raise capital because they would have to meet <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> disclosure requirements as well as alter their accounting practices. But <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> has met the requirements. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the economic newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keizai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> said the listing would be made on Sept. 19. Established in 1919, <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> had assets totalling about $ 343.2 billion and net income of $ 1.15 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, according to a company report. The Tokyo-based bank has 245 domestic offices and 37 overseas affiliates in 24 countries. <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> and Japanese government officials were not available for comment Friday, which was a national holiday in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

 The stock market turned upward today, getting support from unexpectedly favorable economic news. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.08 to 2,670.97 in the first half hour of trading. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 699 up, 406 down and 568 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 78.68 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Activity was swollen by the quarterly `` triple witching hour,'' involving the last trading in a group of expiring options and futures on stock indexes. There had been concern that professional traders engaged in multiple strategies involving those contracts would depress the market with a barrage of sell orders for stocks. But at the opening the market absorbed whatever pressure resulted from the witching hour, with a big assist from the latest data on the state of the economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the producer price index of finished goods dropped 0.4 percent in August for its third consecutive monthly decline. And the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the nation's trade deficit narrowed to $ 7.58 billion in July from a downward-revised $ 8.01 billion in June. Gainers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION>, up -RRB- at 70 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, up \ at 36 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, up -RRB- at 48 ~, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, up -LRB- at 40 -RRB- The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose .31 to 191.26. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was up .16 at 381.10. On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 14.63 to 2,664.89, bringing its loss over the past two sessions to 42.37 points. Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 3 to 1 on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, with 387 up, 1,112 down and 459 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 149.25 million shares, down from 175.33 million in the previous session.

 Wholesale prices fell for the third consecutive month in August as a big drop in energy costs pushed inflation down by 0.4 percent, the government said today. The decline in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index followed a similar 0.4 percent plunge in July and a 0.1 percent dip in June. It was the first time wholesale prices have fallen for three consecutive months since early 1986. The August price moderation was even better than had been expected and provided further evidence to support arguments that inflation should be well under control in the second half of the year. In other good economics news today, the government reported that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit narrowed for the second straight month in July, falling to $ 7.58 billion, the smallest gap since December 1984. The 5.3 percent decline in the merchandise trade figure from June was a pleasant surprise to economists who had been fearing a sharp jump in the imbalance between exports and imports. In another report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.3 percent in August. It was the biggest increase since a 0.7 percent rise in April and was credited to a rebound in production at auto factories and a pickup in coal mining following a strike. The three-month string of declines in wholesale prices was particularly welcome because it came after a surge in prices earlier this year had triggered fears of a possible inflationary spiral. Wholesale prices were surging ahead at an annual rate of 9.4 percent through May. However, with the monthly declines since that time, wholesale inflation is now running at a much more moderate annual rate of 4.4 percent through the first eight months of the year. In 1988, wholesale prices rose 4 percent. A broadbased drop in energy costs was credited for the price decline in August. Gasoline prices plunged 12.1 percent, the third consecutive monthly decline. Prices of natural gas were also down, dropping 5 percent, while prices of home heating oil fell 2.1 percent. Food costs were not as well-controlled, posting a 0.3 percent increase as the costs of beef, dairy products and bakery goods accelerated. The price of eggs and pork rose in August after having fallen in July. Inflation, excluding the food and energy categories, was up 0.5 percent, reflecting in part higher prices for new cars. Many economists look to price increases of other goods as a better indicator of the underlying inflation rate because food and energy costs are more volatile from month to month. The June-July-August declines marked the first consecutive monthly drops in the Producer Price Index since a four-month period of falling wholesale prices from January through April in 1986. The improvement in August left the PPI at 113.3, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $ 100 in 1982 would have cost $ 113.30 in August. Unlike the other figures in the report, this one is not adjusted for normal seasonal variations. Economists had worried that higher food and energy costs were threatening to become imbedded in permanently higher inflation rates as workers demanded higher wage increases to make up for the ground lost to rising prices. That also was a concern at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, which began moving in March 1988 to push interest rates up in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s goal was to slow economic growth enough to allow inflation to moderate without pushing the country into a recession. In June of this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> switched course and began lowering interest rates because of signs the economy might be slowing too much. Many economists believe the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s delicate balancing act has worked and inflation will remain moderate in the second half of the year while the economic expansion, already the second longest on record, continues at a steady pace. Although the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has complained the central bank needs to do more to boost growth by lowering interest rates, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Penzer </PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said he did not expect any further credit easing in the immediate future. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> knows that much of the good news on inflation has come because energy prices and food prices have been falling, reversing their steep climb earlier in the year,'' he said. `` The inflation situation is better but the inflation problem has not been solved.'' The PPI tracks inflation at the wholesale level. The Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation at the retail level, will be released next Tuesday. So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual rate of 5.5 percent, more than a full percentage point higher than the 4.4 percent increases in both 1988 and 1987.

<HEAD>Stocks Minus Takeovers Equals ?</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If you took takeover mania out of the stock market, what would it cost investors? That's the tough calculation many analysts are trying to make right now, prompted by the latest tremors in the high-yield `` junk'' bond market that has provided the fuel for the buyout boom of the 1980s. The immediate issue the markets had to contend with last week was the problems of Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, faced with the challenge of reshuffling the coast-to-coast <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailing empire it had built with debt-financed acquisitions. Whatever the outcome of that particular case, analysts said, it set up a compressed demonstration of the broader psychological effects that might arise should big trouble develop in the takeover debt markets. Through the late 1980s, the market for `` junk'' debt has proved much more resilient than most of its critics and skeptics ever expected. It has weathered defaults and bankruptcy filings by some prominent bond issuers _ for example, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. It has ridden out a prolonged scandal at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the Wall Street firm that virtually invented the market for junk securities as financing tools, and has been its chief sponsor since. Still, some observers said events in the markets on Wednesday and Thursday, when <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s situation became the subject of intense scrutiny, unfolded as a sort of unscheduled `` fire drill.'' Stock prices fell for a good many companies that had been discussed as the next possible subjects for takeover bids, on the reasoning that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s experience might deter lenders and reduce the ranks of eager acquirers. So did the share prices of leading banks that also play a major role in takeover financing. Traders in all the markets watched warily for any sign of stepped-up redemptions by investors in mutual funds that specialize in junk bonds. Such redemptions could force interest rates higher for lower-quality securities and put other junk-bond investors in a bind. And onlookers with a longer-term perspective wondered at what level stocks would trade if market participants were no longer so eager to appraise them on their prospective buyout values. The Campeau situation apart, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nurock </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Paoli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, investment adviser, cites `` mounting evidence that viable deals are becoming more difficult to come by:'' _ Increasing numbers of past buyouts that have faltered; _ A shrinking number of companies that make sensible, or even fanciful, future targets; _ Higher interest costs to finance takeovers, stemming from reduced enthusiasm for junk bonds; _ The perception of greater difficulty in meeting takeover debt burdens in a period of soft or declining business profits. `` No one knows exactly how soon the next recession will strike, how deep it will inevitably be, or how many debt-laden corporations will ultimately default on their bonds,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stack </PERSON>, editor of the financial advisory service InvesTech. `` But with total corporate debt running at two times the level of the last recession, we can rest assured there'll be a few surprises.'' The stock market crash of 1987 was blamed in part on a scare that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would move to discourage takeover activity by changing the tax laws. But when stock prices tumbled, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> stepped in quickly to provide ample reserves of money. No credit crisis occurred, and within a matter of months the buyout mania was bulding up a new head of steam. Now, analysts are left to consider, how would the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> respond to a crunch in takeover debt?

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit narrowed for the second straight month in July, to $ 7.58 billion, the smallest gap in nearly five years, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported the July deficit represented a 5.3 percent decrease from a revised June deficit of $ 8.01 billion. In another report, the government said wholesale prices fell for the third consecutive month in August as a big drop in energy costs pushed inflation down by 0.4 percent. The decline in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index followed a similar 0.4 percent plunge in July and a 0.1 percent dip in June. It was the first time wholesale prices have fallen for three consecutive months since early 1986. The narrowing trade gap came from a 2.5 percent decrease in imports to $ 38.32 billion and a 1.8 percent decrease in exports to $ 30.74 billion. The trade deficit is the difference between imports and exports. The overall July deficit of $ 7.58 billion was the smallest since a $ 6.79 billion imbalance in December 1984. Economists had been expecting the deficit to widen as imports fueled by oil purchases rose while the higher dollar cut exports by making them more expensive overseas. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s foreign oil bill rose 2.9 percent to $ 4.3 billion in July. The amount of imported oil rose to 8.14 million barrels a day from 7.93 million in June and the price per barrel fell to $ 17.12 from $ 17.67 in June. The decrease in exports included such manufacturered goods as automboiles, machinery and materials while shipments of airplanes increased. In addition to oil, increased imports included clothing and footwear and general industrial machinery. Decreases included automobiles and trucks and electrical and specialized industrial machinery. Analysts had been looking for an imbalance of between $ 8.5 billion and $ 9 billion in July. But despite the July improvement, economists are predicting that the deficits will begin rising in the second half of the year as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> exports suffer from the rising value of the dollar. Analysts also say oil imports will continue to rise as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption increases and domestic production falls, becoming a major factor in producing a widening deficit in coming months. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an industry group, reported imported oil in July accounted for more than half of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> petroleum needs, the first time that has occurred in 12 years. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said `` the big surprise so far this year has been how good exports have done in the face of a rising dollar.'' He attributed that to `` very strong economies overseas ... with a big capital spending boom spilling over and helping <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. exports.'' `` But by late in the year, the higher dollar will be denting exports,'' <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> added. A higher dollar makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods more expensive in overseas markets. For the first half of the year, the deficit has been running at an annual rate of $ 108.6 billion, down 8.4 percent from last year's total merchandise trade deficit of $ 118.5 billion Despite the first-half improvement, many economists predict deficit growth in the last half of the year will make the total imbalance for 1989 about what it was in 1988. A worsening trade deficit means a double dose of bad news for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The administration based its predictions of healthy economic growth partly on a belief that exports would keep expanding. If this does not occur, the federal budget deficit will be higher because tax revenues will be lower. Additionally, higher trade deficits increase the pressure for protectionist trade measures to keep out imports, something the administration opposes. In other economic reports today: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.3 percent in August. It was the biggest increase since a 0.7 percent rise in April and was credited to a rebound in production at auto factories and a pickup in coal mining following a strike. _ The government said business inventories climbed 0.6 percent in July while business sales were falling 0.9 percent.

 The stock market showed some spotty gains today, getting support from unexpectedly favorable economic news. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.93 to 2,673.82 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street. But losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 597 up, 624 down and 578 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 106.29 million shares at midmorning. Activity was swollen by the quarterly `` triple witching hour,'' involving the last trading in a group of expiring options and futures on stock indexes. There had been concern that professional traders engaged in multiple strategies involving those contracts would depress the market with a barrage of sell orders for stocks. But at the opening the market absorbed whatever pressure resulted from the witching hour, with a big assist from the latest data on the state of the economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the producer price index of finished goods dropped 0.4 percent in August for its third consecutive monthly decline. And the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the nation's trade deficit narrowed to $ 7.58 billion in July from a downward-revised $ 8.01 billion in June.

<HEAD>From Slurpees to Bloomies, Debt Exacts Toll</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oh, the wages of debt. Consider <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The big Toronto-based retailer, scraping to make payments on a mountain of borrowed money, has been forced to put its crown jewel, the <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s chain, on the block. Then there's <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, purveyor of items ranging from milk to magazines to Slurpees slush-ice drinks. Revenue projections it issued when the founding family took the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> company private two years ago soured, and the price of $ 1.5 billion in <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> junk bonds plunged in recent weeks as investors fretted about the company's ability to pay its debt. Another recent victim of excessive borrowing is <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the hotel-casino company controlled by entertainer-turned-investor <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>. Resorts late last month stopped paying interest to bondholders after reporting a second-quarter loss and lower revenues. The chief culprit in all three cases was overestimated projections of what is known as cash flow, composed of profit plus bookkeeping charges such as depreciation. Many financial analysts regard cash flow as the most important measurement of a company's health The dealmakers expected the well-known retail operations of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> and the cash-cow casinos of Resorts to churn out enough money to keep up with huge debt-service payments. It did n't work out that way. The <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> and Resorts transactions were based on `` outrageously optimistic assumptions,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON>, chief economist at the economic consulting firm <ORGANIZATION> DRI-McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Just like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> they assumed growth would solve all problems,'' he said. `` Maybe these people are just guilty of a private-sector version of Reaganomics.'' A slump in the apparel industry hurt <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, which sold billions of dollars worth of junk bonds as it laid out more than $ 12 billion to buy <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> over the past few years. Some analysts believe <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> paid too much for the chains. At <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION>, 7-Eleven sales did n't meet expectations after the $ 4.9 billion leveraged buyout, despite a belief that convenience stores are steady cash generators. `` The profit margins are thin, and slight -LRB- revenue -RRB- deviations mean big hits to the bottom line,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, an industry analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> firm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. As for <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, he told bondholders in a recent letter that Resorts' cash flow was lower than expected, `` in part because we underestimated the time and capital expenditures it would take to turn around the company's operations to generate increased profits. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> sold $ 325 million in notes to buy Resorts from developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> last year, a debt that was piled on top of existing Resorts bonds totaling about $ 600 million. Resorts faces payments of more than $ 130 million this year in interest and principal, but its operations are not likely to generate that much, analysts say. In 1988, the company's cash flow was only $ 60.2 million. Resorts plans to release a restructuring plan to its debtholders soon. The troubles at these three companies once again highlight the huge amount of debt involved in corporate restructurings and takeovers. Some say they may lead to more caution by the banks and junk-bond financiers that bankroll these deals. `` People are becoming conditioned to these high debt levels,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>. However, she said, if one of the high-profile, highly leveraged deals of recent years goes bad, `` I think the confidence would be shaken very badly.'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said a consumer spending slowdown is causing the cash crunches at these and other consumer-industry companies. Consumer spending was strong a few years ago when these takeovers and buyouts were put together, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. But since then it has lagged, due partly to the 1986 federal tax revisions and concern about an economic slowdown. Such a reversal was inevitable, he said. `` You ca n't tell that to the kind of people that put these deals together. They simply extrapolate the recent past forever,'' he said. The problems at these highly leveraged companies, which developed despite a reasonably strong economy, are a sign of things to come, said <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. `` It is a tip of an iceberg, but I do n't think it's about to sink our economy,'' <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON> said.

 Trading in <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock remained halted today while the debt-crippled retail and property holding company worked out arrangements for a financial rescue. <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Kee </PERSON> said this morning the exchange had been advised that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> expected to make a statement shortly. The company Thursday had told the exchange it expected to have an announcement before the market opened Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> stock has been halted since Wednesday, pending an announcement from <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>. There was no indication from the company when any news might be forthcoming. The company's spokeswoman was not taking telephone calls. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has such a desperate need for cash to run its retail subsidiaries that it was forced to turn to a major stockholder for funds and was widely expected to cede control to the lender, <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. As part of a restructuring to cope with its debts, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> also decided to put its <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s department store chain up for sale <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> divisions, which operate numerous <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chains, have run very short of working capital. Without the $ 250 million loan from <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it appeared uncertain how <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> would be able to obtain credit so that its department stores could stock shelves adequately before the crucial Christmas season. Plus, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> needs an infusion of funds because it faces a loan payment deadline today. Disclosure of the severity of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s financial problems on Wednesday rocked the market for high-interest `` junk bonds'' that the company used to finance its buyouts of Allied and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and contributed to a selloff in the stock market. The junk bond market calmed on Thursday as trading slowed and participants awaited more word from <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>. Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which has a 24.5 stake in <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, was expected to gain a larger interest in <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for granting the loan. There has been speculation that Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON>, who owns nearly 54 percent of the Toronto-based company, would relinquish controlling interest. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> York </PERSON> entered an agreement in principle but various other parties _ <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors _ had to agree to the arrangements before the loan deal could be activated. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> issued its second-quarter financial results Thursday. It reported a loss of $ 124 million in the three months ended July 31 on revenue of $ 2.26 billion, compared to a loss of $ 109 million and revenue of $ 2.21 billion a year earlier.

 Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly mixed this morning on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in light trading amid an absence of significant changes in supply-and-demand factors. Soybeans were a little stronger, reflecting temporary supply tightness in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> caused by weather-related delays in shipping soybeans and soybean meal from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s main source of imported soybeans. `` They've had a tremendous amount of rain in some of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ports and that's created a situation where stuff that should be in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by now has n't gotten there yet,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s floor operations at the Board of Trade. Corn futures were mostly lower in light of forecasts for fair weather this weekend in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, which could speed up harvest activity. Wheat futures were a little stronger but trading activity was light in the absence of new export business. In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent to 2 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.86 -LCB- a bushel; corn futures were 2 \ cents lower to 1 \ cents higher with September at $ 2.37 -LCB- a bushel; oats were unchanged to -LCB- cent lower with December at $ 1.42 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents lower to 1 \ cents higher with September at $ Cattle futures were lower while pork futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .07 cent to .12 cent lower with October at 72.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .12 cent lower with October at 82.82 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .15 cent higher with October at 40.47 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .50 cent to .72 cent lower with February at 47.65 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled higher on Thursday, paced by the pork bellies, on reports that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was authorizing an additional $ 50 million in food aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> that would include pork products.

<HEAD>Dollar Surges Despite Intervention</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with central banks selling dollars
after dollar surges.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose sharply against all major currencies in active European trading Friday after the release of unexpectedly good <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade data. Gold traded in a tight range. The dollar gained sharply after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government reported that the nation's trade deficit narrowed to $ 7.58 billion in July from $ 8.01 billion in June. Economists had predicted a trade gap of around $ 9 billion. Though the data triggered an apparently concerted round of dollar-selling by central banks, the dollar edged up to three-month highs against a batch of currencies. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell nearly two cents on Friday to $ 1.5375, compared with $ 1.5582 late Thursday. Other late dollar rates, compared with morning rates in parentheses, compared with Thursday's late rates included: 2.0015 -LRB- 1.9758 -RRB- West German marks, up from 1.9705; 1.7305 -LRB- 1.7050 -RRB- Swiss francs, up from 1.7000; 6.7375 -LRB- 6.6660 -RRB- <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> francs, up from 6.6485; 2.2470 -LRB- 2.2250 -RRB- Dutch guilders, up from 2.2185; 1,432.50 -LRB- 1,417.20 -RRB- Italian lire, up from 1,413.00; and, 1.1895 -LRB- 1.1840 -RRB- Canadian dollars, up from 1.1849. The yen was not traded Friday in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, because markets were closed for Respect for the Aged Day, a national holiday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the dollar traded at 148.95, compared with 146.90 yen earlier Friday and 145.85 yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Thursday. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> currency dealers also said they detected the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> selling dollars to stem a surge after the economic reports were released. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> central bank never comments on intervention. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at $ 359.75 bid per troy ounce, down from Thursday's late price of $ 362.00. At mid-morning the city's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 359.65. Gold traded in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> at $ 359.70 bid per troy ounce, compared to $ 361.75 late Thursday. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s gold market was closed today because of the Chinese mid-autumn festival.

 <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> today accepted a $ 1.9 billion buyout offer from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a sweetened bid that topped a $ 1.8 billion offer from <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> increased its offer to $ 25 per share from its earlier $ 20 bid, <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said. Two companies controlled by <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, offered $ 23.16 a share in a surprise bid announced Tuesday <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> sealed its latest offer with a promise to promptly make a non-refundable $ 50 million deposit on <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, which encompasses the remainder of the old <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> movie studios. Under the terms of the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> would acquire all of <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding common stock for $ 25 per share and all its preferred stock for $ 18 per share, she said. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> until late Thursday, but then ended their talks. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> spokesman, said <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> had approached him about a buyout. `` He thought he had a deal, but then the transaction fell apart,'' <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> has spent 18-months trying to find a buyer satisfactory to <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s controlling shareholder <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, who has repeatedly sold and then repurchased many of the assets of the studios. The <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> deal provides for $ 1.33 billion to be paid for <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s common stock, $ 180 million for its preferred stocks, and $ 400 million in junk bond debt that <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> is assuming. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s offer valued <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> at about $ 1.8 billion, including the debt. A previous <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> deal would essentially split <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, with <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> paying about $ 600 million for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> studio and some other assets. It would have given the famous lion logo, the <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> operations, a library of 34 recent movies, and the <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters building in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> hills to <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>. But under the agreement announced today, there would be no repurchase of any <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s assets or any investments in <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> by former <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> shareholders. <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> owns 82 percent of <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s common stock and all but a tiny fraction of the preferred stock. However, <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Kerkorian-controlled company that operates a first-class airline and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> casinos, will purchase the <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters building in October for $ 43 million or its independently appraised value. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> will make about $ 26 million on that deal, the company said. In addition to the 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> studio, <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s newspaper, magazine and television enterprises on four continents are said to be worth more than $ 8 billion. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, who needs programming for his <ORGANIZATION> Sky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> satellite channels in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, had his eye on <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s huge <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> film libraries, which include the recent movies `` Rain Man,'' `` Betrayed'' and `` Baby Boom,'' as well as the `` Rocky,'' `` Pink Panther,'' and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> pictures. <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION>, also owns 43 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> based producer of television movies and miniseries such as `` Lonesome Dove.''

 <PERSON> Voss </PERSON> <PERSON> Boreta </PERSON> was a failed casino host between jobs when a broken 7-iron got him off the golf course and into the golf equipment business. Fifteen years later, he heads one of the country's biggest golf retailing outfits, one now poised to enter the lucrative Japanese market with a chain of 30 new stores. `` We were just going to have a little store,'' <PERSON> Boreta </PERSON> said of the humble beginnings of his <ORGANIZATION> Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Tennis empire. `` It's just kind of grown from there.'' From the 1,200-square-foot store tucked in the corner of an aging shopping center, <PERSON> Boreta </PERSON>'s discount golf outfit has grown into a multimillion-dollar operation with 42 franchises nationwide and 13 more ready to open this year. The chain, riding a nationwide boom in golf, did $ 47 million in business in 1988, $ 12 million of that at its main <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> store alone, ranking it near the top golf equipment retailers in the country. Not bad for a one-time avid golfer who does n't even play the game anymore. `` I have n't played since 1975,'' <PERSON> Boreta </PERSON> said recently in an interview in his cramped and cluttered office in the back of the original store. `` With the company growing like it has, I did n't have the time to devote to playing. Timing has been everything for the 52-year-old <PERSON> Boreta </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> nightclub operator who freely admits he stumbled into the golf game almost by accident. <PERSON> Boreta </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> in 1974 to become a casino host at the Tropicana Hotel. But, after three days, he decided the job did n't suit him and spent his days playing golf while deciding his future plans `` One day I broke a 7-iron and there was no place to fix it,'' <PERSON> Boreta </PERSON> recalled. `` I sent it to a friend who ran a golf shop in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and told him there was a great opportunity here. He said, ` Why do n't you do it?''' <PERSON> Boreta </PERSON> took the advice and opened the original <ORGANIZATION> Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> store in a shopping center near the Las Vegas airport. The store grossed $ 275,000 the first year and <PERSON> Boreta </PERSON> was off and running. It was a tenative step into mail order two years later, however, that put the company name on the national map and on its way to being a major player in the golf equipment business. `` We put a little ad in <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- magazine -RRB- that people had to call with their own dime,'' <PERSON> Boreta </PERSON> said. `` When they called, we told them we'd send them a catalog when we did n't even have one put together yet. But the next thing you know, here comes a couple of orders in.'' Ironically, one of the country's largest golf mail-order outlets and franchisers, <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bob </ORGANIZATION>'s, also got its start in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. At the same time the discount golf shops were beginning to expand, golf club manufacturers were broadening their club lines to tap the beginners market. `` These manufacturers got smart and started making game improvement clubs,'' <PERSON> Boreta </PERSON> said. `` That is what really started the golfing boom. Now, you can take a non-player and after one lesson he can hit the ball in the air and in the general direction he or she wants it.'' Those clubs have been constantly improving and Japanese companies have taken the lead in marrying boron and graphite shafts that are stronger, longer and more accurate than their steel predecessors. Partly as a result, according to the Florida-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, some 23.4 million people played at least one round of golf last year, up from 15.1 million in 1980. More than 320 new courses have opened since 1987 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, bringing the total to more than 13,000. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, there are an estimated 12 million golfers and 1,600 courses. `` I've never seen anything like the last few years as far as people playing the game,'' <PERSON> Boreta </PERSON> said. `` It seems like just in the last two years it has really taken off.'' <PERSON> Boreta </PERSON> sees an even bigger opportunity in the lucrative Japanese market and his chain has signed an agreement with a Japanese company to open a store in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> next month followed by 29 others for other locations in the golf-crazy country.'' `` We get a tremendous amount of Japanese who come here and buy three or four sets of clubs and take them home to sell to friends,'' <PERSON> Boreta </PERSON> said. `` We figured we'd take the operation to them.''

<HEAD>Cable Operator to Debut Independent Station</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY APPELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An independent television station being launched by a local cable operator could signal the opening of a new battleground between cable and free television. WGRC-TV, scheduled to debut Thursday in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, will air syndicated network reruns, sports, movies, and locally produced children's shows. The station hopes eventually to debut a local newscast and is negotiating to broadcast some <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> games. `` It's an expansion of cable's promise, which is to deliver programming choice to subscribers,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Alter </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` It's providing expanded, enriched service that is very localized.'' The station will be programmed and operated by local cable operator <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cablevision </ORGANIZATION>, which currently reaches 62 percent of the area's households with televisions. The <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> market has one non-cable independent station. Alter predicted that if the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> station is successful, independent stations will be launched in other markets. Some cable operators have already begun airing local news shows, he said. <PERSON> Lana </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, marketing vice president for the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION>, reacted with dismay to the advent of the new station and the possibility of others like it. `` This threatens our ability to serve the community free of charge,'' she said. `` It's a fear that we have had for a long time.'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said that cable stations, with the added revenue from subscriber charges as well as advertising, can outbid independent television stations for syndicated programming. Eventually, she said, viewers could end up having to pay to see the same programs they would have gotten for free. `` We're seeing it happening in sports,'' she said. `` That same phenomenon is now happening in all programming.'' The <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> cable station currently carries locally originated programming like fishing shows. <ORGANIZATION> GRC </ORGANIZATION> President and chief executive officer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiaino </PERSON> said the idea for the station originated in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, but that <ORGANIZATION> GRC </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, will be `` watching what we do with interest.'' The station was created to increase advertising revenues and subscribers and in response to new syndication laws, <PERSON> Chiaino </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> may sell advertising on the station in packages with its other products, including Sports Illustrated and Time magazines, according to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murtagh </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Seltel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a sales representative for the station.

<HEAD>Corn Futures Drop On Lack Of Expected Soviet Purchase</HEAD>

 Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in a quiet session marked by a lack of significant supply-and-demand developments. The corn market weakened late in the session when confirmation of a rumored Soviet corn purchase failed to materialize. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s floor operations at the exchange, said the speculation was premature. `` I think the Russians are going to be significant buyers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn ... but not at this time,'' he said. `` You buy during the harvest, not before the harvest. You do n't get the lowest prices right now.'' Corn harvesting has begun but wo n't get into full swing for another week, he said. The peak of the soybean harvest is still two weeks away. Forecasts for clear dry weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> this weekend also weighed on the markets. Analysts said those conditions would help the crops mature and speed up the early harvest activity. At the close, wheat futures were 1 -RCB- cents lower to 3 cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.88 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 2 \ cents lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.35 a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent lower to 2 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 1.37 a bushel; and soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents lower to -RCB- cent higher with September at $ 5.82 a bushel

True or not, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>'s view is rejected by employees who will soon be asked by company negotiators to grant a third consecutive round of contract concessions. `` I do n't believe it, not one bit of it,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 56, of <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, a veteran of nearly 30 years with the company. `` They're cutthroats. <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> says the company's ability to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> union could determine whether <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> rises from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization or is liquidated under Chapter 7. That in turn will influence the economy of this steelmaking area of western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, into which <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> pumps about $ 200 million annually as one of the largest employers with 2,600 workers. `` We lost money in the best steel market in a decade and have the dubious distinction of being the only company to say that. That gives you an idea of the destitute situation here,'' <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> said in a recent interview in his spartan office. The nation's 16th-largest steelmaker has been trying to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws since April 17, 1987, listing $ 740 million in debts it could not pay. <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>'s plan for saving the company begins with lowering employment costs by cutting direct cash outlays and erasing what he calls wasteful and inefficient work rules. New equipment would come later. `` A contract has to be clearly in sight by Thanksgiving and ratified by no later than January or February or we will face a number of things,'' he said. By early next year, <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> said, the company could run out of cash and be forced to delay bill payments, echoing events that forced it into bankruptcy court two years ago. `` We're that close if the market stays soft, and I think it will get softer,'' said <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>, a 14-year veteran of <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> management who left in 1982 and returned in late April as chief operating officer. It was not clear when contract talks would begin. <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> owes $ 70 million to pension plans for 3,500 retirees, and total labor costs are around $ 28 per hour, among the highest even for major producers, said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Smalley </PERSON>, vice president of industrial relations. The company's steel and steel-related segments lost $ 16.3 million on sales of $ 263.1 million during the first half of this year, according to the court-appointed trustee serving as chief executive. The company's non-steel operations _ copper and brass fabrication at <ORGANIZATION> Mueller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and coal mining at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and gold mining at <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ continue to offset much of steel's losses and helped limit the first-half consolidated net loss to $ 2.5 million `` How can they not be making money?'' said <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> veteran Bud Pears. `` Guys are working overtime out their ears. We're producing steel like crazy'' Workers say there are plenty of signs that the company is making money <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> expanded its workforce to 2,600 by early this year to meet demand for its products. Average shipments climbed from 70,000 tons per month in 1987 to 89,000 last year and were running at 92,000 tons per month through the first half of this year. The steel industry is enjoying its third year of recovery. And <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> financier accused of sucking <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> dry of cash after acquiring control, still owns the stock but has been stripped of his authority. `` People say, ` Who are you kidding?''' <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> said, acknowledging the skepticism. `` I say even in the good days, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> was one of the laggards.'' A landlocked blast furnace, for which iron ore, coke and limestone must be delivered by rail and truck instead of cheaper barge transportation, is one of the disadvantages that <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> calls congenital defects. `` Near-Neanderthal tools,'' an unwieldy product mix and work rules that inflate production costs also work against the company, he said. `` The market is weaker, and prices are softening, and the loss rate is accelerating,'' <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> said. `` We're losing money, dissipating assets.'' Management sees another crunch coming, and warns employees in a series of red-lettered pamphlets that without large sums of money to buy new equipment, lower labor costs may be the only hope of avoiding Chapter 7 liquidation. `` Not as far as I'm concerned,'' said <PERSON> Pears </PERSON>. `` I do n't care what they do. I'm just down there working. When it's over, it's over. I'll go find the next job.'' Pears and others say they're particularly bitter about an employee stock ownership plan that the employees say is overdue in repaying their investments. `` I've got $ 16,000 in it, and I'll never see it,'' said Pears. `` So you tell me how you'd feel towards the place. Bottom line.'' Even those workers who are convinced <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> is in trouble do n't sound sympathetic. `` As far as concessions are concerned, I do believe they need them. But as far as I'm concerned they're not going to get them,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanovich </PERSON> of <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>. `` I gave and gave. There's no more to give.''

 The stock market was mixed today, showing few ill effects from the quarterly `` triple witching hour.'' Heavy activity at the opening and again at the close was prompted by the witching hour, involving the last trading in a group of expiring options and futures on stock indexes. There had been concern that professional traders engaged in multiple strategies involving those contracts would depress the market with a barrage of sell orders for stocks. But the market got a boost from the latest data on the state of the economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the producer price index of finished goods dropped 0.4 percent in August for its third consecutive monthly decline. And the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the nation's trade deficit narrowed to $ 7.58 billion in July from a downward-revised $ 8.01 billion in June.

<HEAD>Hoylake Gets More Time for Its BAT Bid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s takeover watchdog, recognizing the increasingly international nature of the bidding process, on Friday allowed <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> more time for its $ 21 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In an unprecedented step, the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, which imposes a complex timetable on takeovers in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, said it would allow <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> to rebid for BAT after it obtains approval from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> state insurance regulators to change the ownership of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> It said delays by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulatory process meant BAT shareholders were not able to properly consider the offer of 878 pence, or $ 13.52, a share in securities. The purchase would be the world's second-largest takeover after <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 24.5 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. BAT, a British conglomerate with interests in tobacco, retailing, financial services and paper, said it would take the ruling to the panel's appeal committee. That stops the current <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> takeover clock until a final decision is reached. BAT's shares soared on the developments. They rose 18 pence, or 28 cents, to 819 pence, or $ 12.61, a share on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> still must win the green light from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulators. In addition, <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> probably would have to increase its offer or include some cash to lure BAT's shareholders, analysts have said. BAT attacked the panel's decision, saying it undermined the watchdog's goal of protecting targets from `` an indefinite and damaging siege.'' <PERSON> Hoylake </PERSON> said it welcomed the news and that Anglo-French financier Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, who is spearheading the bidding group, would depart immediately for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` to establish the best way to continue to expedite the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulatory approval.'' <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> is to meet with <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Bebear </PERSON>, chairman of the French insurance giant <ORGANIZATION> Axa-Midi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurances </ORGANIZATION>, which wants to buy Farmers under <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed break-up of BAT. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> says it wants to sell off all of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s non-tobacco assets. Other investors in <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> include <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> merchant banker <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> and Australian entrepreneur <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>. Concern has grown in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> over interference from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulators and courts in takeover fights involving British companies with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests. South African-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>'s bid for the British mining group <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> failed earlier this year because the offer expired under British takeover rules while it was being reviewed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal court. Under the panel's rules, <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION>, which launched its offer for BAT on July 11, had had until Oct. 7 to obtain a majority stake in BAT. If it had failed, it would have had to wait for a year to bid again. The panel, after holding a full hearing on Wednesday, said Friday morning that it would allow <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> 21 days to complete its bid for BAT after it wins <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approval. The panel has altered its timetable in the past under varying conditions, but it has never before granted an extension because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulatory holdups, said a panel official, who asked not to be identified, in accordance with British practice. Explaining its decision, the panel said the delay caused by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proceedings meant BAT shareholders were not getting a real opportunity to consider the offer on its merits. `` One of the principal objects of the code is to enable the shareholders in the target company to have an opportunity to consider an offer for their company on its merits on an informed basis in an orderly and limited time scale,'' the panel said. BAT Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said BAT did n't want to deprive its shareholders of the opportunity to consider a bid. `` We are simply seeking to remove the uncertainty, and also the damage which a prolonged siege would inflict on the company,'' <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said. BAT said the panel's `` wrong decision'' allows <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> to free itself from regulatory difficulties which are `` entirely of its own making.''

<HEAD>Chris-Craft Appealing Ruling In Time-Warner Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it was appealing a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> judge's ruling that the company, a major shareholder in <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has no power to veto the merger between <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The ruling last week by <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the terms of a class of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> preferred stock held by a <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, did not entitle Chris-Craft to vote on the merger of the two media giants. A Chris-Craft attorney, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crompton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said the company was asking the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn the ruling on the ground <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> had inaccurately interpreted the terms of the stock. A three-judge panel of the state's highest court was to hear arguments in the case on Oct. 18 in <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> ruled in response to a request for a declaration of Chris-Craft's rights by <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, who want the issue resolved so they can consummate their merger. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> completed a $ 14 billion tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> in July, and then changed its name to <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The companies hope to finalize their merger later this year. A decision by <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, later upheld by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, threw out a challenge to the merger by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which had sought to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 12 billion. In his latest decision, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said that under the terms of the stock Chris-Craft does not `` possess a veto over every merger in which its interests would be adversely affected.'' Chris-Craft contended it had a right to vote on the merger because its preferred <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shares can be converted into preferred <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shares. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> have been feuding since Chris-Craft helped <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> fend off an unwanted takeover bid from publisher <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> in 1984.

 The dollar fell sharply Friday in panicky domestic dealings characterized by wild rumors and price swings, erasing gains posted in earlier foreign trading. Gold prices were mixed. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold bullion for current delivery jumped to $ 363.90 a troy ounce, up $ 3.40 from Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid for gold of $ 362.50 an ounce, up from $ 359.35. The dollar rallied sharply in foreign trading, climbing above the benchmark 2.00 level against the West German mark following a better-than-expected report on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the deficit narrowed to a seasonally adjusted $ 7.58 billion in August from a revised $ 8.01 billion in July, shocking a market that had expected a $ 9 billion shortfall. But traders at home said the euphoria was short-lived. By mid-afternoon, the market was hit with a string of outrageous rumors ranging from the assassination of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to the failure of <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` With the slew of rumors, the dollar came screaming off,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrie </PERSON>, a vice president at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. `` It was scary.'' Within an hour, the dollar plunged 6 pfennigs against the West German mark. `` That's a pretty dramatic move,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` We were sitting at 2.00 marks _ it was a wild and crazy day.'' One by one the rumors were denied, which helped pick the dollar up from its lows. But <PERSON> Lawrie </PERSON> said many investors had been `` scared enough today to step out of their positions and take a breather.'' The central banks joined forces to sell dollars throughout the day, and ultimately traders welcomed the move for smoothing out the dollar's decline. The session's extreme volatility has forced technicians to revise their trading ranges. `` It will be a while before we test 2.00 marks again,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Fundamentally, dealers noted that the trade report showed a decline in both imports and exports, perhaps pointing to a weakening economy and lower interest rates, which do not bode well for the dollar. The yen was not traded Friday in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where markets were closed for a holiday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 148.65 yen, compared with Thursday's closing price in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> of 145.85 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 146.35 yen, down from 146.85 yen on Thursday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.5390 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.5582 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.5660 to buy one pound, more expensive than Thursday's $ 1.5540. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 1.9660 West German marks, down from 1.9750; 1.6945 Swiss francs, down from 1.7040; 6.6295 French francs, down from 6.6615; 1,410.50 Italian lire, down from 1,418.50, and 1.1848 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1850. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 2.0005 West German marks, up from 1.9705; 1.7260 Swiss francs, up from 1.7000; 6.7430 French francs, up from 6.6485; 2.2490 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2185; 1,433.00 Italian lire, up from 1,413.00; and 1.1880 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1849. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid of $ 356.25 a troy ounce, compared with late Thursday's $ 362.00. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold fell to $ 356.00 an ounce from $ 361.75 late Thursday. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s gold market was closed Friday for the Chinese mid-autumn festival. Silver prices were mixed. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for current delivery rose to $ 5.084 an ounce from $ 5.055 Thursday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the metal was trading at a late bid of $ 5.03 a troy ounce, compared with Thursday's $ 5.12.

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> on Friday offered to match the $ 6.75 billion buyout offer that <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to with its pilots and managers if that deal collapsed and said he would demand no labor concessions _ a key point for unions. Although he noted his `` clear competitive disadvantage,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he too would pay $ 300 a share for the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Late Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> approved an offer in which employees would own 75 percent of the company, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> would own 15 percent and management 10 percent. The pilots' offer requires labor and wage concessions and is opposed by the union representing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> machinists. Flight attendants are still weighing the deal. `` The magnitude of the labor concessions -LRB- the pilot-management group -RRB- contemplates is significant,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board. `` Any bidder lacking those concessions is at a clear competitive disadvantage.'' The pilot-management group plan includes a seven-year, no-strike guarantee by the pilots and other cost-cutting labor concessions, including lowered wages and benefits. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> declined comment on <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' letter Friday. But <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, an airline industry analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the latest volley by <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> suggests he believes a bid of more than $ 300 per share would be too much to pay. `` He recognized that he ca n't top a bid by employees,'' said <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>. `` But if the bid falls apart, then he'll be there to buy the company.'' A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilots, who have been attempting to buy the airline since 1987, said he feels certain the deal will be completed. `` We have proven our tenaciousness,'' said <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, representing 7,000 pilots. `` We are not going to relax until this company becomes an employee-owned airline.'' The pilot-management coalition still faces several hurdles, including a decision by the airline's machinists to oppose the buyout. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, representing 25,000 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> employees, `` has no intention of participating in the proposal in its present form,'' <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, president of the union's District 141, said in a letter released Thursday. The machinists believe the deal would leave <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> heavily in debt and could threaten the job security of union members. Flight attendants have begun talks toward possible participation in the buyout, said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants, representing more than 12,700 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> workers. In trading Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> fell 75 cents a share to $ 279.75. If a settlement were reached, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> would top <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, with 11,000 employees, as the country's largest employee-owned corporation. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investor who started the takeover battle six weeks ago and previously bid $ 6.19 billion, or $ 275 a share for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, would not disclose his current stake in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fingeroth </PERSON>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said Friday that the course he has chosen to follow `` may provide us with a higher probability of success in acquiring <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> than attempting to bid against the coalition that has been arrayed against us.'' The pilot-management agreement was announced Thursday after the employee group made a final presentation to a special committee of the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> board and revealed the financing for its bid. The deal still requires the approval of shareholders and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, which is not expected to raise major objections. With inclusion of financing costs, the deal would total $ 7.2 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> have committed $ 3 billion to finance the buyout and will obtain commitments for an additional $ 4.2 billion, officials said.

<HEAD>Rumors Wrench Gold Market, Which Ends Higher</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Gold futures prices made strong gains Friday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after being wrenched back from three-year lows by unfounded rumors that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been shot and that a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank was near collapse `` From what we can see it was purely rumor-driven,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonat </PERSON>, a metals trader with <ORGANIZATION> Deak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. On other markets, energy futures advanced; grains and soybeans were mixed; and livestock and meat futures were mixed Gold futures settled $ 3.40 higher across the board with the contract for delivery in October at $ 365.20 a troy ounce. Silver futures were 2.7 cents to 2.9 cents higher with September at $ 5.084 a troy ounce. Analysts said the moves in the metal markets were mainly reactions to the dollar, which strengthened early in the day following positive reports on inflation and the trade deficit, then collapsed in the afternoon amid the wild rumors. `` We had a complete reversal,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, a metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The dollar went through what was described as a free fall.'' The market gave more credence to the talk of an impending bank collapse than to the rumors about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, analysts said, because the financial markets already were jittery about the credit troubles of retailing giant <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. For the gold market, which has been weakening gradually for months, the turnaround could mark a turning point, <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON> said `` New lows were made and then you came up with a higher close on the day. That could be considered a key reversal,'' signalling the start of a major bull move, he said. Energy futures also rallied late in the session on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, more than offsetting the significant technically inspired losses that had accrued earlier in the week. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents to 26 cents higher with October at $ 19.96 a barrel; heating oil was .74 cent to .91 cent higher with October at 55.95 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .74 cent to .90 cent higher with October at 57.50 cents a gallon. Grain and soybean futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in a quiet session marked by a lack of significant supply-and-demand developments. The corn market weakened late in the session when confirmation of a rumored Soviet corn purchase failed to materialize. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s floor operations at the exchange, said the speculation was premature. `` I think the Russians are going to be significant buyers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn ... but not at this time,'' he said. `` You buy during the harvest, not before the harvest. You do n't get the lowest prices right now.'' Corn harvesting has begun but wo n't get into full swing for another week, he said. The peak of the soybean harvest is still two weeks away. Wheat futures settled 2 cents lower to 3 cents higher with September at $ 3.88 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 2 \ cents lower to 1 \ cents higher with September at $ 2.35 a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent lower to 2 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 1.37 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with September at $ 5.83 -LCB- a Livestock and meat futures were mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in a day of profit-taking following Thursday's fierce rally, which was prompted by proposals to include pork products in a food-aid package to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Live cattle futures settled .07 cent lower to .45 cent higher with October at 72.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .05 cent higher with September at 83.37 cents a pound; hogs were .32 cent to .55 cent higher with October at 40.97 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .15 cent lower to .05 cent higher with February at 48.25 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Minority Broadcast Rules Need Congressional Protection, Senate Panel
Told</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> rules that have increased minority and female ownership of radio and TV stations need congressional protection from recent attacks in the courts and from the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> itself, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel was told Friday. Minority and women broadcasters said they had made great strides in gaining licenses during the 1970s when the rules were established to ease their entry, but that progress slowed under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration during the early 1980s. The Republican-led FCC `` began a concerted attack upon minority ownership polices. ... Eight years after the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration took office there are only 160 radio stations and 15 television stations'' owned by blacks, which represents 2 percent of all stations, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1988 ordered the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to stop reconsidering the minority and female preference rules, but the rules suffered a major blow earlier this year when a court declared part of them unconstitutional. Witnesses urged the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> communications subcommittee to write the FCC rules into law to protect them from constitutional attack. Subcommittee chairman Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, said his staff was preparing such legislation. `` In the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> got on the wrong track,'' Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, the full <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said in written testimony. `` While it used fancy words and phrases to claim these policies were unconstitutional, we knew all along it simply did not support the spirit of these policies.'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittee this week included a provision in an <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> appropriations bill that would maintain the rules. The FCC rules, first adopted in 1973, give preference to minorities and women in license renewal proceedings. In 1978, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> added an important provision that gives a tax break to station owners who sell to minorities. `` If the tax certificate policy is ever eliminated, minority purchasers might as well disconnect their telephones, because they will never get another call to purchase a station,'' <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION> said. Another provision added in 1978 was the distress sale policy that allows broadcasters facing license revocation to sell quickly to minority groups for 75 percent of the fair value of the station and end further FCC action against them. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> appeals court in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this year struck down the policy, saying the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> had not demonstrated there was a link between minority ownership and a proliferation of minority programming and that the agency had not demonstrated there is a history of racial discrimination in broadcasting requiring the preference policies. Less than a month later, however, another three-judge panel of the court upheld the constitutionality of the female and minority preference provisions. The lone witness testifying against codifying the rules was <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shurberg </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, broadcaster who won the appeals court test. <PERSON> Shurberg </PERSON>, who opposed a minority broadcaster who had won station <ORGANIZATION> WHCT-TV </ORGANIZATION> in a distress sale, cited the court's view that without firm evidence that would-be minority owners are subject to discrimination when they try to buy stations, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should not intervene. He said minorities do n't necessarily program for the benefit of minorities once they've achieved their licenses, particularly if the station is located in a market made up of primarily non-minority listeners. `` Diversity is driven by the marketplace,'' <PERSON> Shurberg </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ralston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's leading maker of dog and cat food, is going into the baby food business. <ORGANIZATION> Ralston </ORGANIZATION> officials said Friday they had reached a tentative agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to buy its <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> baby food business, which has annual sales of about $ 150 million. <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> is the second largest maker of baby food in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, far behind <ORGANIZATION> Gerber </ORGANIZATION> in the $ 1 billion baby food industry. The deal does not include <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> gum, which is produced by another company. `` Because there are a great many similarities between how some of our products and Beech-Nut products are sold and marketed, we believe this deal offers us some tremendous opportunities,'' said <PERSON> Ralston </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Up After Uneven Session</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices gyrated Friday before finishing higher in a session dominated by mixed economic news and rumors. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond was up in early trading, down slightly at midday, and back up by the close. It finished 15-32 point higher, or nearly $ 4.70 per $ 1,000 face amount. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, fell to 8.07 percent from 8.12 percent late Thursday. Analysts said bonds got their first boost from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index, which showed wholesale prices falling in August for the third consecutive month, down 0.4 percent. But bonds dropped later when traders noted that excluding the volatile food and energy sector, inflation actually rose 0.5 percent. Inflation is the enemy of bonds, which pay fixed interest. The bond market reacted uncertainly to long-awaited reports on trade and factory output. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit narrowed in July to $ 7.58 billion, the smallest gap since December 1984. Output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.3 percent in August. Several rumors of bad news also affected the market. Financial markets are susceptible to rumors because many people trade on them without taking time to see if they are true. By the end of the day traders decided that on balance the news was good. `` What the market got was kind of an information overload,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandross </PERSON>, economist for <ORGANIZATION> Lloyds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Overall the economic numbers confirmed we're not in a recession and that growth is continuing at a respectable rate in the third quarter.'' Trading remained thin in the junk bond market, where lower-grade issues have been hit by the cash crunch at the <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> units of Canadian retailing giant <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, prices of short-term governments were up about 1-32 point, intermediate maturities were up 3-32 to 3-16 point and long-term issues were up close to -LCB- point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 1.89 to 1,183.49. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, gained 1.06 to 331.79. In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds fell 3-32 point to 92 11-16. The average yield to maturity rose to 7.36 percent from 7.35 percent late Thursday. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills fell to 7.76 percent as the discount fell 5 basis points to 7.52 percent. Yields on six-month bills fell to 7.94 percent as the discount fell 2 basis points to 7.54 percent. Yields on one-year bills were unchanged at 7.98 percent as the discount remained at 7.45 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 9 1-16 percent, up from 8 ~ percent late Thursday

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it would modify its DC-10 jetliners to ensure safe landings even if all three hydraulic systems fail. The modifications, developed in response to a DC-10 crash that killed 112 people in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, last July, were greeted warmly by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Busey </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` The system design changes proposed by <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> ... are a solid step forward in assuring there will be no repeat of the July 19 accident,'' <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> said in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` Once these design changes are in place, they will raise the already high safety standards required of the DC-10 and, in effect, make a good airplane even better.'' <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, manufactured the DC-10s, which have been replaced by the newer but similar MD-11s. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Elayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendel </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that the company had yet to decide whether to make the same modifications to its MD-11s. `` We are going to look at the MD-11 and evaluate it and we'll do what is appropriate there,'' she said, `` and of course we will comply with whatever directives the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> issues.'' The three hydraulic systems on the planes are designed to be redundant, that is to operate independently and to back each other up in case one fails. In the July crash, the tail engine on the DC-10 disintegrated, knocking out all three hydraulic systems _ an event a <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> release Friday called `` one in a billion.'' The pilot lost virtually all control of the plane, which exploded in flames in a corn field near the runway. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> who headed the investigation of the crash, said the following modifications will be made: _ An electrically operated shutoff valve will be installed in the supply line and a check valve in the return line of the No 3 hydraulic system. _ A check valve will be installed in the No 3 hydraulic reservoir. _ A cockpit light will be added to alert the crew if the shutoff valve is activated The new fast-acting shutoff valve, located just behind the back wall of the cabin, will close automatically and the cockpit light will come on if a sensor detects hydraulic fluid dropping below a preset level in the reservoir. Even if all three hydraulic systems are affected by severe damage to the tail section, as happened in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the valve will stop fluid flow through the No. 3 system, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said. With adequate hydraulic pressure thus preserved in that system, the crew should have enough control to fly the plane to a safe landing.

 Buyers in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> can bid on <ORGANIZATION> Hereford </ORGANIZATION> cattle being sold here Sunday in what is believed to be the first international satellite auction of registered beef cattle, organizers said Friday. The first international satellite sale of registered beef cattle will be beamed throughout the world and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to television viewers who call in their bids to a telephone bank at the auction here. `` We feel like this is going to be the way to go in the future,'' said <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> representative of the American <ORGANIZATION> Hereford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> who proposed the satellite auction after attending a similar `` sky bridge'' between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Australian wheat farmers last January. Cattle ranchers in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can buy from 26 consignments of registered <ORGANIZATION> Hereford </ORGANIZATION> bulls, heifers, semen and embryos by telephone and save the costs of traveling to the auction, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. `` The price of an airline ticket would buy enough semen to inseminate 20 cows,'' said <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> rancher and co-chairman of the event. `` This way, a breeder in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> can make a $ 25 telephone call and save the cost of a ticket.'' `` You no longer have to be in the heat of cattle country to have a significant cattle sale,'' said <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hegreberg </PERSON>, program coordinator and <ORGANIZATION> Spokane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> representative. Sixty head of cattle from 11 states will be auctioned, as well as frozen embryos and semen, said <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>. Animals are expected to fetch $ 2,500 to $ 20,000 apiece. Videotapes of animals not at the auction, or of bulls and cows from which semen or embryos were taken, also will be shown, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> and a veterinary corporation gave the pilot project grants of more than $ 12,000, <PERSON> Hegreberg </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> analysis of the event will largely determine whether similar grant money is available in the future, <PERSON> Hegreberg </PERSON> said, noting skepticism among some agriculture interests. The satellite auction may help to cut through some regulations, restrictions and politics surrounding livestock imports and exports, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. Logistics of transporting the sale animals and other items will be worked out between the sales manager and buyers, he said. `` We're very excited about it and we hope it will become an annual event,'' said <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>.

 A state judge on Friday refused to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicate </ORGANIZATION> from pulling 26 comics and other features from the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> until the newspaper's lawsuit against its main competitor is resolved. Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> did not prove it would be irreparably harmed if it lost the features as a result of a deal between <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` They did n't prove to the judge's satisfaction that irreparable harm would take place and at the time of trial the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> would likely prevail,'' <PERSON> West </PERSON> said. The order took effect immediately, but <PERSON> West </PERSON> said he would not hold the <ORGANIZATION> Times-Herald </ORGANIZATION> in contempt if some <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> features continue to appear in the newspaper for a few days. The judge said he realized some of the features were printed ahead of time and could n't immediately be withdrawn. A Universal Press official testified that The Morning News has agreed to run all 26 of the comics and columns in question, and <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said some of them will appear beginning Monday. `` We're very pleased with the decision, and now we can move on,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. She declined further comment. <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> Editor <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bode </PERSON> said the newspaper will continue to pursue its antitrust case. `` We will fully and vigorously peruse all available legal remedies in an attempt to recover these features and all damages to the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bode </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. `` We will continue our suit and continue to fight for fair competition in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> with all our energies,'' he said. The judge issued his decision after attorneys asked him to indicate how he was leaning. He said that although he was ruling from the bench, he had given much thought to the decision. `` No one thinks a one-newspaper town is advantageous. I'm taking this very seriously,'' he said. He asked attorneys to agree on a trial date later this year for the antitrust suit and set a Nov. 6 hearing to decide whether the case should be transferred back to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. `` I think the evidence overwhelmingly showed that this was a fantastic business opportunity for The Morning News,'' the paper's attorney, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, said after the ruling The <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> suit accuses <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> of unfairly increasing its influence in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> media market. Belo last month formed a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to develop some of the syndicate's features for television. As part of the agreement, <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> _ which also owns <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' top-rated TV station, <ORGANIZATION> WFAA </ORGANIZATION> _ acquired exclusive rights to <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> material Universal pulled its features from the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, but the newspaper regained the right to print them under a temporary restraining order issued by West on Sept. 5.

<TEXT>
 Wholesale prices declined for the third straight month in August as a big new drop in energy costs helped keep inflation in check, the government said Friday in releasing a string of generally upbeat economic reports. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its Producer Price Index, which measures costs one step short of the retail level, plunged 0.4 percent last month, matching the decline in July. The index had been down 0.1 percent in June. It was the first time that wholesale prices had fallen for three consecutive months since a four-month drop from January through April, 1986. Adding to the good economic news, the government said that production at the nation's factories rose in August at its fastest clip in four months while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit in July fell to its lowest level in nearly five years. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the various government reports showed that the longest peacetime economic expansion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history was moving forward, continuing `` to produce jobs for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' Private analysts were generally enthusiastic as well, saying the reports represented a victory for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which has been trying at the same time to keep the recovery alive and restrain inflationary pressures. `` From the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s viewpoint, all the news looks very good,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief financial economist at <LOCATION> DRI-McGraw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` The only danger is that <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> officials might sprain an elbow patting themselves on the back.'' While the trade report sent the dollar surging on foreign currency markets, the stock market appeared unimpressed by the favorable economic news, with the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average rising 9.69 for the day. Prices on the bond market fell as traders focused not on the overall 0.4 percent decline in wholesale-price inflation but in a 0.5 percent rise in inflation excluding the volatile energy and food categories. This inflation figure is considered a better indication of the economy's underlying inflation rate. While some private economists said the non-food, non-energy inflation increase was worrisome, other analysts maintained that the figure has had temporary monthly surges in the past without signalling that the overall inflation rate was getting out of hand. `` Inflation is falling, not running away or accelerating as many people have feared,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> A. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our forecasts indicate that inflation will continue to decline.'' The three-month string of declines in wholesale prices was particularly welcome because it came after a surge in prices earlier this year triggered by higher world oil costs and the lingering effects on food supplies from last summer's drought. Wholesale prices were racing ahead at an annual rate of 9.4 percent from January through May. But, with prices falling since June, the annualized inflation rate for the first eight months of the year is a much more subdued 4.4 percent. For all of 1988, wholesale prices rose 4 percent. In August, gasoline prices plunged 12.1 percent, their third consecutive monthly decline, while natural gas prices dropped 5 percent and home heating oil costs fell 2.1 percent. Analysts said the good news on energy prices should soon be coming to an end, however, given recent increases in crude oil prices. Food costs posted a 0.3 percent rise in August, led by a 4.4 percent jump in beef prices and a 3.9 percent rise in the cost of eggs. Prices of fruits, vegetables, chickens and turkeys all fell during the month. The various changes left the Producer Price Index, before adjusting for normal seasonal variations, at 113.3, meaning a hypothetical marketbasket of goods costing $ 100 in 1982 would have cost $ 113.30 in August. The Consumer Price Index, which measures retail-price inflation, has also been moderating in recent months, with many economists forecasting that the August report, due Tuesday, will show a slight increase of around 0.2 percent. In the other economic reports Friday, the government said: _ The merchandise trade deficit in July shrank by 5.3 percent from the June figure to $ 7.58 billion, the smallest imbalance since December 1984 The improvement reflected a 2.5 percent drop in imports, which offset a 1.8 percent decline in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export sales. _ Industrial production rose 0.3 percent in August, the best advance since a 0.7 percent rise in April The gain was credited to a rebound in mining after the end of a strike and a rise in production at auto plants. _ Business inventories in July climbed 0.6 percent while total business sales were falling 0.9 percent While rising inventories and falling sales would normally be worrisome, economists noted that August data was pointing to a rebound in sales, which should insure that inventory levels stay at manageable levels.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pizza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, evidently alarmed by a <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> experimental marketing foray into pizza, has launched an all-out advertising attack that accuses the fast-food giant of using frozen dough. `` If you're looking for great pizza, make no <PERSON> Mcstake </PERSON>,'' say ads that have been running in newspaper for the past few weeks in the <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION> area, where McDonald's outlets have been selling pizza. `` We always use dough that's made fresh daily. Not McFrozen,'' the Pizza Hut ads say. The nation's largest pizza chain expanded the attack to television commercials Thursday night. Pizza Hut launched the campaign in response to the addition of pizza to menus at 24 <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurants in southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> earlier this summer. The McDonald's experiment is aimed at attracting families and couples during the dinner hour, a slack period in many fast-food outlets. The pizza, which comes in four varieties and ranges in price from $ 5.84 to $ 9.49, is promised within 5 -LCB- minutes after customers place an order. Although Pizza Hut owns about 22 percent of the $ 314 billion-a-year pizza market, it's not taking the McDonald's test lightly. `` The television commercial is very humorous. We're being, however, very serious to our approach to the McDonald's threat,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rydell </PERSON>, a spokesman for Pizza Hut in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION> `` We want to make it clear to them that we are very strong competitors and make sure people are aware of the quality difference between our two products,'' <PERSON> Rydell </PERSON> said Friday. Pizza Hut officials have not determined how long the advertising campaign will last, <PERSON> Rydell </PERSON> said. `` It really depends on how long the test takes. Once we see there's really no need to continue it, we'll discontinue it.'' Rather than fighting back, <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> is `` McDelighted that they noticed how good our test product is,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubner </PERSON>. `` We want to thank them for giving our own ad campaign some extra topping,'' he said.

 Federal regulators are about to file a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> seeking $ 1.1 billion in damages from the failed thrift for alleged widespread fraud, experts said Thursday. Several newspapers have reported that the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> would sue <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, its parent <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and officers of both companies. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzo </PERSON>, co-author of `` Inside Job,'' a book about fraud among S & amp; Ls, said sources had told him the 150-page complaint was readied six weeks ago but stalled when <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> lawyers took it to their counterparts in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for approval. <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> denied knowledge of any pending action against against the <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, Calif.-based thrift or American <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was established under the sweeping thrift bailout which President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed into law Aug. 9. The Los Angeles Times and the <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> -RRB- Register reported Thursday that the suit might invoke the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute, which allows triple damages in civil cases. American <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> could not be reached for comment Thursday. In the past the company has denied any wrongdoing. The suit will allege misconduct in transactions involving a tax-sharing plan, the high-yield corporate securities known as junk bonds, a hotel in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> company and three <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> communities, <PERSON> Pizzo </PERSON> and others said. Federal regulators seized <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> on April 14. It now is under control of the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>, and analysts said the <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> crisis will be the new agency's costliest bailout. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has said $ 1.5 billion had been lost `` in the Lincoln fiasco'' and that discovery of further losses was inevitable. The government took over <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> the day after <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection under federal bankruptcy law. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and his advisers also face a dozen class-action suits filed by about 23,000 bondholders. American <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> has responded by suing the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> to remove <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> from federal conservatorship. In another development, a rating newsletter in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, listed <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> as the worst-performing thrift in the nation, with $ 787.9 million in losses for the April-June quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Bauer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> accounted for 16 percent of the losses incurred by the 939 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls that ran in the red.

<TEXT>
 Jitters continued Friday in the junk bond market, where trading remained thin amid wild rumors, further price drops and lack of new information about the credit troubles of retailing giant <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In response to one widespread market rumor, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> late Friday denied through a spokesman that it planned a news conference to discuss serious problems at an unnamed, major commercial bank, whose creditworthiness allegedly had been battered by the recent plunge in value of its junk bond holdings. Meanwhile, traders remained anxious for word on whether <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> was able to pull off a financial restructuring that would prop up its own troubled high-yield junk bonds, which are the crux of the market's current difficulties. One of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s ailing businesses, <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, was scheduled to make a major loan payment Friday to prevent default on its bonds, and <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> was engaged in feverish negotiations with investors to draw capital needed to pull off the rescue. Late Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said it had reached conditional agreement with one of its major stockholders, <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, on a $ 250 million loan to help meet the payment. Disclosure on Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> might not be able to make the payment sent the junk bond market into a tailspin, as panicky investors dumped issues they deemed especially risky. Traders said there was very little dealing in Allied junk bonds as well as the high-yield, high-risk bonds of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s other retail unit, <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which also is in financial straits. Gauging activity in the overall junk market can be difficult, because most trading takes place over-the-counter _ that is, between dealers who negotiate the price to be paid for a given bond _ instead of in bidding on an open exchange. Very few junk bonds are listed on the American and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> exchanges and tallies on overall market volume are not available daily. Though quoted prices on a number of junk issues moved sharply lower in recent sessions, traders noted there was little actual buying and selling. Among distressed issues, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> bonds have lost $ 200 per $ 1,000 in face value in recent days while yields jumped to 28 percent, although traders said few of the bonds changed hands. But rumors that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> would meet the debt payment spiked Federated bonds up $ 30 per $ 1,000 in face value around midday and they held at those levels in later trading. Traders agree that making the payment will help prop up <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> bonds, but they were less optimistic that it would immediately cure the ills of the rest of the market. `` In terms of lending credibility to the junk market as a whole, it's not going to take just one day,'' said one trader. Even quality issues continued to be depressed on Friday, even though there was no indication their creditworthiness had changed. Some <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> bonds lost $ 15 per $ 1,000 in face value, while Stop' N Shop bonds, touched by trouble in the retail sector, also slipped as much as $ 30 per $ 1,000. `` The trend in the market is separation between quality junk and junky junk,'' one trader said. `` If people are going to start reinvesting, they're going to feel a whole lot happier owning quality.'' One economist who spoke on condition of anonymity characterized junk bonds as a daring investment fit only `` for a submarine commander.'' But others countered that junk bond investors typically are thick skinned. `` People in the market are somewhat accustomed to ` event' situations like this,'' said one trader referring to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s domino effect on the She was confident emotions would settle down and investors would sit tight. Critics have long complained about junk bond-financed leveraged buyouts and restructurings, arguing that the big, high-interest rate debt loads endangers a company's ability to repay. While sophisticated investors will remain loyal to their pet junk issues, one trader conceded that `` anyone who hated an LBO to begin with is going to say ` I told you so.'''

<HEAD>Court Gives Eastern Extension on Disclosure Statement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal bankruptcy judge on Friday gave strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> an additional 60 days to file a disclosure statement for its bankruptcy reorganization plan. At a hearing, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> granted <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s request that Friday's deadline for filing the statement be extended to Nov. 13. The airline's unions opposed the request. If the deadline had n't been extended, other parties would have been free to file competing reorganization plans. Eastern has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since March 9, five days after the start of a strike by pilots, Machinists and flight attendants. The Miami-based airline filed its proposed reorganization plan July 21. The disclosure statement will contain details on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s financial position, including 5-year projections, the company has said The statement will describe how <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> intends to emerge from bankruptcy. Eastern recently revealed to creditors that it will have about $ 370 million less in cash by year end than first projected, having abandoned a plan to sell its Latin American routes. The airline has been renegotiating with its creditors the repayment terms to reflect the anticipated shortfall. Eastern parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> appears set to underwrite some of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s obligations. In another hearing in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> this past week, <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> approved a plan for payment of $ 98.3 million <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> owes to employee pension plans. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> is lending Eastern $ 45 million toward the payment, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is paying $ 27 million with the proceeds of asset sales, and the rest has been deferred until July.

 <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it had reached conditional agreement with one of its major stockholders, <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, on a $ 250 million loan to help the struggling retail and real estate company meet interest payments due on its bonds. However, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> was technically in default on one series of bonds issued by its <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> division. The company said it was unable to make an interest payment on the bonds Friday. The Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement it had entered an automatic 30-day grace period during which it could still make the payment. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said it had met a separate interest payment due on another series of Allied notes. The loan from <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; York would be used to provide cash for Allied and <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s other retail unit, <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to operate while <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> refinances and restructures and to meet their interest payments. The company said the loan from <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> York </PERSON> was subject to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s bankers agreeing to several conditions, including <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s securing from <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> an extension until April 1990 of an $ 800 million loan. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said it was continuing negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> and the other banks. The company announced last week that it was being forced to restructure and put its prize <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s department store chain up for sale to cope with its massive debt, much of which was incurred in the separate acquisitions of Allied and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has approximately $ 11.5 billion in outstanding debt. Of that amount, $ 3 billion is in short-term obligations, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which has a 24.5 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, was expected to gain a larger interest in <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for granting the loan. There has been speculation that Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON>, who owns nearly 54 percent of the Toronto-based company, would relinquish his controlling interest. Ms. <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON> declined to confirm that <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; York would increase its interest in <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, but said the terms of the agreement between the two companies would be announced when all details of the restructuring were finalized. The <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> statement described the loan as convertible, which suggested the loan could be converted into stock in <LOCATION> Campeau </LOCATION>. The statement also indicated <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; York would be taking an active role in the management of the firm. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said a management group which was overseeing the restructuring would report to a committe of directors, `` including representatives of minority shareholders.'' Without the loan from <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it appeared uncertain how <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> would be able to obtain credit so that its department stores could stock shelves adequately before the crucial Christmas season. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> stock again did not trade Friday while the company negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; York and its creditors. Trading in <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s shares had been halted since Wednesday. Disclosure of the severity of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s financial problems on Wednesday rocked the market for high-interest `` junk bonds'' that the company used to finance its buyouts of Allied and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and contributed to a selloff in the stock market. The market waited Thursday and Friday for further word from <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, but the lack of news kept the market on edge. Trading was thin and dominated by rumors. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> reported a loss of $ 124 million in the three months ended July 31 on revenue of $ 2.26 billion, compared to a loss of $ 109 million and revenue of $ 2.21 billion a year earlier.

 The struggle over control of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>'s largest electric utility settled on four companies Friday as the deadline passed for filing bankruptcy reorganization plans. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>, which filed for bankruptcy protection in January 1988, announced its plan to retain control Tuesday and formally filed the proposal with the bankruptcy court early Friday afternoon. Several hours later, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illuminating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> became the fourth to add its name to the list. Northeast Utilities, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s largest electric utility, and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westborough </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, filed their plans earlier. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illuminating </ORGANIZATION> plan proposed a merger with <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the only plan to do so. It also called for electricity rate increases of 5.5 percent a year for seven years for <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> customers, matching the rates proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> if <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> operates. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> plan called for increases of 4.8 percent during that period. New Hampshire Gov. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> endorsed the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> plan when it was introduced in July, but then switched allegiance this week to <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> because of the lower rates. But <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayless </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> financial vice president, called his utility the favorite to retain control because its plan already has the approval of shareholders and creditors. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> also needs only state regulators approval for its plan, he said. The other utilities still would have to reach agreement with shareholders and creditors, and get approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, something <PERSON> Bayless </PERSON> said could prolong the bankruptcy case for two more years. The fact that <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s payoff to creditors and shareholders would be in securities while some of the other proposals offered cash or a combination did not deter <PERSON> Bayless </PERSON>. `` To our creditors, getting paper in April is a heckuva lot better than getting cash a year or two later,'' he said. The next step in the bankruptcy case will be hearings on the four plans, which federal bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Yacos </PERSON> hopes to conclude by mid-November. Then creditors and shareholders would vote on their choice, and <PERSON> Yacos </PERSON> would make the final decision. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, with almost 400,000 customers, filed for bankruptcy under the burden of its 36 percent share of the $ 6.2 billion <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear plant. Negotiations have dragged on since then for a reorganization plan that would satisfy creditors, shareholders and the state. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has the largest share of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, which has been completed for three years, but has been unable to get a commercial operating license. United Illuminating's 17.5 percent is the second-largest share of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> own smaller shares. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illuminating </ORGANIZATION> valued its plan at $ 2.2 billion, matching the value of the plan proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, regardless of whether <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> operates commercially. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> placed a $ 2 billion value on its plan if <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> runs, $ 1.9 if it does not. Northeast valued its plan at $ 1.9 billion regardless.

<HEAD>Airlines Raise Some Discount Fares</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: For Saturday PMs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an apparent effort to soften the impact of travel bargains offered to fall vacationers, several major airlines have raised a type of discount fare popular with business travelers. This past week the airlines hiked `` Supercoach'' one-way fares, favored by business fliers because they have more lenient advance-purchase requirements than cheaper discount fares and do n't require a Saturday-night stay The `` Supercoach'' fares, usually 15 percent to 40 percent below standard economy fares, were raised by around $ 20 for a one-way ticket. For example, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' lowest `` Supercoach'' fare from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> has been increased from $ 221 one way to $ 241. A three-day advance-purchase fare on <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> was boosted from $ 269 to $ 289. The action appears aimed at recovering part of the revenue lost from the big industrywide fare cuts for the fall season announced in mid-August. At that time, the carriers extended summer travel bargains and cut round-trip fares by as much as $ 160 to lure passengers in the historically weak autumn season. Most fares to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were reduced by $ 100 into next spring. But the latest increase's effect is akin to putting a finger in the dike, some analysts believe. `` The carriers are desperately trying to salvage a very serious problem that has occurred,'' said <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Maldutis </PERSON>, who follows the airline industry for <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` They have had a massive erosion in yield. ... Any fare actions that are taken now are basically to stem the damage.'' An airline's yield, which reflects the average price of a ticket paid by a passenger for each mile flown, has become the name of the game in the competitive climate of the nation's airline industry. The increase was started by <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, an aggressive mid-sized carrier based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that is paying $ 210 million to buy 16 DC-9 aircraft, as well as gates and other airport facilities in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Midway upped its `` Supercoach'' fares Wednesday by $ 10 one way. The bigger carriers, including <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, quickly matched the move. But they raised the fares by $ 20. Some airlines raised `` Supercoach'' fares only in a few cities they serve to match competitors, while others made widespread boosts. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON>, for example, said that carrier was increasing the fares in markets `` all over the country''. But Delta is making the change only `` in a very, very few selected markets,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON>. Eastern is `` considering some selective increases,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, like <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, had proposed six weeks ago eliminating many `` Supercoach'' fares, but the move was n't matched by competitors and it dropped the idea. `` It was an effort on our part to simplify the one-way fare structure,'' said <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>.
