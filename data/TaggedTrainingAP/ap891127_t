 <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> is feasting on the record $ 27.8 million earned by `` Back to the Future Part II'' in its Thanksgiving-weekend debut. The sequel to the 1985 hit knocked another sequel out of the record books as the highest-grossing Thanksgiving release, according to figures released Monday. `` Rocky IV'' grossed $ 20 million during the Friday to Sunday period in 1985. For the long holiday weekend that began Wednesday, `` Back to the Future Part II'' collected $ 43 million and set single-day admission records on Wednesday and Thursday, with grosses exceeding $ 7.2 million each day. But the strong opening of the film starring <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> and directed by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemeckis </PERSON> failed to surpass the all-time three-day opening record, set this year by `` Batman'' with $ 42.7 million, according to <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Exhibitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Total movie house revenues for autumn hit a record of $ 832 million, up 24 percent from last fall Thanksgiving business for the top 10 was more than $ 78 million, up 50 percent from 1988. <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s gangster film `` Harlem Nights'' dropped to second place with ticket sales of $ 11.1 million from Friday through Sunday, down 31 percent from the previous weekend. Disney's animated hit `` The Little Mermaid'' rode a rising tide of popularity to surge 39 percent last weekend, making $ 8.4 million to come in third. The baby-rearing comedy `` Look Who's Talking'' earned $ 7.9 million to claim fourth place. In fifth was the ensemble drama `` Steel Magnolias,'' which collected $ 7.1 million. In sixth was another animated film, `` All Dogs Go to Heaven,'' grossing $ 5 million. The Christmas-themed reindeer movie `` Prancer'' came in seventh with $ 4.1 million. In eighth place was the sentimental drama `` Dad'' on $ 2.9 million, followed by `` The Bear'' with $ 2.3 million and `` Crimes and Misdemeanors'' with $ 1.5 million. Here are the top movies for Friday through Sunday as tallied by Entertainment Data and Exhibitor Relations. Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately available. 1. `` Back to the Future Part II,'' Universal, $ 27.8 million weekend gross, 1,865 screens, $ 14,925 per screen, $ 43 million total gross, one week in release. 2. `` Harlem Nights,'' Paramount, $ 11.1 million, 2,180 screens, $ 5,108 per screen, $ 34.9 million, two weeks. 3. `` The Little Mermaid,'' <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, $ 8.4 million, 999 screens, $ 8,393 per screen, $ 16.8 million, two weeks. 4. `` Look Who's Talking,'' Tri-Star, $ 7.9 million, 1,651 screens, $ 4,771 per screen, $ 96.6 million, seven weeks. 5. `` Steel Magnolias,'' Tri-Star, $ 7.1 million, 720 screens, $ 9,797 per screen, $ 15.6 million, two weeks. 6. `` All Dogs Go to Heaven,'' <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, $ 5 million, 1,590 screens, $ 3,152 per screen, $ 11.2 million, two weeks. 7. `` Prancer,'' <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>, $ 4.1 million, 1,717 screens, $ 2,361 per screen, $ 7.8 million, two weeks. 8. `` Dad,'' Universal, $ 2.9 million, 1,188 screens, $ 2,465 per screen, $ 15.1 million, five weeks. 9. `` The Bear,'' Tri-Star, $ 2.3 million, 1,054 screens, $ 2,224 per screen, $ 23.5 million, five weeks. 10. `` Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.5 million, 525 screens, $ 2,777 per screen, $ 13.2 million, seven weeks.

 <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> had it all _ a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M.B.A. </ORGANIZATION>, a profitable computer software company. But he sold his firm to follow a dream, a dream to one day supply contact lenses to all the world's egg-laying chickens. Wise's red contact lenses are already on 100,000 chickens nationwide, and his company, <ORGANIZATION> Animalens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is growing. Oh, sure, people laughed at first. `` We'd talk to investors. They'd say: ` Sounds neat. Good luck,''' Wise recalls. But while Wise is willing to joke a little about his enterprise, he's all business when it comes to discussing the future, which he says looks sunny side up. Before writing Wise off as a cuckoo, understand that there is a sound idea behind his scheme. Chickens become positively mellow when they see the world through rose-tinted glasses _ or better yet, fire-engine red contact lenses. Scientists are n't sure why, but a rosy outlook eliminates the pecking order among chickens, which normally tend to be pretty ornery critters. Red-eyed birds spend less time fighting and more time laying eggs. They also eat less. According to <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>'s calculations, that translates into an annual savings of at least 50 cents a chicken, or 2.5 cents per dozen eggs. With 1.2 billion laying chickens multiplied by the 20 dozen eggs each yields a year, the savings could be $ 600 million. With such benefits, Wise is sure farmers will soon flock to buy his contact lenses, which go for a modest 20 cents a pair, or 15 cents if bought in bulk. The hard lenses are put in place in seconds by holding the bird's head steady. They stay in place for the life of the bird, or about a year. `` The challenge is to go out and sell the product, especially when it's new and different,'' Wise says. `` This certainly falls into the category of being new and different.'' The idea for the lenses goes back to <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>'s childhood on the chicken farm his father managed in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the early 1960s. Wise's dad, <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON>, tried to produce lenses for chickens after a salesman told him about a farm where chickens afflicted with cataracts behaved better than those with normal sight. `` But the technology did n't exist at the time for the lens to work,'' explains Wise, 41. `` The early lenses blinded the chickens.'' The elder Wise's fledgling company folded. His son went off to college, worked in the shipping industry for a time and then founded a computer software firm in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> eight years ago that prospered. But the chickens and the lenses were still on his mind. Three years ago he sold his company for several million dollars and set out to pursue his dream. `` I got out of computers because of this,'' Wise says. `` And I still do n't miss computers. I've believed in this for a long time.'' Not that everything has flown smoothly since jumping from computer software to chicken eyewear. The lenses had to be painstakingly designed so they would n't distort the chickens' vision or irritate their eyes Wise keeps a jar in his office filled with hundreds of pairs of failed test lenses that looks like a container of jelly beans. `` I look at that and I think ` That's all behind us,''' Wise says. `` We already know a lot someone else would have to figure out.'' Eventually, a usable lens was developed. Wise contracted with several small plants around <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to produce the lenses, and field tests were conducted on farms around the country. Now, Wise says, the testing is over and it's time for his dream to fly. `` I'm very confident,'' Wise says from his firm's small suite of offices in this affluent <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb. `` 1990 is going to be the inflection point for us, when this really takes off.''

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> school principal <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> became suspicious when two students who had been suspended for illicit drug use passed a drug test with little trouble. `` We found out a couple of weeks ago that there's a chemical that washes drugs out of the system,'' said <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON>, whose school _ <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> High </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> _ has received national acclaim for its drug-fighting efforts. `` The students use it full time: washing out their systems and being tested, all the time being high.'' The street name of the chemical is `` Golden Seal,'' said <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> teacher <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, explaining the `` herb'' also is popular with students in the nation's capital. This latest student scam is proof that the war on drugs in schools is serious and must be waged in a no-nonsense but flexible manner, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` Kids recognize all the problems of the system,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Spingarn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` They know how to circumvent us better than we know how to plan.'' The battle to keep the nation's youngsters away from drugs has evolved from a mere `` Just Say No'' slogan, devised by former First Lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, to a threat by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to end federal aid to schools, colleges and universities tat fail to document tough policies against illegal drug use. The tougher approach reflects the nation's growing concern with drug abuse. Statistics say that 5 percent of high school seniors drink daily and more than 60,000 adolescents ages 12 and 13 have tried cocaine. `` Young people show a faster propensity to develop an addiction and the damage by addiction can be more permanent,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. The government is expected to spend some $ 500 million under the drug education program this fiscal year, about $ 180 million more than the year that ended Sept. 30. In 1986, only $ 3 million was budgeted for drug education. Almost all high schools and 87 percent of elementary schools offer some sort of anti-drug lessons. The new national drug strategy says school-based prevention programs should be reinforced by tough policies on use, possession and distribution of drugs. Schools are trying a variety of approaches with no clear trend emerging. Success is hard to determine since so many of the approaches are new. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, football players are tested. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> laws allow spot searches of students, and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> plans to use drug-sniffing dogs in the schools. <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, schools notify police of every campus drug incident, suspend students for six to 10 days for drug possession or use, and transfer repeat offenders. The <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> has decided any student convicted of trafficking in or possessing drugs, on or off school property, will be subject to expulsion. `` Drug Free Zone'' signs surround public and private schools in Prince <PERSON> Georges </PERSON>' County, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, warning that anyone found possessing or distributing drugs within 1,000 feet of a school yard faces strict penalties, ranging from 5 to 40 years in prison. Education officials estimate as many as 25 states have some sort of drug-free zone programs or laws. `` We see more expulsions and suspensions for use because it's against the law,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Better </PERSON>, staff director of the Education Department's Drug-Free Schools Recognition Program `` But most schools have referral and re-entry programs.'' At the local level, Education Department officials estimate 73 percent of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s 16,490 school districts have written policies against substance abuse. Of these, more than 90 percent involve notification of parents and or police, suspension or counseling. Most major education groups avoid advocating specific drug policies for schools. At most they offer general guidelines, like those jointly developed by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have problems when the feds try to impose decisions on the locals, so national groups avoid doing the same thing,'' said <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Armistead </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secondary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principals </ORGANIZATION>. Hall, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said: `` We do n't believe in dealing with these people as criminals. You really ca n't incarcerate your way out of a drug problem.'' Hall pointed to statistics that say `` school buildings or campuses are one of the least popular places'' for students to use or distribute drugs. Also, he said, students tend to use drugs more at night and on weekends. `` PRIDE supports treatment on demand,'' said Hall. `` But the problem is it's difficult to draw the line on whether the school is responsible or the parents.'' <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> insisted: `` It is a school problem because they ca n't learn when they are stoned They ca n't learn when they're dead. They ca n't learn when they're in the hospital. We're going to be paying for their rehabilitation forever and ever because so many people are hooked.'' <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> said his drug-fighting efforts encompass more grassroots approaches of `` sending out letters of complaints to local liquor stores that sell alcohol to minors'' to encouraging temporary suspensions for drug use and automatic expulsion for drug sales. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s citywide policies, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> offers early-morning tutoring for students who want help with school work and `` to talk about what's going on with them, with somebody they want to trust.'' Jenlane Gee, a teacher from <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> _ recognized along with <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> as among the nation's best teachers and principals _ complained that the government's drug-fighting efforts have ignored elementary schools. Gee, who teaches third graders at <ORGANIZATION> Christine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sipherd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said just as much emphasis should be focused on the elementary schools because studies show that children usually decide by the third to fifth grade whether to experiment with drugs. <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> added that simply talking _ or acting _ tough wo n't stem student drug use. `` I think there's a hard line'' emerging in the schools, he said. `` But there's no comprehensive policy that helps kids to make good decisions about their future, their bodies and their values.''

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> broke the mold of dour, intransigent Soviet leaders during his first foray onto the world stage, and he's been surprising now-wary Western counterparts ever since his 1985 summit with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Based on his past performance, there's every reason to believe that the 58-year-old <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might spring a surprise on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when the two meet off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> on Dec. 2 and 3 _ so much so that <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials say extensive preparations are under way to prepare the American president for anything that might be thrown at him. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform policies in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have been surprising enough to Americans. His style leans to the unexpected, as well. When <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> posed for pictures at the start of their meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> four years ago, the American president kept mum, heeding his advisers' counsel not to take a chance on spoiling the atmosphere of his first U.S.-Soviet summit with an offhand remark. The Russian showed no such caution. When a reporter told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> he had been described by a fellow Soviet official as a man with a nice smile but iron teeth, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> replied: `` I'm still using my own teeth, but as to the substance of your question, both the president and I have good grounds to believe we can have a good talk.'' Later the same day, after his tete-a-tete with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stretched well beyond the carefully choreographed schedule, the Soviet leader broke a comment blackout imposed by both sides. `` I think we will have a good relationship,'' he said. At the last snap summit, in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, in 1986, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> went prepared to negotiate the framework for a treaty reducing intermediate-range nuclear missiles. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> instead proposed eliminating all nuclear weapons in all categories. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took him up on the challenge, and the two men engaged in what was later described as history's highest-stakes poker game, seeing and raising each other one weapons category after another until they stumbled over the last chip: <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s beloved Star Wars plan. The American refused to concede; the Soviet insisted it was all or nothing. And nothing it was. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s advisers have let it be known the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president will not let himself be drawn into a game like that at the summit off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. But as recently as last May, when Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> expecting to set a date for the next U.S.-Soviet summit, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> caught the new foreign policy chief off guard with a bold new offer of substantial cuts in conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The initiative broke a years-old logjam over how to count and reduce the two sides' non-nuclear ground and air forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But it embarrassed <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who was unprepared for such a move, and gave <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a public relations coup. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, facing criticism that he was slow and indecisive in developing a policy toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, recovered at the end of the month with his own conventional arms proposal announced at a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. But six weeks later, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pulled another trick out of his hat. As the leaders of the seven great industrial democracies gathered in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for their annual economic summit, they received a letter from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appealing for entry to the world economic community. After decades of cold war and economic rivalry, the Soviet chief wrote that his effort to restructure the Soviet economic and society `` is inseparable from the policy tending toward full and entire participation in the world economy.'' His letter instantly became the central focus of the summit talks.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The two deadliest weeks of the 10-year-old civil war have served only to set the stage for more bloodletting. The battle of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> _ at least the first one _ is over. The huge rebel offensive that began Nov. 11 failed to achieve its principal objective of persuading the government to make significant concessions in the quest for a negotiated solution. Indeed, with the administration claiming victory and demanding what amounts to the rebels' surrender, and the insurgents promising to finish off `` the mortally wounded fascist beast,'' Salvadorans can only expect weeks or months more of warfare of an intensity unseen since early 1981, when the rebels' first `` final offensive'' failed. `` This battle against ARENA is a battle that can not turn back, a battle to sweep fascism once and for all from our country,'' the rebel clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION> said late last week. ARENA is the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, the governing party. `` They -LRB- the guerrillas -RRB- tried, and they lost,'' President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said, proclaiming the military defeat of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. The government contends its forces killed or wounded a third of the rebel army, estimated at about 7,000 full-time combatants. Most foreign journalists who spent day after day in the combat zones doubt the official claim that more than 1,000 guerrillas were killed. The figure appears inconsistent with the relatively few dead guerrillas seen by reporters who daily compared notes on what they saw where and when. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> says the decimation suffered by guerrilla forces has been so telling that they will be capable from now on of only `` terrorist'' actions. The contention is suspect, as the president, the defense minister and every colonel who went on record in the months prior to the spectacular push said the same thing: that insurgent capacity had been reduced to isolated terrorist activity. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> acknowledged in an interview after the fighting waned last week that the guerrillas `` are doing some things that look more like regrouping than withdrawing.'' Radio Vencermos on Friday referred to the 10-day concerted assault on the capital and several provincial cities as `` the first period of offensive,'' implying that others are in the offing. The war began in late 1979, but its roots go back decades. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> is the smallest country on the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>'s mainland With 5 million people in an area the size of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, it is also the most densely populated. The consolidation of landholdings by relatively recent immigrant families _ not of the centuries-old Indian-Spanish mix that makes up more than 90 percent of the population _ disenfranchized hundreds of thousands of peasants who raised subsistence crops on collectively held village lands. Landless peasants became migrant peons who went seasonally from the coffee harvest to picking cotton to cutting cane _ the workforce of an economy that was almost completely dependent on the export of those three products. The agricultural export economy made vast fortunes for a tiny elite. The rich have mansions on their plantations, sumptuous homes in the capital's posh western sector and houses or apartments in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. They tune in to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television stations with their satellite dishes and send their children to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> universities while the two-thirds of the population lives in dire poverty. Peasants and workers organized widely in the 1970s. By the end of the decade, left-leaning federations demanding profound structural reform to more equitably distribute wealth were regularly putting tens of thousands of people in the street. They probably constituted, if counted together, a plurality of Salvadorans. The growing left threatened the privileged, who reacted ferociously. About 30,000 people _ most of them real or perceived leftists _ are estimated to have been slain by government troops or right-wing death squads between 1979 and 1984, when such murders began to decline. Repression combined with the vast majority's manifest lack of economic opportunity to create a fertile field for revolutionary harvest. The government and its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> patron _ <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has provided <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> $ 4 billion in aid this decade _ contend a fledgling democracy is on its feet. The left says intimidation, persecution and murder still await those who avow social change. On Nov. 16, armed men broke into the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus residence of six Jesuit priests and educators who had been labeled subversive ideologues by the radical right. The gunmen killed the priests, their housekeeper and her teen-age daughter. Other Jesuits at the school say witnesses saw army troops enter the residence before the shots rang out. The government and guerrillas sat down in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in September to discuss peace for the first time in two years. They met again in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> last month, but the sessions were strained and fruitless. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> last week urged the rebels to admit their defeat, `` come to their senses, lay down their arms and incorporate themselves in the democratic process.'' Asked if that scenario was realistic, <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said: `` It may not sound realistic to the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin-Baro </PERSON> _ one of the slain priests _ was vice-rector of the university and head of its prestigious polling institute. His recent surveys showed that the majority of Salvadorans were personally uncommitted to the program of either the government or the insurgency. The only cause that commanded majority support was peace.

 A priest who is Russian Orthodox by necessity, not choice, stood before his congregation in the Cathedral of the Transfiguration on a recent Sunday and proclaimed allegiance to Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yaroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Chukhny </PERSON>'s words echoed from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, long competitors for the souls of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. They are certain to reverberate back to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Friday becomes the first Soviet leader to meet a Roman Catholic pontiff. The 35-year-old priest took the boldest step yet in a revolt against the forced consolidation of the small <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> into the Russian Orthodox Church in 1946. After his proclamation, he said the Ukrainian church `` does exist and it has legalized itself.'' <PERSON> Chukhny </PERSON> never considered himself Russian Orthodox. He attended a Russian Orthodox seminary in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> because it was the only path to the priesthood. Ukrainian Catholics who kept the faith underground for two generations see the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> trip as a sign they will regain legal status as a separate denomination. With that will come a chance to reclaim confiscated churches and property, including <PERSON> Chukhny </PERSON>'s cathedral, and an element of national identity in an area that was part of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> before World War II. `` I think <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is a cunning guy, and he would n't go to meet the pope with nothing in his pockets,'' said <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Soltys </PERSON>, a 44-year-old communications engineer and Ukrainian Catholic. `` Behind two or three locked doors, I think the church already has been legalized.'' In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, religious groups need government approval. Ukrainian Catholicism, with an estimated 2.5 to 5 million followers in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, does not have it, and many followers have been fined or imprisoned. Expressing the Russian Orthodox Church's resistance to legalization, Metropolitan Filaret of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> said the Ukrainian church had been a `` source of national, social and religious oppression'' during its nearly 400 years. After <PERSON> Chukhny </PERSON>'s proclamation, <PERSON> Soltys </PERSON> and other believers took over the Cathedral of the Transfiguration, where Ukrainian Catholics are dominant in the congregation. In his liturgy for Sunday, Oct. 29, the priest acknowledged the spiritual leadership of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> and prayed for him instead of Patriarch <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON>, head of the Russian Orthodox Church. He recalled in an interview later: `` I told them I had gone over to the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. I said, ` Forgive me if you do n't agree, but I do n't feel any allegiance to the Russian Church.' <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> is another name for the Ukrainian church. <PERSON> Chukhny </PERSON> said the religious tenets of the Russian Orthodox and Ukrainian Catholic churches are much the same, and the only real differences are in language and the ultimate superior. Believers keep a constant vigil inside the <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> cathedral to prevent the Russian Patriarchate from taking it back. On a Sunday in November, several thousand people pressed into the church and about 100 more strained to hear the service from the steps. Russian Orthodox officials accused Ukrainian Catholics of taking over by force and have revoked <PERSON> Chukhny </PERSON>'s right to preach in the Russian Church, but they have not tried to recover the green-domed cathedral built just before the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. `` I'm a religious person,'' said the bearded young priest. `` I've never been interested in politics, but what I did has taken on a political coloring.'' Ukrainian Catholicism has been colored by politics ever since a 16th century agreement gave the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> supremacy over believers in the Ukrainian and <LOCATION> Byelorussian </LOCATION> territory then controlled by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The church kept the ancient Orthodox ritual, and even its name reflects centuries of turmoil. It is known variously as the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ukrainian </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Uniate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. After being separated from the rest of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> for nearly 600 years, the <LOCATION> Lvov </LOCATION> area was reunited with it by force half a century ago. After <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> attacked <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Sept. 1, 1939, <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> sent the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> into eastern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. After the war, the areas were incorporated into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, accused of collaborating with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, was merged with the <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which took over its property and buildings. Among the priests who led the merger program, which Soviet and Russian Orthodox officials insist was voluntary, was <PERSON> Gavriil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostelnik </PERSON>, pastor of the same Cathedral of the Transfiguration. Priests who refused to switch were sent to prison camps, where many died. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gel </PERSON>, who now leads the lay <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Support the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, was imprisoned 18 years for nationalist and human rights activities and for supporting the church. Resistance to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> rule in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> was such that bands of anti-Soviet guerrillas operated in the woods and mountains until the mid-1950s. Gel was released in January 1987, and as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms loosened control of religion, Ukrainian Catholics became bolder. Services in private apartments were replaced by open rallies and demonstrations, but organizers often were fined or jailed. Ukrainian Catholics have reopened as many as 40 churches, and Gel said other priests are following Chukhny's lead. In Gel's life, as in the region, the church is part of the ethnic sentiment of a people dominated at various times over the centuries by Russians, Swedes, Poles, Lithuanians, Austrians and Hungarians. Ukrainians credit the church with keeping their language alive and accuse the Russian Orthodox Church of being cowed by whatever power rules <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. `` We need a return to freedom of religion in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a principle right of a citizen in a democratic country,'' Gel said. `` Renewal of our nation, renewal of our church, is part of the process of decolonization of our people.'' `` A people without a church can not be sovereign.'' Gel said. He sees the Ukrainian church playing the role of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> _ a center of resistance to Communist rule. That could worry the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, which faces demands for greater autonomy or outright independence in regions along its western border. As for the Russian Orthodox Church, <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Filaret </ORGANIZATION> wrote to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News: `` You do n't need to be clairvoyant to understand that the restoration of the former <ORGANIZATION> Uniate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> will lead to religious and political struggle.''

 Early election returns Monday showed opposition parties forging ahead of Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, threatening the family dynasty that has dominated independent <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> Reports by government-run television said the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was leading in more races than any single opposition party but was falling short of enough seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to form the next government without entering a coalition. The television network said that final results in 246 of the 524 contests gave the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> party 103 seats while the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION>, the major opposition force, and a fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> and two communist parties captured 112. Smaller parties and independent candidates won the other seats. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is no longer going to be the majority in the next government,'' the television commentator said. `` Who will form the next government and who will be the next prime minister is going to take some time to determine.'' The election campaign that began in October was the most violent since <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> gained its independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. Balloting in the vast nation was staggered over three days _ Wednesday, Friday and Sunday _ and it was uncertain when final official results would be reported. Millions of ballots were ruled invalid by the election commission, including those cast in 18 percent of the precincts in <LOCATION> Gandhi </LOCATION>'s home district of <LOCATION> Amethi </LOCATION>, and it ordered that new elections be held Monday. By the time voting ended in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 25 states and seven federal territories, at least 137 people including six candidates had been killed in election-related violence since Wednesday. The election commission ruled there was widespread ballot-rigging, voter intimidation and murderous assaults and ordered new elections Monday in one-fifth of the country's 590,000 polling booths. The election was seen as a referendum on <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s leadership since he assumed power in 1984 amid hopes he could lead <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> toward a new age. While the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was expected to sweep the southern states, it appeared to be in serious trouble in the north, its traditional stronghold. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> still could emerge as the single largest party, making it the likely choice to try to form the next government of the world's largest democracy. But it would be forced into an uneasy alliance with Hindu fundamentalists or the communists. The National Front coalition, led by former <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> ally <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, was running in second place. It was followed by the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bharatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> India-Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. At stake in the elections were 524 seats in the 543-seat <LOCATION> Lok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sabha </LOCATION>, or House of the People, the policy-making lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that will choose the next prime minister. Voting was postponed in several districts because of incomplete voter lists or candidates' deaths and the other 19 seats will be determined in later elections. Opinion polls had indicated <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would win from 170 to 220 seats, far short of the 267 needed for a majority. The party 415 seats in the December 1984 elections that propelled <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> to power. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> accepted `` under protest'' the <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s order for new balloting in <LOCATION> Amethi </LOCATION>, said party spokesman <PERSON> Anand </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>. He denied the allegations of fraud and said they were a plot to embarrass <PERSON> Ghandi </PERSON> who has represented the district since 1980. But the decision dealt a stunning blow to <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, who had been expected to easily win re-election to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Although voter fraud is common in Indian politics, never has a re-vote been ordered in the prime minister's own backyard. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s position already had been weakend by criticism of his leadership and reports of high-level corruption in his government. Defeat for <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, the grandson of Prime Minister <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON> and son of Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, could herald the end of the dynasty that has governed <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for all but 29 months since it became independent. The election will be won or lost in the Hindi heartland, the northern states of <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Madhya </PERSON> <PERSON> Pradesh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Uttar </PERSON> <PERSON> Pradesh </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION>, which together control more than half the seats in the <LOCATION> Lok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sabha </LOCATION>. Neither Congress nor the opposition adopted a platform calling for major changes in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s domestic or foreign policy. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s leadership became the main issue of a bitter campaign that claimed at least 182 lives since it began in October The 45-year-old prime minister portrayed the election as a simple choice between stability and chaos. Only the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ the party of his mother and his grandfather _ could provide economic improvement and fight the ethnic and religious tensions threatening the country's unity, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of five parties with regional, religious and ideological differences, capitalized on accusations of high-level corruption and ineptitude and promised honest and efficient leadership. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was propelled to power hours after his mother's assassination Oct. 31, 1984 He promised to clean up <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s notoriously corrupt and inefficient bureaucracy, liberalize the economy and initiate reforms that would attack poverty and illiteracy and prepare <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for the 21st century But the initial aura inspired by the youthful <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, a Cambridge-educated former airline pilot, faded as allegations of corruption dogged his friends, his party and his government.

 Fifty years ago, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and met the fierce `` ghost army'' of white-clad ski troops whose gallant fight in a hopeless cause was admired around the world. The Finns lost the 105-day war to their huge neighbor, but memories of their courage helped make their independence secure after World War II. `` The Russians were badly organized and stuck out like sore thumbs against the white snow in their dark uniforms,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Toivo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahjopalo </PERSON>, who was a junior artillery officer on the shores of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ladoga </LOCATION> on the Karelian isthmus. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers were well equipped, their strategy and planning were poor. <PERSON> Ahjopalo </PERSON> said his artillery unit of two 57mm guns killed 1,600 Soviets in 48 hours. `` It was too easy ... almost shameful to kill them,'' he said. `` The Russians kept coming at us in straight lines and our two guns picked them off like flies. The frozen lake was awash with blood.'' A new Finnish movie called `` The Winter War'' will open Thursday, the anniversary of the outbreak of what may have been the coldest war in history. Several books and articles on the war also have been published recently. In the era of glasnost, Soviet historians have increased their casualty figures from fewer than 50,000 Soviet soldiers killed to 74,000, with more than 200,000 wounded. The official Finnish estimate of total Soviet casualties is nearly 1 million, a number also hinted at in the memoirs of <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, the former Soviet leader. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, a nation of 3.7 million in 1939, suffered 22,000 soldiers killed and 43,000 wounded. On Nov. 26, 1939, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Molotov </PERSON> accused Finnish troops of shooting across the border near <LOCATION> Mainila </LOCATION>, a village in southeastern <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. The Finns denied it, and Soviet historians now say <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> used the incident as a pretext to invade <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> four days later. `` It looks very likely that <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> ordered the shots to be fired by his own troops,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dongarov </PERSON>, a Soviet Foreign Ministry researcher. `` The Soviets were worried about developments in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and a possible German attack on their territory through <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. Besides, there was great anti-Russian feeling and mistrust in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> at the time.'' <PERSON> Dongarov </PERSON> spoke with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> during a visit to <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>. The Winter War was fought in temperatures as low as minus 49 degrees. The severe cold caused frostbite and hallucinations that forced guard duty tours to be reduced from two hours to 30 minutes. <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> had occupied <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in 1938, and in secret negotiations with the Finns, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> demanded the right to build fortifications in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> to protect <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> rejected that and other Soviet demands as violations of its sovereignty. Negotiations broke down after 18 months. The Finns still did not believe <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> would attack, but Field Marshal <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Mannerheim </PERSON> mobilized more than 180,000 men near the border for what was called `` refresher training.'' `` I was literally admiring the sky above <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> when suddenly, totally unexpectedly, Russian planes broke through the clouds and dropped their bombs,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sjoblom </PERSON>, who covered the war for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Minutes later, he scrambled out of a bomb shelter and found the mangled remains of his bicycle in the street. When the Finns had fought for three months against the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which sent in 450,000 soldiers at the start of the war, they were suffering from lack of reserves and ammunition. After a Soviet offensive in March 1940, <PERSON> Mannerheim </PERSON> rejected an offer of aid from the Western powers as `` too little too late,'' and recommended a negotiated peace. A treaty was signed March 12 that forced <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> to cede large areas of eastern <LOCATION> Karelia </LOCATION> to the Soviets. More than 400,000 Karelians had to be evacuated. `` The Winter War demonstrated once again that, when a great power is faced by a small nation whose only goal is to survive, calculations of strength can not be based on pure arithmetic,'' wrote <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, a former Finnish ambassador and statesman. `` In the vast drama of World War II, it was but a short episode. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, like a recalcitrant pawn, refused to move to the square assigned to it by those who controlled the chessboard. ... Finally, it had to submit to fate.'' Fifteen months after the battle ended, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> went to war with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> again, on the side of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

State Judge <PERSON> Eve </PERSON> <PERSON> Preminger </PERSON> gave the order Friday after <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>'s court appointed guardian, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Korn </PERSON>, told her that <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> will have no more than $ 11,000 in cash by the end of the year <PERSON> Korn </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>'s monthly expenses are about $ 14,500, for upkeep and pocket money, and his income from social security, his pension from the Met, and other sources total about $ 8,500 a month. <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>, 87, has Alzheimer's disease and lives in the Hebrew Home for the Aged. Three years ago, <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>'s net worth was estimated at $ 900,000, but much of that was depleted by legal and security expenses required for his protection from former psychiatric patient <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON>, 49, whom he married in 1987. On Sept. 5, state Judge <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciparick </PERSON> annulled the marriage after finding that <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> suffered serious mental impairment because of Alzheimer's disease, and therefore was not capable of agreeing to a marriage contract.

 The `` 14th Occasional Pasadena Doo Dah Parade,'' a tacky ensemble of floats such as the Hibachi `` grill team'' and a outhouse with <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>'s wife inside, weaved through the streets before 50,000 people. Unlike the traditional Rose Parade, Sunday's <PERSON> Doo </PERSON> <PERSON> Dah </PERSON> boasted few rules, no queen and no formal judging, and featured marchers carrying briefcases, lawn furniture and snow shovels. The highlight was the <PERSON> Great </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Drill </PERSON> <PERSON> Team </PERSON>, in which several women and one burly man, all dressed as <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, re-created the actress' infamous policeman-slapping incident with men dressed as <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> motorcycle officers. Other favorites were The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Chainsaw Massacre Drool Team of the Living Dead Dishonor Guard, featuring marchers with live, running chain saws _ with chains removed. There were several Exxon Valdez floats, including one operated by roller skaters who kept falling down and yelling, `` The reef, the reef.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Barbecue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hibachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marching </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION> members banged on barbecues with metal tongs behind a drum major with an ice chest around his neck. Replicas of bathroom fixtures were popular among entrants, including a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> who drove a bike equipped with an outhouse, whose door would open to expose a compromised Mrs. <PERSON> Claus </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Doo </PERSON> <PERSON> Dah </PERSON> parade was first held Jan. 1, 1978, when the Rose Parade was switched to Jan. 2 to avoid being held on a Sunday. Last year's event was the 12th parade, creating some confusion over why this year's was dubbed the 14th. `` Well, this is the ` occasional' parade, and 40 or so of my friends celebrated <PERSON> Doo </PERSON> <PERSON> Dah </PERSON> 13 with a pub crawl along the parade route on New Year's Day, while I was out of town,'' self-proclaimed <PERSON> Doo </PERSON> <PERSON> Dah </PERSON> <PERSON> Czar </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Apanel </PERSON> explained.

 The cultivators of 200-pound radishes and watermelons the size of small deer will get official recognition soon, thanks to new registry for green-thumbed growers. `` Most of the calls I get have been, ` Is this the biggest pumpkin, tomato or whatever?''' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, a specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. `` People will call up and say they have a 200-pound radish and ask if it is a record, and we'd have to say we did n't know. But <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> has developed rules and procedures for harvesting and measuring about 30 varieties of vegetables grown in the state. Already, records have been established with a 10-pound cabbage, a 16-pound, 8-ounce cantaloupe, and a 146-pound watermelon. One of the secrets of growing a super vegetable is to extend its growing season, and that will make most vegetables tough and stringy. The texture of a giant radish, for instance, resembles wood pulp. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumgardner </PERSON>, a retired air conditioning expert in <LOCATION> Levy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, was credited with producing <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s champion watermelon this past summer. `` That's the one that has the official record, but the year before I had one that was 170 pounds,'' said <PERSON> Bumgardner </PERSON>, 72. `` The world record is 270 pounds so I've got a way to go.''

<HEAD>General Says His Ouster From Panama Was Political</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The former head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> says the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration ousted him from his post in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for political reasons because he opposed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies in that country. `` I believe the policy was flawed,'' Gen. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said in an interview in which he described the administration's goals as simplistic and short-sighted. `` The specific language was, the president decided it was time for a change,'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said in describing how <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> told him in July that he was being removed. `` And then when I said I was entitled to more of an explanation ... I was told it had nothing to do with performance but -LRB- was for -RRB- political reasons.'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>'s contention contradicts the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s denial in July when it announced he was being replaced. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, a longtime Latin American hand who retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month, left his post as head of the command just days before the failed Oct. 3 coup attempt to oust Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. During the attempted overthrow, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops blocked two roads in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, spoke with the rebel leaders and watched the firefights from their hillside vantage point. Several congressional leaders contended later that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should have stepped in to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, who generally opposes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop intervention, added, `` The president, I think, in his handling of the last major event, the failed coup, demonstrated his lack of willingness to commit troops.'' The American government started pushing for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster after a series of demonstrations in 1987. The move heightened when the Panamanian general was indicted on drug-trafficking charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1988. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has repeatedly said he is not giving up on efforts to get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of office. The president also has said he considers <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to be the problem _ not the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> heads _ and that if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is forced out and free elections are held, the country will have `` instant improved relations'' with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said that in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's policy, `` There was a lot of heat generated but not necessarily sound policy or strategy to support <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. interests.'' He said the goals of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration were short-term: get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out and restore democracy. `` You link those two together and you have what the administration believed was an easy objective,'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said. `` That means you put your policy ... in the hands of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. If he stays your policy fails. If he goes, you succeed,'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said. `` I know <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>; I did n't want to put the success or failure in his hands.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy assumed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster would remove the problem, but <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> contended it only would create `` a promotion for the next thug.'' The general said his remarks were seen as being soft on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` It is very difficult to speak out on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in a position contrary to the administration's without appearing to be soft on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' he said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> does have to be deposed for democracy to succeed, he conceded, but added the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy can not stop there. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said he sought a plan calling for an internal opposition group, strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for that group and international condemnation of the situation. `` I do not believe a problem of this magnitude can be solved by external forces in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` And we ca n't just transfer a democratic ideal or objective. `` I said we were greatly underestimating <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s staying power. And that was not a popular position to take,'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said. The answer is not military intervention, he said, adding: `` We could intervene and take out <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. That's the easy thing. It's getting out and leaving something behind to say those American military men that lost their lives changed <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for the better.

 Another cultural stereotype will self-destruct when the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nannies </ORGANIZATION> graduates its first male nanny. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Stack </PERSON>, 18, of <ORGANIZATION> Westfield </ORGANIZATION>, will complete the 3 -LCB- - month program Dec. 15 Stack's sense of humor helped him in a similar situation _ in high school when he was the only male in a preschool child care class. Now, it has helped him parry the jests of friends who ca n't help asking if he wants to be <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Poppins </PERSON>. After graduating from <ORGANIZATION> Westfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> last spring, Stack did n't want to go to college, and ruled out military service. Instead, he opted for the nanny program, which he learned about during a job fair. `` The military keeps calling me, but I say, ` I'm going to be a nanny, not a Marine,''' he said. The $ 300 a week, plus room and board that he could earn as a live-in baby sitter, appealed to him. `` My pay goes into my pocket,'' he said. Besides, `` I love kids. They're awesome.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON>, vice president and director of admissions for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nannies </ORGANIZATION>, said about 250 women have graduated from the 5-year-old school. Stack will be its first male graduate. `` We're quite proud of him. He's holding up the grades and he wo n't be hard to place,'' <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> said. `` It raises some eyebrows when men come into a field like this, like male nurse,'' Lord added. `` We've tried males before, they're uncomfortable about being the only male in the class <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>'s going to break the door open.'' Stack said the program focuses on the business side of being a nanny as well as teaching child care and child psychology. To his surprise, a nanny can expect to have health insurance and taxes paid by the employer. He acknowledges that since men have traditionally avoided such occupations, some people question his motivation. But <PERSON> Stack </PERSON> said he's determined to be treated as a professional care giver. `` Hey, it's practice,'' said <PERSON> Stack </PERSON>, who wants to have children some day. `` A nanny is a practice parent.''

 An opposition presidential candidate led in early returns Monday after the governing party's hopeful conceded defeat. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Batlle </PERSON>, candidate of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday night before official returns were released that he had lost the race to <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Both parties are center-right and both candidates have promised to trim down an atrophied welfare state in this small <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> country of 2.9 million people. `` According to the information available, the future president will be Sen. <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON>, to whom I extend my most sincere congratulations and best wishes for success in his term,'' said <PERSON> Batlle </PERSON>, whose name is pronounced BAHT-lee. <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON> said he would issue a public statement on Monday, but acknowledged that he had received congratulatory calls from President <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Liber </PERSON> <PERSON> Seregni </PERSON>, presidential candidate for the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Broad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, issuing the first official returns shortly after midnight that results from 152 of the 8,493 voting stations gave 10,170 votes or 39 percent to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, 8,040 votes or 30 percent to the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and 3,547 votes or 13 percent to the <ORGANIZATION> Broad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of leftist parties. <ORGANIZATION> Equipos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultores </ORGANIZATION>, a respected independent polling agency, projected the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> received 38 percent of the total vote, compared to 31 percent for the <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Equipos </PERSON> did not state how many votes its projection was based on. The leftist coalition <ORGANIZATION> Broad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> tallied 22 percent of the vote nationwide, according to <ORGANIZATION> Equipos </ORGANIZATION>, and the front's cndidate for mayor of the capital <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>, Marxist doctor <PERSON> Tabare </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON>, won that coveted post. <PERSON> Batlle </PERSON> acknowledged that the `` trend indicates a majority for the <ORGANIZATION> Broad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'' in <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>. `` That trend is irreversible,'' he said. `` The next mayor of <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION> will be <PERSON> Tabare </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON>.'' At stake were the presidency, the vice presidency, the posts of 30 senators and 99 deputies, and governments in 19 provinces. A win for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would be the first time it took power since 1967 and only the third time this century. Uruguayans voting to replace <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> and both houses of congress said their main concern was invigorating an economy that has been in decline for three decades. `` Things are n't going to change if politics do n't take a turn and politicians look for something different,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, a 63-year-old retiree. `` When we look at the outside world, there have been tremendous advances,'' said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Larghero </PERSON>, 47, a graphic designer. `` The opposite has occurred here. We deteriorate a little bit each year.'' Election officials anticipated a turnout of 90 percent or better of the 2.32 million Uruguayans eligible to vote. Radio stations reported that 21 percent had voted by 11 a.m. In the last elections in 1984, the main issue was who could best lead <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> back to democracy after a 12-year military regime that trampled human rights, stifled political opposition and ran the economy to the ground. <PERSON> Batlle </PERSON>'s great-uncle, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Batlle </PERSON> y <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON>, forged modern <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> during his presidencies in 1903-07 and 1911-15. Using huge surpluses from beef and grain exports, <PERSON> Batlle </PERSON> y <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> established the 8-hour work day, a minimum wage, retirement pensions and paid vacations. <PERSON> Batlle </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Batlle </PERSON> <PERSON> Berres </PERSON>, used reserves built up during World War II to promote local industry by blocking imports during his 1947-51 presidency. He also expanded social programs. Today, public education through college is free. The state provides mortgages and insurance as well as pensions, runs the banking system and employs 270,000 Uruguayans, or about one-quarter of the work force. However, salaries are so low that teachers, bus drivers and others frequently go on strike, retirees can hardly live on their pensions, and the quality of public services has declined. Teachers earn about 84,000 pesos -LRB- $ 110 -RRB- a month. The gross national product, now $ 8 billion, and real wages recovered modestly under <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>. But inflation, now at 82.5 percent, did not. Unemployment, at 14 percent in 1985, is down to 9 percent. <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Batlle </PERSON> pledged to reduce inflation, balance the national budget, sell gold reserves and pay off some of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s $ 6.3 billion foreign debt, and sell inefficient public companies They also pledged to open the economy, encourage competition through deregulation, and restrict the right of organized labor to strike. <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON> took the lead in public opinion surveys, analysts said, partly because he convinced voters he would seek solutions gradually on the basis of negotiation, not right away or by force. <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s aging, politically conservative population includes 650,000 retirees. A majority of voters are 40 years old or more. <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON>, a 48-year-old attorney and senator and a member of a prominent political family, pledged to form a coalition government and said he would offer Cabinet posts to leaders of other parties. The new president takes office March 1, 1990, and <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> and the departmental governments begin Feb. 15.

<HEAD>Food Prices Expected to Rise Again Next Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Food prices will go up again in 1990 but farm exports probably wo n't. Crop production may equal or exceed this year's output, but that will depend on the weather. It's forecasting time at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> when hundreds of bureaucrats, economists, consultants, researchers, commodity traders, bankers, food processors and even a few farmers gather to hear the latest predictions. Many foreign governments, notably the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and members of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> also watch the annual conference for tidbits that may help their agricultural trade fortunes. The department's 66th annual conference, Outlook'90, will run from noon Tuesday to noon Thursday. During that time, dozens of general sessions and individual meetings will cover the overall international and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domestic situation, plus separate sessions for various commodities and other topics. Much of the outlook for 1990 already has been described in general terms by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> analysts in recent reports. For example, consumer food prices, which rose 4.1 percent in 1988, probably climbed about 6 percent this year, the sharpest annual increase since 1981. Analysts have been saying the 1990 increase wo n't be that sharp _ if there is normal weather. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> also reports that agricultural exports, which provide much of the financial base for farmers, did well in 1989, reaching almost $ 40 billion, the most since the record $ 43.8 billion in 1981. But exports in 1990? Department analysts have been saying those will be down because of lower prices and reduced volumes expected for some key commodities. The net cash income of farmers rose to record levels in recent years, peaking at $ 59.9 billion in 1988. This is the money farmers have left over in a calendar year after deducting cash expenses from gross cash income. However, 1989 net cash income will drop to a range of $ 52 billion to $ 57 billion, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists. That reflects greater expenses from more cropland being put back into production this year, along with sharp declines in government payments. The outlook for 1990 farm income will depend greatly on national and international weather and crop situations, particularly for wheat, soybeans and feed grains. Livestock expansion _ or contraction _ also will reflect crops and markets. Thus, the conference will attempt to fill in many of the gaps concerning the supply and demand for commodities in the coming year. But those are n't the only concerns. `` Conditions affecting farmers and rural Americans will be an important focus of Outlook'90, with such topics as farm finance, new action on rural development, rural transportation policy, the well-being of rural families and children, and housing for older farm workers,'' organizers said. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> will keynote the conference on Tuesday afternoon and will participate in discussions on the federal budget, national economy and the financial health of agriculture. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>, chairman of the department's world agricultural outlook board, will review the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and world outlook for agriculture. Various commodity briefings and discussions are scheduled for Wednesday, along with rural development and forestry. Another highlight will be <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s formal 1990 outlook for food prices by economist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The concluding meetings on Thursday morning will include sessions on dairy and farm financial prospects, and global trade policies. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> is scheduled to lead discussions on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade negotiations and how those are expected to affect American farmers.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, for years the No. 1 overseas buyer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain and other farm commodities, is turning into a lucrative market for pet food. An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report says Japanese pet food imports increased five-fold from 1984 to 1988, reaching a value of $ 173.8 million. And the report by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says the trend is expected to continue. The leading foreign suppliers are <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, with a 38 percent market share; <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, 27 percent; and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 24 percent. Overall, including domestic production, pet food sales in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are expected to double in the next five years, the report said. Total dog food sales were valued at $ 467.3 million in 1987; cat food, $ 359.3 million; fish food, $ 34.3 million; and bird seed, $ 9.8 million. `` Many new pet food products, especially upscale gourmet treats, have been introduced,'' the report said. `` The rapidly strengthening yen makes imports more price-competitive.'' Another factor has been the promotion by foreign pet food manufacturers, who have set up subsidiaries in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Also, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> eliminated all tariffs on pet food imports on April 1, 1989. Japanese pet owners traditionally relied on leftovers to feed their pets and have started buying products specifically made for pets only in recent years. `` By 1987, 30 percent of the pet owners in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> had purchased pet food,'' the report said. `` This compares with more than 70 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and most European countries.''

<HEAD>HUD Chief May Seek Line-Item Veto Test Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may get his chance to test whether courts will approve a line-item veto, if Housing Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has his way. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said Sunday he may ask the president to test a line-item veto on housing projects earmarked for funding by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over the administration's opposition. `` I am going to do everything I can to make sure that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does not earmark monies, including asking the president to perhaps test on a line-item veto those programs which heretofore have just been shoved down our throat by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press. The chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> did not say which specific programs would be involved. On Oct. 24, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was seeking legislation on which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could exercise a line-item veto _ and then allow the courts to decide whether he acted legally. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters at that time: `` We are looking for a vehicle that might be a suitable test case, but at this point we do n't have one.'' Congressional Democrats contend that under the Constitution, presidents do not have line-item veto authority, and they have vowed to challenge any such move by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in court. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was questioned about a $ 4.2 billion housing initiative which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced on Nov. 10. Unlike congressional housing proposals, the president's program _ called Home Ownership Opportunities for People Everywhere, or HOPE _ would not provide any money for new construction of low-income housing. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said the administration plan concentrates on promoting ownership because `` at the heart of the American experience and dream is the desire to own a home and we're going to do everything we can to reorganize <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> with an eye on giving people that chance.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> initiative would provide $ 728 million for the homeless _ to be equally matched by states, local government or private groups _ for housing and support services such as social and mental health programs. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials have estimated that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> currently has about 600,000 homeless people.

 Sens. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> bear more blame than three other senators accused with them of improperly intervening with regulators in connection with the <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a former top regulator says. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, on Sunday insisted that the five lawmakers improperly pressured him as a favor to <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> owner <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` They were asking me to withdraw a regulation for their friend,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. `` I said, ` We're not going to do that.''' Two congressional committees are investigating the failure of the <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, Calif.-based <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L, which is expected to cost the taxpayers up to $ 2.5 billion _ $ 50 for each American family, according to Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>. The five senators intervened with federal regulators in 1987 on behalf of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, who gave them a total of $ 1.3 million in campaign and other political funds. The other three are Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich.; and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>. All five senators have said they violated no law or rule of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and they have disputed <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s account of the 1987 But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> two weeks ago appointed an outside counsel to investigate charges that their intervention constituted a conflict of interest. Asked on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>'' whether any of the senators were `` more culpable than others,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said, `` Yes absolutely ... Senator <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, who made the proposal, who has continued to stonewall and deny it. And Senator <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>,'' who received $ 850,000 in corporate donations from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> for three voter registration projects he favored after the senators' two 1987 meetings with federal regulators. Meanwhile, <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, the nation's chief savings and loan regulator, acknowledged on the <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON> show that he made mistakes in connection with the massive <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L failure, but said he has no plan `` at this point'' to resign. Wall, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION>, said he believed that as congressional investigations proceed, `` time will indeed be kind to us.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said two weeks ago he had not ruled out replacing Wall. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> insisted on the <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON> show that they did nothing wrong in connection with the <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> case. `` Any implication that I have done something wrong in this case is just flat wrong, and I resent it with every fiber in my being,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said, `` It was a serious mistake on my part'' to have not immediately made reimbursements for trips taken on <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s corporate plane, but he insisted that inquiries eventually will clear him of any rule-breaking `` I did nothing that I would n't do for any major employer, or economic factor, in my state,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said. According to regulators, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s money _ in the form of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L deposits insured by the federal government _ was lost to an elaborate `` pyramid scheme'' of phony real estate and other deals by <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>.

 The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area's largest shopping mall says it goofed in allowing <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> to give kids a book that offers a rude awakening: <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> does n't exist. `` It's just so absurd, the irony of it,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, a nurse who took her 4-year-old son, <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>, to visit <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nick </LOCATION> last week at <ORGANIZATION> Tysons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` Here's <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> handing out the one thing saying he does n't exist.'' After at least one mother complained, officials at <ORGANIZATION> Tysons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> pulled the book `` A Pee Wee Christmas'' from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>'s sack and replaced it with stickers and fingerprinting kits. `` What can I say?'' Tysons General Manager <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. `` We screwed up.'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said mall officials had screened more than a dozen books looking for an appropriate one, but somehow missed the subplot that says <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> is n't real. One of a series about a group of children called the `` Pee Wee Scouts,'' the book relates the tale of a 7-year-old named <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> who is ridiculed by his friends because he says he believes in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>. But by the story's end, the boy admits he knows the chubby man with the white beard and red suit is a fake. Author <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Delton </PERSON>, who said her series has sold more than 2 million copies, told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> the book was meant for 7 - and 8-year-olds and was not intended for a mall <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> to give away to younger children Last year, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> noted, dentists objected to the candy canes <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> gave to youngsters. `` You try to pick something that's noncontroversial,'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. `` Sometimes you just ca n't win.''

 Some top performers of the folk music boom returned to the <ORGANIZATION> Caffe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lena </ORGANIZATION> to play a few tunes in memory of the owner of the coffeehouse that helped launch their careers. The memorial Sunday included performances by <PERSON> Loudon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rosalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorrells </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronk </PERSON>. The music was filmed for a documentary about the folk music shrine and its founder, <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, who died Oct. 23 at age 66 from injuries sustained in a fall. The one-hour documentary for the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> will memorialize a `` driving force in folk music,'' said director <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Trombley </PERSON>, who grew up in nearby <LOCATION> Ballston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spa </LOCATION> and now lives in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> coffeehouse helped launch <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>'s career and featured <PERSON> Arlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON> Among the performers Sunday was <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Landron </PERSON>, the first musician to play at <LOCATION> Caffe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lena </LOCATION> when it opened in 1960. Landron dedicated a song called `` A Little Traveling Music'' to <LOCATION> Spencer </LOCATION> because, he said, `` some of us think of death as a journey.'' Such a lasting folk club `` had to happen somewhere and could n't have happened just anywhere,'' <PERSON> Trombley </PERSON> said `` A lot of places would n't have accepted <PERSON> Lena </PERSON>. ... <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> is a wacky town and one of the few places it could have happened.'' <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavin </PERSON>, who worked as a waitress at <ORGANIZATION> Caffe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lena </ORGANIZATION> in the mid-1970s, said <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>'s encouragement made her stick with her music career. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> occasionally thrust <PERSON> Lavin </PERSON> on stage to build her confidence, she said. `` <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> thought I had talent and wanted to give me a chance,'' said <PERSON> Lavin </PERSON>, whose performance at the memorial included a baton-twirling drill. `` When I twirled here <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> was a nervous wreck because she did n't have a lot of extra microphones,'' <PERSON> Lavin </PERSON> said. `` But I convinced her I had enough control'' not to smash the mikes. Blues artist <PERSON> Rory </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON> said she was thankful <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> never let business interfere with who she booked at the club. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> let Block play in the early 1980s, when she was n't a big enough draw to fill the tiny coffeehouse, she said. `` I never had a financial arrangement with <PERSON> Lena </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Block </PERSON>, who now has five albums behind her. `` At the end of the night, whatever she paid me, she paid me. And she paid performers every penny she could afford and probably a little more.''

<TEXT>
 Accusing <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> of sending surface-to-air missiles to leftist rebels, the rightist government has suspended diplomatic and commercial ties with its Central American neighbor. President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> made the announcement in a televised address Sunday, a day after military authorities said they discovered two light planes in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> that were delivering shoulder-fired missiles to the rebels. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> denied involvement and suggested such an accusation could endanger regional peace. The Nicaraguan president, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, said it gave his people `` honor and pride'' that a government `` of assassins of priests and religious workers'' broke relations. He urged other countries to break ties with <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s U.S.-backed government until it has `` punished the assassins. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s was an apparent reference to the Nov. 16 massacre in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter at a university. Other Jesuits at the school say witnesses saw army troops enter the residence before the killings. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> has ordered an investigation into allegations the military was involved. The murders occurred in the heat of a rebel offensive that turned the capital into a combat zone and was the largest of the decade-old civil war. The government has accused church leaders of sympathizing with _ and even aiding _ the rebels. On Sunday, authorities arrested an American church worker and accused her of storing weapons. One of the planes that allegedly carried weapons from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> crashed Saturday in eastern <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and troops recovered mostly Soviet weapons, including 25 shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles. Three crewmen died, and the fourth committed suicide, authorities said. The other plane apparently had its cargo unloaded after landing in the southern part of the country and was torched by the crew, who fled. Photographers for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> news organizations who saw it Sunday said trenches dug near the plane were filled with burned debris. The three photographers were detained briefly Sunday for entering the area without government permission. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> told a news conference that relations with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government would remain suspended until <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> `` stops intervening in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'' or loses in national elections Feb. 25 In a statement issued in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the Nicaraguan government denied any connection with the two planes. It quoted Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> as saying: `` The Salvadoran government should think about the seriousness of the declarations and actions that the news media are attributing to them, and about the serious implications in the regional peace process.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> and three other Central American presidents in August signed agreements in <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, to demobilize the Nicaraguan Contra rebels by Dec. 5 and pledged to ban all aid to insurgents. Missiles and other weapons said to have been taken from the wreckage of the plane that crashed were displayed at <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s news conference Introduction of such missiles into the war by the rebels would threaten a key government advantage, control of the air. As <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> spoke, sounds of renewed fighting _ automatic weapons and exploding rockets _ could be heard after a pause of several days. Later, the military said in a statement that an army patrol had sighted a group of guerrillas near a power transformer on the northwest edge of the capital and helicopters and C-47 warplanes chased them as they fled up the slopes of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Volcano </LOCATION>. The aircraft rocketed and strafed the area for several hours. The arrested American was identified as <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Thomaston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. She is a representative of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminar </ORGANIZATION>, a San Antonio-based ecumenical group Maj. <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON>, an armed forces spokesman, said 40,000 rounds of ammunition for U.S.-made M-16 rifles, 40,000 rounds of of ammunition for Soviet-designed AK-47 rifles, 203 blocks of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> and 403 detonator-caps were found at Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s house during a 2 a.m. raid and at other locations he did not specify <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said the arms cache `` proves church involvement'' with the rebels. He did not elaborate. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blatz </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminar </ORGANIZATION>, said by telephone that Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> has been in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> since 1985. He called the accusations `` ridiculous'' and `` part of their -LRB- the government's -RRB- persecution of the churches. That's clear.'' More than a dozen churches and refugee centers have been raided by security forces since the rebels launched their offensive Nov. 11.

 <PERSON> Delonte </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> plopped on his headphones, deftly fingered the computer keyboard and gleefully watched as the screen exploded into brightly colored pictures and the machine `` talked'' about the day's reading lesson. For third-grader <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and many other students, the time spent in the computer laboratory is a favorite part of the school day. Yet regulations for the federal Chapter One program bar some of his schoolmates from using the same lab because their families are n't poor enough or there's not enough federal money to serve all the eligible children. Barring such use of computer equipment is `` a waste of material and community resources and it does n't help education in general,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, director of instructional support programs for Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, Md. `` The money could be stretched farther if you had the opportunity to say, ` well, if these computers are not being used for a certain part of the day, then other at-risk kids can use them,''' he said. The frustration felt by <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> and other educators made the Chapter One program a prime topic of discussion at this fall's national education summit `` Several states report that large numbers of computers purchased by federal funds are idle at nigh, while adult education classes that need them either do without or use scarce tax dollars to buy other equipment,'' said a statement signed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and representatives of the governors who attended the two-day event. The federal government spends about $ 4 billion a year on Chapter One, a program that provides remedial classes, teachers and equipment to help bring educationally disadvantaged children up to par. `` Clearly by every account Chapter One is one of the most effective federal programs,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, manager of congressional relations for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. But according to the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>, the number of students served in Chapter One fell from 7 million in 1980-81 to 5.7 million in 1988-89, while the number of children needing the extra help increased to 8.5 million. In Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, Chapter One provides an $ 8 million budget for about 8,100 eligible low-income students. The county has 104,000 students. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and about 246 other students at <ORGANIZATION> Langley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park-McCormick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> are Chapter One students. They scored poorly on academic tests and were identified as needing educational services to raise their achievement level. `` I'm glad to get the special attention,'' he says. `` The computer lab is one of the favorites,'' said <PERSON> Jeri </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who oversees the school's program. `` The students always want to know, ` Is today the day we go to the lab?''' Like most Chapter One schools, <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> Park-McCormick strictly follows the rules to identify students and to allow only designated children to use its equipment and remedial education material. That means that computers, other educational materials and even teachers and assistants can be used only by designated students, and sometimes are idle. <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> <PERSON> Park-McCormick </PERSON> has been able to leap over some of the regulation hurdles. `` In a school as large as <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> Park-McCormick'' with a total student body of 681, `` we have such a large population of Chapter One kids, that we are not as affected as other schools,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> is one of only two elementary schools in the county to be equipped with a state-of-the-art <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> computer laboratory _ 20 terminals _ for Chapter One children. Last year, <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> <PERSON> Park-McCormick </PERSON> won special permission to use the computer lab, which was made for the county and is connected into one main computer, for an evening class of English as a second language. Six hundred adults enrolled.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> the Red-Nosed Reindeer, who turns 50 this year, saved more than just Christmas when he pulled <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>'s sleigh by the light of his famous snout. He saved his creator, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, from financial ruin, May's daughter recalls. `` My father said that <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> was the only reindeer in history that kept the wolf from the door,'' said <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Herz </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Novato </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` It was definitely the highlight of his life.'' May was an advertising copywriter for <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> when he invented the little reindeer _ originally called <PERSON> Rollo </PERSON> _ as a promotional gimmick in 1939. The store handed out millions of copies of the story annually until the paper shortages of World War II. It reintroduced <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> in 1946, but gave up the copyright to May the following January, his daughter said. It proved a turning point for the May family fortunes. May had the story commercially published with some success in 1947, and it was released in 1948 as a 9-minute theatrical cartoon. But it was in 1949 that <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> really took flight, when songwriter <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>, married to <PERSON> May </PERSON>'s sister, put <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>'s story to music and it was recorded by <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Autry </PERSON> `` From what I hear, it was <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Autry </PERSON>'s wife who really liked the song a lot and encouraged him to sing it,'' <PERSON> Herz </PERSON> said. The song sold millions of copies during the 1949 Christmas season, she said. In 1974, it became the basis for an animated television special. <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>'s popularity translated to concrete gains for the Mays, <PERSON> Herz </PERSON> said. The family was able to move from a small apartment to a four-bedroom house _ `` the house that <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> built,'' May would joke _ and the copyright residuals paid for college for May's six children. The copyright now is held by a company formed by May's children and managed by <PERSON> Herz </PERSON>. Before his death in 1976, May donated his original manuscript and the original pencil illustrations to <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, which he attended. His children donated their collection of <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> memorabilia to the school's <LOCATION> Baker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Library </LOCATION>, where it is displayed annually. The display features a larger-than-life-size <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> statue that once graced the May lawn in suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` People would drive by and show their kids, ` There's <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>,''' <PERSON> Herz </PERSON> said. For <PERSON> Herz </PERSON>, sharing childhood with the world's most famous reindeer provided an interesting juxtaposition of real life and fantasy. `` Right after the song came out and <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> was still in his heyday, I was still believing in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> definitely existed for me. I just thought my father wrote a story about him. It was kind of a unique experience.'' The <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> bonanza gave May a feeling of accomplishment he had n't experienced before, she said. `` Being in the <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> ad department all those years was n't really that exciting,'' she said. `` It was a real gift in the whole way that Wards had given it back to him, so it brought him a lot of joy.'' May `` was kind of an underdog,'' <PERSON> Herz </PERSON> said, hence his story of the reindeer that gets called names and refused entry into reindeer games. `` In a way, <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> is almost his story,'' she said.

Despite the flap, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> does not plan to curb his interest in politics, said publicist <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarem </PERSON>. `` Probably from a political point of view, there is a question in peoples' minds about what <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> should or should not be doing in politics,'' <PERSON> Zarem </PERSON> said. `` But <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>'s a smart man. He's interested in what happens to our country and what happens to our city. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> met Specter at President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inauguration last January, according to <PERSON> Zarem </PERSON>. In July, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> stopped by <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>'s office for a seminar on the Old Testament and the Torah. <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> has been holding the readings on Wednesday afternoons for four years, under the leadership of Biblical scholar <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON>.

The lunch is partly designed by <PERSON> Zarem </PERSON> to return a favor, <PERSON> Zarem </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> said he helped <PERSON> Zarem </PERSON>, a long-time baseball fan, meet <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phillies </ORGANIZATION> outfielder <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Dykstra </PERSON> over the summer. <PERSON> Zarem </PERSON> said he wanted to reciprocate.

 An argument in a prison cafeteria led to a riot that spread through two cellbocks and left eight guards hospitalized, authorities said. Sunday evening's disturbance at the maximum security Powhatan Correctional Center, about 25 miles west of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, was declared under control within three hours.

An assistant warden who tried to talk to inmates during the fight was beaten up but did not require treatment, said prison spokesman <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>. Three prisoners who allegedly took part in the riot were placed in solitary confinement. No inmates were injured, officials said. Officials said about 100 prisoners were in the cafeteria where the disturbance started and spread to two nearby cellblocks that house from 200 to 300 inmates. There are about 600 inmates at the prison.

 Hours after Communist authorities released him from jail, <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruml </PERSON> found himself on a frigid, wind-swept podium, speaking to 300,000 Czechoslovaks who share his desire for democratic reform. `` I had dinner in <LOCATION> Ruzyne </LOCATION> last night,'' the underground publisher told the rally, referring to the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> jail where he was imprisoned until his Saturday night. `` It was n't the hotel,'' he added, noting a nearby hotel of the same name. A chant rose from thousands at the joyous rally: `` What did you have?'' <PERSON> Ruml </PERSON> smiled. `` Mine was good. Since I'm on a diet, it was cherry cake and coffee,'' he said as laughter swelled from the throng. `` Let them -LRB- Communist leaders -RRB- eat that cake,'' the crowd chanted. `` Cherry cake at the castle, put <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> on a diet,'' the demonstrators roared in an acerbic reference to the overweight <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> hard-liner who resigned as <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s party boss Saturday and was dumped from the ruling Politburo today <PERSON> Ruml </PERSON> joined other singers and speakers from the Czechoslovak underground _ many banned from performances for two decades _ who found their public voices again Sunday at the festive rally. They were recognized by the masses, who remembered their works and recited their lyrics despite all official efforts at enforced forgetting. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, the leader of the failed <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring refoms of 1968, received jubilant applause throughout his speech although many listeners admitted being baffled by his thick Slovak accent and his use of language heavily laden with Communist jargon. The crowd roared in approval as he called on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> to join <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in apologizing for participating in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion that crushed his reforms movement. `` Our people want the truth without delay, and that should be one of the first steps of the -LRB- new -RRB- Central Committee,'' he added to thunderous applause. Playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, whose works are banned from his country and who has spent more than three years in prison since 1979 for his opposition to Communist rule, also was cheered. A moment of silence settled over the elated throng when the Rev. <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Maly </PERSON> asked for a moment of silence for <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON>, a dissident who died in jail in 1988. As Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> appeared before the crowd, they chanted `` Adamec! Adamec!'' <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, introduced as a `` guest,'' was invited to address the the huge rally after an unprecedented dialogue with opposition leaders earlier in the day. His presence at the rally was a dramatic departure for the normally reclusive leadership, accustomed over decades to simply issuing orders by decree and to addressing crowds carefully choreographed to deliver shows of support. `` As I said on television last night, I will gladly explain my opinions and listen to anyone who wants to find a common language,'' <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said. `` Thank you, Thank you,'' the crowd roared in response. But the crowd's goodwill quickly turned sour when <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> urged the people to shorten a general strike set for today from two hours to two minutes. The plea, viewed as an attempt to render the strike meaningless, drew loud boos and whistles from the crowd.

<HEAD>Kansas Drug Tax More Prosecutor's Tool Than Revenue Raiser</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HANNA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drug dealers owe the state $ 33.3 million in unpaid taxes and penalties on their pot, cocaine and other illegal uppers and downers, and the <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has collected only $ 23,392.96. But officials say the tax on illegal drug sales does more than bring in revenue. It gives prosecutors an easy-to-prove charge that can mean a longer prison sentence or a better bargaining position when defendants want to plea bargain. Revenue chief <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolfs </PERSON>, whose office made the estimate of how much is owed, said his agency became more active in trying to collect taxes on illegal drugs earlier this year, after the 1987 law survived a legal challenge. He said it may collect $ 500,000 next year. `` The prosecutors are using it,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION>. `` Prosecutors, I think, take it very seriously, and I know law enforcement takes it very seriously.'' At least 18 other states have taxes of some kind on illegal drugs, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governments </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. And as of October, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, Massachussetts and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> were considering similar measures, according to the council Under the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> law, dealers are taxed $ 100 on each ounce of marijuana, $ 200 on each gram of cocaine or controlled substance sold by weight and $ 2,000 for 50 doses of drugs sold by dose, usually prescription drugs obtained illegally. The law provides that a dealer who pays the tax will get a tax stamp to put on his bags, bottles and vials. The stamps are plain 2-inch-square stickers, green for marijuana, blue for controlled substances sold by weight and red for controlled substances sold by dose. So far, only eight people have bought a total of 377 stamps worth a total of $ 4,155.50, and most of the buyers are probably stamp collectors, officials said. The state assesses people for taxes when it is notified of drug busts. It has made 291 such assessments since the law went into effect, and collected $ 19,237.46 in back taxes and penalties. The 1987 law prohibits the disclosure of the names of people who buy the stamps _ a provision designed to protect a person's right against self-incrimination. Dealers are liable for the tax and an equal amount in penalties, and can be sentenced up to five years in prison and fined another $ 10,000. `` The idea is to try to make it more costly to be in that business,'' said <PERSON> Rolfs </PERSON>, who co-sponsored the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> legislation. <PERSON> Rolfs </PERSON> said the amount collected is small because local and federal law enforcement agencies already have the right to seize property used in dealing drugs. <PERSON> Nola </PERSON> <PERSON> Foulston </PERSON>, a prosecutor in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, said some people caught dealing drugs do n't have much to seize. `` It's like squeezing blood out of a turnip sometimes,'' she said. Supporters of the law like to say that gangster <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> went to prison for tax evasion, not racketeering or murder. But some prosecutors only infrequently use the drug tax law in their cases. Ms. <PERSON> Foulston </PERSON> said her office had filed tax charges in about 20 of the 600 drug cases it has handled this year. Her office has three lawyers working on drug cases, she said, and they do n't have time to document and file tax charges each time someone is arrested. District Attorney <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomasic </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said he does n't use the law because most of the people he prosecutes in drug cases are small-time criminals `` It's not like they've got a big house we can seize, or a big car we can seize,'' he said. `` They end up with a court-appointed attorney.'' Last year, defendants in <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Osage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> challenged the law, saying that paying taxes for drugs would be tantamount to violating their right against self-incrimination, guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. Two state district court judges agreed. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the law as constitutional in March. The justices unanimously ruled that the law contained sufficient protections and labeled the defendants' fears `` merely trifling or imaginary hazards.'' According to the Council of State Governments, the other states with such taxes are <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>GOP Tide Still Rolling in Florida</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOUNT DORA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Book </PERSON>, long-time <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> activist and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegate at the 1988 national convention, has joined the Republican tide rolling across the state. `` I have to focus on what's real,'' <PERSON> Book </PERSON> said. `` I've gotten older and more conservative. I was a Democrat because I perceived that party to be the most effective party for what I wanted to accomplish. `` I am now a Republican for the same reason,'' said Book, a Harvard-educated politician who last month at age 30 was re-elected to his second two-year term without opposition. His central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> city has only about 7,000 residents,. But Book's switch last month was big news among politicians statewide because of his activity on a number of local, state and national Democratic groups. Such switches provide a big boost to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s goal of making <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> its first majority state in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> since Reconstruction, said state party Chairman <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>. `` Any time we get an elected official to switch, he usually has a following that stops and thinks,'' <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> said. Democrats are hoping to reverse that trend when they meet at a party convention this weekend in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. The 1980s have been filled with victories for Republicans in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. In 1980, there were 3,087,427 registered Democrats and 1,429,645 Republicans. As of two weeks ago, there were 3,063,673 Democrats and 2,298,005 Republicans. `` We're getting four out of every five new people who register,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> state spokesman <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. The 1988 elections were a new high-water mark. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> enjoyed his widest margin in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, Republican <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> picked up a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, two Republicans were elected to the state Cabinet for the first time, and the party gained three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House seats. Since then, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> switched parties, giving the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> a majority for the first time in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation. At least 40 state officeholders have changed parties. After Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>'s death at age 88, Republican <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> won a special election in August for the seat Pepper held for the Democrats since 1962. `` We continue to climb, and they're in an airplane in a tailspin they ca n't pull out of,'' <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> said. Next year's <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> elections will have far-reaching effects. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, struggling in the polls, will try to become the first two-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor in recent <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> history, while the party tries to cinch another post-Reconstruction first for the South: control of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The Republicans can do it if they win four new seats. The Legislature will draw new boundaries after the 1990 elections. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, one of the nation's fastest-growing states, will gain at least three congressional seats and possibly four after the 1990 census. <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>'s opposite number, Cuban-born attorney <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, said the Democrats can reverse the trend quickly by defeating <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> next year. `` We foresee there will be a halt and then a swing back in 1990 and 1991,'' <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> said. `` The governorship constitutes a very substantial advantage to a party when it comes to maintaining the focus of the people on party politics.'' The Democrats opposing <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> include <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, state Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, the recently impeached federal judge. Democratic leaders are trying to head off a divisive primary by rallying early behind <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a one-time Space Shuttle passenger they see as having the diverse appeal needed in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> has concentrated early on conservative Southern Democrats who have been voting Republican in statewide elections. The Democrats say they can win them back; Republicans say the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> registration majority exists on paper only. Divisiveness has hurt the Democrats, however. <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> himself won the party chairmanship in a tense backroom battle with former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, who narrowly lost the 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race to <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. Book said <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON>'s defeat of <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> was the final straw in his decision to switch parties. <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, a fiscal conservative with a pristine record on ethics, was clearly the best choice to get the party turned around, <PERSON> Book </PERSON> said. <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, now the state campaign chairman, said Democrats still represent the true beliefs of most Floridians. `` A lot of it is not ideology. They've been turning away because they think we've lost our vitality,'' <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index rose to its fourth consecutive record high closing today, while the dollar declined against the Japanese yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 397.06 points, or 1.09 percent, closing at 36,881.53. The previous record was 36,484.47, set Friday, when the index climbed 197.55 points. Dealers attributed the continued rise to stabilized external factors such as foreign exchange rates and prospects for lower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> recently lowered the nation's federal funds rate, a short-term lending rate between commercial banks `` Normally, trading on the last day of the month is inactive, but today it was different,'' said <PERSON> Yutaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoshino </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He said today's trading was very active as investors expected further rises in the index for their December transactions, which start Tuesday. Investors bought a wide variety of issues including steel, shipbuilding and trading house shares, <PERSON> Yoshino </PERSON> said. `` Recent democratization in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> also encouraged buying because many investors think such changes in the Eastern bloc will provide them more business opportunities,'' he said. An estimated 1 billion shares changed hands on the first section Monday, up from Friday's 900 million. In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 143.35 yen, down 0.45 yen from last Friday's 143.80-yen finish. It opened at 143.18 yen and ranged between 143.05 yen and 143.38 yen. Dollar-yen dealing was inactive in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, as trading was dominated by buying of the West German mark, said <PERSON> Minori </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> trader. The dollar opened lower in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> following a similar downswing overseas as market players sold dollars to buy the West German currency. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is expected to become a major beneficiary of the recent moves toward democracy and economic reform in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Shortly before the market closed, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may announce plans for a troop reduction in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but Ms. <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON> said it would have little impact on the market. In the past, market players have bought dollars on rumors of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms reductions. `` If you only look at the defense budget, the arms reduction -LRB- in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> -RRB- may improve the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit,'' Ms. <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON> said. `` But what are military personnel going to do after they return to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>? That may increase the unemployment rate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and that does not necessarily improve the situation.''

<HEAD>Grain Dealer to Close Elevator After 52 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANKAKEE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabideau </PERSON> saw horse-drawn wagons deliver grain to his downtown elevator, never required his customers to sign contracts, and occasionally loaned them money. After 52 years in the grain business, <PERSON> Rabideau </PERSON> has decided to retire and close his elevator. `` I'm 78. It's time to go,'' said <PERSON> Rabideau </PERSON>, who knows it wo n't be easy to leave `` It's rough.'' He glanced anxiously at his watch, reached for his old portable radio, and at precisely 1:50 p.m., turned it on. The announcer read the day's highs, lows and closing prices for corn, soybeans and wheat. <PERSON> Rabideau </PERSON> recorded the numbers in his ledger, as he has done for decades. The ritual soon will end _ perhaps as early as Dec. 1. When the last grain stored at the elevator has been sold, <PERSON> Rabideau </PERSON> will put the radio back on the corner of his desk, return the ledgers to the huge steel vault, and walk away. `` This elevator was built in 1918, so it was built for the horse and buggy,'' he said. <PERSON> Rabideau </PERSON> <PERSON> Grain </PERSON> is a rural island in downtown <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION>, a northwestern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> city of 100,000. When the elevator opened, it was perfect for the single grain wagons pulled by tractors or an occasional team of horses. `` It just was n't made for these 500-bushel trucks,'' said <PERSON> Rabideau </PERSON>. `` They ca n't get into the driveway very well, and the traffic right downtown is terrible.'' <PERSON> Rabideau </PERSON> was born on a farm near <LOCATION> Clifton </LOCATION> in 1911, but decided early that life on the land was not for him. `` There was no money in it, and way too much work,'' he said. He worked four years at a hospital, and attended <ORGANIZATION> Gallagher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for a year. It was <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> who sent him to see <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> at the grain elevator for a job. <PERSON> Rabideau </PERSON> was paid $ 15 a week. `` I tell that to people now and they think it just ca n't be so,'' he said. `` But ... working on the farm meant working for $ 10 or $ 15 a month.'' Buying and selling grain was only part of the business. `` We did grinding of corn and oats for dairy cattle, plus mixing hog and poultry feed,'' <PERSON> Rabideau </PERSON> recalled. In 1972, he bought the business from <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. His customers were his friends; a handshake was his bond. `` We made many contracts these past 52 years,'' said <PERSON> Rabideau </PERSON>. `` We never had one of them signed by any customer.'' Only twice in half a century did that cause a problem. `` Once in a while, some of our customers would need a few hundred dollars,'' said <PERSON> Rabideau </PERSON>. `` If we were in a position to help out, we would.'' Through the years, retired farmers have stopped in the elevator office to chat with <PERSON> Rabideau </PERSON> and other friends and neighbors. `` In the end, we were buying grain from their children and grandchildren,'' he said. Most of the grain delivered to <PERSON> Rabideau </PERSON> was sold to processors in the area. <PERSON> Rabideau </PERSON> will take some mementos with him _ the brass thermometer on the wall and his old brass grain probe. And, he will take something even more valuable. `` I've had, and still have, many fond memories of working with our farmers,'' he said. `` They're a grand bunch of honest and hard-working people.''

 Machinists were banned from picketing at the airport after strikers pelted cars with rocks and beat up an Eastern employee, authorities said. Seven strikers were arrested Sunday on charges of unlawful assembly when they refused to leave the area at the <LOCATION> Hartsfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Machinists involved in the strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> have set up a tent city on the airport grounds. The Eastern worker, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Almon </PERSON>, told police he was leaving a maintenance hangar after the shift change when strikers began throwing rocks at his car and smashed windows. <PERSON> Almon </PERSON> was attacked by about 15 men when he jumped from his car and yelled at about 300 strikers near the hangar, said police Officer C.W. Wood. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, assigned to guard the area, said he waded into the melee and rescued <PERSON> Almon </PERSON>, who was treated at a hospital for a dislocated finger. After the incident, police ordered all but 20 strikers out of the tent city, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Coates </PERSON>, airport operations spokesman. He said the 20 were allowed to remain to guard equipment at the encampment. One striker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union members were frustrated by the events of the past week, which included a decision by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots and flight attendants to end their walkout that began to show solidarity with the Machinists.

Entrepreneur <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who co-produced the 12-hour `` rock-a-thon'' concerts Sunday with public television station <ORGANIZATION> KQED </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to match up to $ 1 million in phoned-in pledges. That threshhold was crossed early today, several hours after the three-concert benefit ended. Music from the concerts in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> was broadcast on <ORGANIZATION> KQED </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> radio stations. Hope decided at the last minute to join the event. At first, the 86-year-old comedian joked from the television studio that it was hard for him to leave his golf game. Later, <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> was greeted by a wildly cheering crowd at the Cow Palace in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The concerts billed more than 45 acts, including vocalist <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> McFerrin </PERSON> and blues performer <PERSON> Taj </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahal </PERSON>, guitarists <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> and <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Chambers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, percussionist <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Escovedo </PERSON> and the Latino-rock group <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lobos </LOCATION>.

 The mother and friends of an American church activist arrested in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> denied the accusations of Salvadoran police that she had hidden explosives and ammunition for leftist guerrillas. `` <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> is working for the church,'' said <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, the mother of 28-year-old <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>. `` She is working to help the poor people.'' Salvadoran police on Sunday arrested Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> and seized a cache of ammunition they said was buried under her house in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Police briefly exhibited Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> for reporters Sunday, but she was not provided an opportunity to comment. Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Thomaston </LOCATION>, is a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminar </ORGANIZATION>, an ecumenical group based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, that provides tours of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to visiting Americans. Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., said he was assured by the Salvadoran ambassador in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, that Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> would not be harmed Maj. <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON>, an Salvadoran armed forces spokesman, said 40,000 rounds of ammunition for U.S.-made M-16 rifles, 40,000 rounds of ammunition for Soviet-designed AK-47 rifles, 203 blocks of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> and 403 detonator caps were found in Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s house and at other locations. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said the cache `` proves church involvement'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the guerrillas of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Salvadoran authorities said they were tipped off to the arms cache by a rebel deserter. Friends noted that Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s arrest came amid a wave of harassment and arrests of church workers of various denominations in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Six Jesuit priest-professors were slain Nov. 16 and witnesses said the military was involved. Since her 1983 graduation from <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> has worked with the church and the poor. After receiving her degree in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Latin American studies, she worked at a soup kitchen in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and taught English to refugees in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. In 1984, she taught adults to read and write in a village in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Four years ago, she went to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to organize tours for delegations from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, a friend from <ORGANIZATION> Thomaston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` She would take them around,'' she said. `` They would see government officials. They would go to refugee camps, the cooperatives they had down there. From the left to the right, she tried to give the delegations a real feel for what was going on in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.'' Another friend of Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, who once worked with her in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said she suspects the ammunition was planted by agents of the Salvadoran government. `` They're trying to frame her to justify the actions taken by the military against international church workers in the last two weeks,'' said the friend, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutterman </PERSON>. `` They're trying to imply that churches are responsible for the violence, which is ludicrous.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blatz </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminar </ORGANIZATION>, called the accusations against Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> `` part of their persecution of the churches. That's clear.'' At times family and friends have wanted Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> to return to <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> felt she had a calling among the people of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abbot </PERSON> said. `` She feels like she's really being helpful. That's where she was happy being,'' <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> said. `` Naturally, we're all worried about her.''

 City governments are willing to be soldiers in the battle against drugs but need more than just fighting words from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, mayors attending an annual conference said. Mayor <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday the federal government must do more to fight illegal drugs, viewed by Americans as the gravest problem facing the country. `` And yet, we've heard all the rhetoric, we heard -LRB- drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> make all the right analyses, and then the mountain labored and out came a mouse. There were no new resources, no new commitment to fight drugs,'' <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> said at the conference attended by 5,000 officials. `` The federal government needs to step in,'' said <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Royer </PERSON>. `` Give me a break about ` the federal government's money' _ just because they print it does n't mean they earn it. With such a large chunk of federal tax being funneled into defense, it is hard to get funding for local programs, <PERSON> Royer </PERSON> said. Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, said major cuts in military spending wo n't come soon, despite the improved relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the growing independence of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` A 5 percent cut in military spending may be realistic, but I do n't see a drastic dismantling of the military empire,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` We must wait and see if the changes are maintained. We were doing pretty well in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and all of a sudden they clamped down.'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the lack of federal resources to resolve domestic problems is rooted in the lack of decisive national leadership. `` The problem with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is that nobody will make a decision about anything,'' he said. <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON> said that inadequate public education is the root of the drug problem. `` Somehow, we have to get these kids as early as we can and teach them not to use drugs,'' he said. `` When I was elected in 1977, crack was not even in our vocabulary. Now, it is the symbol of a lost generation ... of people who are not safe on the streets,'' <PERSON> Royer </PERSON> said. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> canceled a scheduled address today due to a death in his family. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, secretary for <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, is scheduled to speak Tuesday.

 Former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said the Ethiopian government and Eritrean rebels invited former Tanzanian President <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyerere </PERSON> to help mediate talks to end 28 years of civil war. The accord marks the end of preliminary negotiations between the two sides that should lead to substantive talks to stop the war, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitution </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published today. The decision to invite <PERSON> Nyerere </PERSON> to join him as co-chairman of the main talks was the last of 12 items on the agenda for preliminary talks, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said during a diplomatic shuttle mission through <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. Although the preliminary talks in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> almost broke down twice, `` both sides got what they wanted by Saturday,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. All that remains is to name observers to the main talks, he said. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said it may be several weeks before a decision is made on the time and place of the talks because the government and <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> delegates must confer with leaders at home. Delegates from both sides agreed on most negotiating issues two months ago in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and resumed the talks in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> to conclude the preliminary talks, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he expects <PERSON> Nyerere </PERSON>, who has been traveling in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, to accept the invitation. `` He has indicated in the past that he would if the invitation came from both sides, and not just from me,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. While the negotiating teams took a break Sunday, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> flew through <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. He met for 90 minutes in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> with Sudanese President <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON>, whose government will begin preliminary peace talks with rebels in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> on Friday. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> helped arrange the talks to help end <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s civil war but will not be directly involved.

 The opposition claimed fraud in the northern state of <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION> after election officials impounded more than 1,000 apparently pre-marked ballots.

<TEXT>
 A man convicted of poaching more than 1,000 eggs of endangered sea turtles has filed an appeal that puts a new twist on an old question: What came first, the turtle or the egg? <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bivens </PERSON> was convicted in March of poaching 1,088 eggs. He was sentenced to 60 days in jail and fined $ 500, plus $ 100 for each egg taken from the beach on <LOCATION> Singer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The fine amounts to $ 109,300. In court documents, <PERSON> Bivens </PERSON>' attorney argued that the fine is illegal because state law allows a judge to levy a $ 100 fine `` per unit of marine life.''

<HEAD>Poll: Women's Movement Yes, Feminism No</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Most American women think the women's movement has made their lives better, yet only one in three consider themselves feminists, according to a poll. The poll of 1,000 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women, published in the Dec. 4 issue of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, found that 94 percent believe the women's movement has helped them become more independent, 86 percent credit it with giving them more control over their lives, and 82 percent think it is still improving their lives Yet 76 percent said they pay `` not very much'' or `` no'' attention to the women's movement. Analysts attribute these contradictory attitudes to the very success of the women's movement, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> says. `` Saying the women's movement is dead is like saying the cold war is dead,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilligan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> professor. `` No. No. It's over. It's won.'' Asked to select the most important goals for the women's movement today, respondents rated `` helping women balance work and family'' as the No 1 priority. Second was `` getting government funding for programs such as child care and maternity leave.'' The poll, conducted by <PERSON> Yankelovich </PERSON> <PERSON> Clancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON>, surveyed 1,000 women by phone on Oct. 23-25, and has a margin of error of plus or minus three percent, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> barred a student group from meeting on campus unless it reverses its support of women's right to choose abortion and to use contraception. The Women's Center at the Roman Catholic school can not be recognized as an official student group if it insists on advocating abortion rights and contraception, said university spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Marren </PERSON>. `` It's a freedom of speech issue _ the anti-choice position is clearly represented on campus,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandolfo </PERSON>, a Women's Center member He said the Women's Center was founded on campus in 1978 and had its constitution approved by the administration in 1982.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Near-blizzard conditions blew into the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> today from a storm that dumped up to 4 feet of snow from the Sierras to the <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>. So much snow fell in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> that a World Cup ski race was postponed. The snow delighted early-season recreational skiers but sent cars skidding off roads and into each other, prompted some avalanche warnings and caused power outages. Icy roads were blamed for car crashes that killed three people in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> on Sunday. Some schools were closed in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> today. Interstate highways and smaller roads were closed at times during the weekend, causing major traffic jams as Thanksgiving holiday travelers tried to return home. I-80 over Donner Summit at <LOCATION> Truckee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was closed for nearly 10 hours into early Sunday, and the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> reported traffic delays of three to four hours through the pass later in the day. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the storm dumped 13 inches of snow on Donner Summit on Friday and another 38 inches Saturday and early Sunday. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, World Cup officials determined that conditions were too dangerous for men's slalom races Sunday at <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which got nearly two feet of snow by nightfall. But the snow meant other ski areas were able to open. `` There's an awful lot of -LRB- snow -RRB- out there. It's a welcome sight,'' said <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, an Alta Ski Lift employee. <PERSON> Alta </PERSON> had 26 inches of snow by Sunday night. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avalanche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> issued an avalanche warning for the mountains around <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Provo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In addition to snow, the storm also yielded two funnel clouds and 50-60 mph winds in southern <LOCATION> Davis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, but authorities reported no damage or injuries. High winds also were blamed for power interruptions in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> on Sunday, three people died in crashes on icy roads, while passengers in about 1,000 cars and trucks on I-90 between <PERSON> Bozeman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> were stuck in a traffic jam 10 miles long, the state highway patrol said. The patrol temporarily closed the highway's westbound lanes. The storm moved east today, piling up heavy snow in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s northern and central mountains and in the western <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> `` Near blizzard conditions, that's what it's like in the western <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanberg </PERSON>, a meteorologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, said early today. `` It's gusting 50 mph, producing near zero visibility'' around <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Swanberg </PERSON> said. No snowfall estimates were available early today. `` It's hard to measure when it's blowing around like that,'' he said. Temperatures were expected to drop into the low teens and as many as 8 inches of snow were forecast for northwestern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. All <PERSON> Moorhead </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, schools canceled classes today after the area got four inches of snow during the night. Two - to 3-foot snowdrifts were common, said meteorologist <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordlund </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, N.D In the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, the storm dumped snow in most of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s mountains. Two of the state's largest ski resorts _ <ORGANIZATION> Timberline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hood </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bachelor </LOCATION> ski area in central <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> _ opened Sunday. `` If you open before Thanksgiving, that means a great year.

<HEAD>Report: Public Growing Complacent on AIDS Prevention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The public has become too complacent about educating people to prevent the spread of AIDS, according to a study that shows the gay community alone has taken the threat seriously. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS released today urges vigorous new educational programs to boost AIDS prevention, which the group says is hampered by continuing public misconceptions about the disease. `` A basic assumption for prevention methods has been to scare people to death and they'll change their behavior,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, the commission's director. `` AIDS prevention is much more complicated than that.'' The report says education has stemmed the spread of AIDS in the gay community. But it points to the growing number of adolescents and non-drug-using women infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, as evidence that educational efforts do not reach all those at risk. The report attacks what it labels 10 myths about AIDS, such as `` AIDS education for drug users is a waste of time and money because they are unconcerned about their health.'' Another myth, the report says, is that, `` If people are given accurate information, they will change their attitudes and behavior.'' For example, <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said, the dangers of smoking have been known for decades, but smoking has only begun to decrease in recent years. `` We do n't have that amount of time, or else we'll lose a tremendous amount of our young people,'' she said of the AIDS epidemic. The report offers facts and recommendations to counter commonly held misconceptions, as well as examples of successful education programs. The commission is a private, independent group that was formed in July 1987.

<TEXT>
 In defining his own vision of a communism that works, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has endorsed a `` humane'' socialism that he insists might even have to adopt traits of modern capitalism to stay relevant. `` In the hullabaloo of our constant confrontation with capitalism, we clearly underestimate the importance of much that has been done by humanity over the centuries,'' the Soviet president said in remarks published Sunday. `` The new face of socialism is its human face, this fully corresponds to the thought of <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda. `` Because its creation is the chief goal of restructuring, we can with full justification say we are building humanitarian socialism.'' He said achievements attained under capitalism, like `` equality of all before the law'' and general prosperity, should not be dismissed because of ideology. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also seemed to defend his reforms from charges they lack a clear blueprint, citing the precedent of Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>. `` There is a deep-seated belief that <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> supposedly had a completed program for the development of socialism in our country. But in fact he had no such completed program,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, the latest <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc country in political upheaval, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, the leader of the 1968 `` Prague Spring'' reform movement that was crushed by Soviet tanks, read <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s remarks as proof of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader's support for change in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. For Communists, the wording `` socialism with a human face'' is inseparably linked with <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has declared his support before for economic and social change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but by appropriating <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s words, he made his point dramatically Some in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> took <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s comments as a public admission that the 1968 invasion, which led to <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s overthrow, was a mistake. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has not yet renounced the invasion as it has the 1979 invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. As recently as last year, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> was vigorously defending the intervention in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> as necessary to block `` anti-socialist forces.'' Soviets also avoided any comparisons between what <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> tried to do and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. `` The difference is 20 years,'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> once said laconically. Pravda said the 2 -LCB- - page article was a synthesis of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s recent thoughts on the future of socialism and his own program for `` perestroika,'' or reconstruction of the economy and The Soviet leader's major theme seemed to be that socialism must modernize _ even adopt traits of capitalism if necessary _ or risk becoming irrelevant. He offered no quick answers but said the process would take years, `` into the 21st century.'' He defended the 1917 revolution that brought the Communists to power in the former Russian Empire as a `` world-historical breakthrough to the future,'' but said socialism has often been perverted since. `` For the sake of a wrongly understood collectivism, human individuality was ignored, the development of the personality was slowed,'' he said.

 Hardly anyone showed up at a Thanksgiving party for the poor but a food bank will distribute the hundreds of pounds of leftovers. Caterer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostik </PERSON> said he had hoped to serve at least 700 needy people at his banquet hall in this <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> suburb Thursday. Twenty-four showed up, fewer than the 35 volunteers who offered to help serve the food. After his plight was publicized, <PERSON> Kostik </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>, both 40, gave out food to about 80 people Friday but still had about 200 pounds of turkey, 210 pounds of potatoes, 60 cases of bulk corn and more than 200 pumpkin pies left. <PERSON> Kostik </PERSON> said his use of the word `` needy'' on the flyers may have discouraged some people in the neighborhood _ home to many unemployed former steelworkers and senior citizens _ from showing up. `` We do n't have a lot of street people in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` This is a quiet, depressed area with a population that is too proud to ask for help.'' <PERSON> Kostik </PERSON> said he mailed dozens of public service announcements about the feast, which cost him $ 1,000, to newspapers and television and radio stations, but apparently none were used. Volunteers posted flyers throughout the neighborhood, but that did n't help either. <PERSON> Kostick </PERSON> said he was disappointed at the turnout. `` I was left with a real empty feeling, but the media attention helped us _ after the fact,'' he said.

 Swiss voters rejected an attempt to abolish the country's army by the year 2000, but the measure won much more support than expected in what one pacifist called `` a slap in the face of the establishment.'' The government tried to put on a brave face after 1,052,218 voters, or 35.6 percent of those who cast ballots, voted in favor of the proposed constitutional amendment that stated simply `` <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> has no army.'' Opposed were 64.4 percent, 1,903,797. Voter turnout Sunday was 69 percent, the highest for a referendum since the 1971 measure that gave women the right to vote. The anti-army vote was well above the 30 percent predicted by polls. The government had urged voters to reject the proposal, saying a credible defense policy is vital to guarantee the country's independence and neutrality Defense Minister <PERSON> Kaspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiger </PERSON> said he would set up a panel to analyze criticisms voiced about the 625,000-strong army and attributed the strong anti-army vote to `` the relaxation of tension which happily dominates the international scene.'' Supporters were stunned. `` The result is unbelievable,'' said <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, spokesman for the coalition of pacifists and left-wing groups that collected the 100,000 signatures necessary to force the referendum. `` It is a slap in the face for the establishment.'' `` If 500,000 people can bring changes in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, then the high proportion of ` yes' votes should give the Swiss government food for thought,'' he said, referring to the pro-democracy movement in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, describing the vote as `` sensational,'' called for an examination of defense policies. As a priority, the law should be changed to allow conscientious objectors to perform civilian duties, a statement from the party said. <PERSON> Eugen </PERSON> <PERSON> Luethy </PERSON>, Chief of General Staff, admitted the size of the anti-army vote had `` exceeded his expectations'' but declared the result `` provided a continuing solid basis for the armed forces.'' The vote followed weeks of impassioned debate, rare in normally reserved <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Many Swiss were shocked that the country's centuries-old military tradition should be called into question by the proposal. Even though <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> has not fought in a foreign war since 1515, it can field more men per square mile than any other country in the world but <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> has more artillery pieces than neighboring <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and a fleet of battle tanks half that of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> says military defense costs $ 3.1 billion annually. Army opponents say costs are nearer $ 6.3 billion, taking into account salaries in defense-related areas and the cost to private-sector employers of releasing staff for the annual call-up. Currently, every Swiss man is required to do military service, starting with 17 weeks of basic training at age 20, followed by 13 call-ups of two to three weeks until age 50. In a bid to relieve pressure on the country's tight labor market, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> this year announced reforms to end military service at the age of 42 by 1995. Supporters of the army maintain that <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s defense tactics spared the country the horrors of involvement in World War II. Others argue that <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> stayed neutral because it curried <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s favor by supplying foreign exchange and arms to the Germans.

 The much-maligned donkey is making a comeback in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and other states, where ranchers know that coyotes keep their distance when the stubborn beasts are making asses of themselves. It's the `` deliberate'' disposition of the donkey, and the animal's innate dislike of canines, that makes it useful guarding goats and sheep against coyotes and other predators, said rancher <PERSON> Nanci </PERSON> <PERSON> Falley </PERSON>. State officials say the donkey guard, an old-time form of protection, is enjoying a resurgence on ranches around the country. `` It's such a natural thing for a donkey,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Falley </PERSON>, who also sells the guard animals. `` It's not something that requires training. They have a natural instinct to run dogs and coyotes out of their territory.'' A well-placed kick from an angry donkey _ also known as the burro, or ass _ is usually enough to drive away any predator, experts say. Ranchers have known this for years. But a new environmental consciousness has helped promote the use of predator controls like guard animals instead of poisons that can enter the food chain. The low price of the donkeys does n't hurt, either. Prices range from $ 75 to $ 135 for females and $ 20 to $ 60 for males. About 1,800 of the animals currently stand sentry on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ranches. Groups such as the Montana-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spotted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asses </ORGANIZATION> have been promoting the use of the animals in other states as well. The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> includes donkeys, as well as guard mules and llamas, in a comprehensive predator control program it launched in 1988. The program also employs traps, lights, sirens and propane cannons to frighten away coyotes and wild dogs. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> leads the nation in raising sheep, with 1.9 million, and angora goats, with 1.5 million. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> wool and mohair industries were worth a combined $ 66 million last year, officials said, but ranchers lost about $ 9 million worth of livestock to predators. Coyotes are blamed for more than half the damage. That's where the donkeys come in. Ranchers put a donkey out to forage with a herd. Soon the donkey `` adopts'' the flock as its own and begins defending it against coyotes and other canines. The best way to choose a guard donkey is to let the animal get acquainted with its herd, then introduce a dog into its pen to see if it repels the canine. `` If the mule or donkey shows aggressive behavior toward the dog, then you've got a good guard donkey,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Feild </PERSON>, predator management specialist for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Some ranchers report more success with jennies, or female donkeys, and geldings, neutered males. Some jacks, or intact males, are overly aggressive with their herds. But Ms. <PERSON> Falley </PERSON> has raised donkeys for 23 years and said she does n't believe good guarding is a sexually determined trait. `` I would say about 85 percent make real good guards,'' she said as she stood in a corral with donkeys <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hickory </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dandy </PERSON>. Though the donkey of fable is obstinate and stupid, Ms. <PERSON> Falley </PERSON>, an inspector for the American Donkey and <ORGANIZATION> Mule </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, characterizes the animals as wise and regal. `` They do n't hurry. They do things in their own time,'' she said, petting a month-old burro she calls `` Little Toot.'' Ms. <PERSON> Falley </PERSON> said she began relying on donkeys to protect her goats and chickens after she moved to her ranch in <LOCATION> Lockhart </LOCATION>, northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, in the 1960s and found that predators considered her livestock `` groceries.''

 The Shiite Moslem extremist group <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> has established a network of operatives in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that may be preparing attacks against Western targets, a newspaper reported today. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> agents are active in the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and possibly other countries, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times reported, citing unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French officials. As Western intelligence agencies have focused on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> may have moved to create an alternative arms network in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as early as 1986, the newspaper said. French authorities believe a <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> cell played `` a prominent role'' in planting a bomb aboard a French airliner that exploded over <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> in September, killing 171 people. `` <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s reach now extends into <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> communities in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and it seeks to duplicate there what it did in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. The pro-Iran <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, has claimed responsibility for taking Western hostages and terrorist bombings in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. On Saturday, <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> police said a <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> cell had tried to smuggle 18 pounds of plastic explosives into <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, according to the newspaper. It said 10 people were arrested in a plot to attack targets in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In recent months, <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> officials have discovered security breaches at their embassies in <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> involving the sale of passports and intelligence cables to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> agents, the newspaper said. In the most serious incident, a French consular official in <LOCATION> Conakry </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, provided 100 identity cards and 60 passports to a Shiite cell, the Times said. The scheme surfaced when a Lebanese national carrying one of the passports blew himself up with a homemade bomb in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> last summer, French diplomats told the newspaper. In <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, officials reportedly caught a French embassy employee selling French identity cards to another group of Lebanese. And in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, where the doomed UTA French airline flight originated, a security breach involved stolen diplomatic cables, the newspaper said. Most of the French consular officials involved were contract workers who had served in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> or had Lebanese connections, French officials said. Several were arrested. `` We do n't believe the cells are being created to destabilize the countries they are in,'' said a French official. `` But all these countries offer bases for operations against the West. `` They are in the courtyard of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. And security is notoriously lax in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' the official said. Intelligence officials suspect the agents operate among tens of thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> emigres who work in the region. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> there was no evidence that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has sponsored the implantation of the cells.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Christian army commander <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> today rejected a 48-hour ultimatum by the new president and said he would `` die fighting for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s honor.'' Military sources denied reports that Gen. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s force and President <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s backers were massing troops. `` There is absolutely no move on the ground to suggest that a collision is imminent. The fronts are as they have been since the -LRB- Sept. 22 -RRB- cease-fire,'' one ranking officer said on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, in an interview on French television, said, `` I shall defend myself and the free -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- areas to the last man. I shall be in the forward lines of my troops and shall die fighting for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s honor.'' `` I do not recognize Mr. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>. His election under Syrian occupation is unconstitutional,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said. The interview are also broadcast by Christian radio stations. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, elected by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Friday to replace assassinated leader <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, told reporters Sunday he would not permit the existence of two rival governments in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and said he would replace <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> as army commander within 48 hours. `` If he stays ... I must say with much regret that he will have to bear the consequences,'' <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> said at his temporary headquarters in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Syrian-controlled <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> valley town of <LOCATION> Chtoura </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, 64, sacked <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> as head of an interim military Cabinet on Saturday. But the measure was a mere formality because <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> still controls the military and has ignored the order. `` He still is general of the army, perhaps for no more than 48 hours, after which, if he stays, he will become an officer of this army,'' <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> pledged to rule from the traditional seat of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Maronite heads of state in suburban <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has set up his command in the bunker of the shell-battered presidential palace <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> are both Maronites. `` Whatever is left of <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, even if it is one room, when his situation is over, it will be my residence,'' <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> said. That touched off reports that an attack was imminent and that the Syrian army was moving in reinforcements to evict <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> from the hilltop <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> palace, five miles east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Christian and Moslem military sources reported no troop movement. A cease-fire called by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> Sept. 22 halted six months of savage artillery battles across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 troops and the Syrian army, killing at least 930 people by police count <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s aides say he is counting on the appointment of a new army commander to shake the troops' loyalty to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has rejected an Arab League-brokered peace plan approved by <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s parliament in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> last month because it fails to provide for a total Syrian withdrawal from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> maintains 40,000 troops controlling 70 percent of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> contends the Syrians have become an occupying force because they sided with the Moslems in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. The Taif accord, which <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> has pledged to carry out, provides for a phased <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> pullout from major cities to redeploy in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> within two years and gives Moslems an equal share of power with the long-dominant <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> minority.

 Uruguayans chose <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON> as president in hopes his opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would reverse three decades of economic decline in this once-rich South American nation. In <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>, a Marxist doctor easily defeated all rivals to become mayor of the country's capital and largest city. Eight hours after polls closed Sunday, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> had issued tallies from more than half of the 8,493 voting districts that gave Sen. <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON> a comfortable lead. <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON>, who will take office March 1, has pledged to work with people of all political stripes in reforming <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s state-dominated economy and easing its foreign debt burden He pledged to build a governing coalition. On the basis of party and independent tallies, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Batlle </PERSON> of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ the son and grand-nephew of presidents _ acknowledged his bid had failed. `` The future president will be Sen. <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON>, to whom I offer my most sincere congratulations and best wishes for success in his term,'' said <PERSON> Batlle </PERSON>, a 62-year-old senator who ran unsuccessfully for president in 1966 and 1971. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> received 430,846 votes, or 39.8 percent, compared with 325,879 or 30.7 percent, for the <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION>. The leftist <ORGANIZATION> Broad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION> finished third with 168,830 votes. The rest of the vote was split among six smaller parties. About 2.32 million voters _ or 80 percent of those registered _ took part in the mandatory balloting, election officials said. <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON>, 48, in brief comments to reporters at his party's headquarters, said his would be a government of `` national unity. After accepting the congratulations of <ORGANIZATION> Broad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s presidential candidate, retired Gen. <PERSON> Liber </PERSON> <PERSON> Seregni </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON> said he would issue a public statement later today. <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON>'s party, which last held executive power in 1967, was expected to receive the biggest bloc but not a majority in the 30-seat <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and 99-member House of Deputies. In <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>, thousands of residents danced to bongo drums, set off firecrackers, waved banners and cruised in cars after <ORGANIZATION> Broad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Tabare </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> defeated all rivals to become mayor. `` Celebrate, neighbors, because the needy will be the most privileged,'' an exultant <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> told several thousand cheering supporters outside his party's headquarters. `` The mayoralty is the first step,'' said supporter <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martins </PERSON>, 37, a clothing wholesaler. `` The next step is national power. ... If we govern well here, the rest of the country will support us.'' In campaigning to replace President <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>, who was elected in November 1984 and took office in March 1985 to replace a military dictatorship, <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON> focused on <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s economy Under <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>, unemployment dropped from 14 percent to about 9 percent, and the deficit was halved to about 4.5 percent of gross national product. But inflation refused to go below 57 percent, payments on the $ 6.3 billion foreign debt cut sharply into public programs and standards of living continued to decline. `` I think we're the same as we were four years ago, and some people are worse off than before,'' said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Melo </PERSON>, a 26-year-old metalworker. `` When we look at the outside world, there have been tremendous advances,'' said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Larghero </PERSON>, 47, a graphic designer. `` The opposite has occurred here. We deteriorate a little bit each year.'' <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON> made no promises that <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> would soon take its place among the world's wealthier nations, as it was for the first half of this century. But he said inflation would decrease to 20 percent, exports would increase by 20 percent to $ 2 billion a year and unemployment would continue to decline throughout his five-year term. To resolve the foreign debt, <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON> proposed to sell some of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s 3 million ounces of gold reserves, and buy investments that would generate interest to help pay the debt. <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON> has pledged to sell inefficient public companies, cut federal bureaucracy and encourage foreign investment.

<BYLINE>No U.S. Withdrawals From Europe Before Arms Deal, Cheney Promises

<TEXT>
 Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops will be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> without a superpower agreement on conventional arms, the Dutch government said today. The comment followed news reports that quoted <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> as saying more troop reductions have been made possible by the continued `` erosion'' of the Soviet military threat in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He reportedly said this during his flight to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, who was scheduled to travel to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> for an annual meeting of <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers, was not immediately available for comment. The Dutch defense minister, Relus ter Beek, quoted <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> as saying he expected the Vienna-based talks on Conventional Forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to be followed by another round of disarmament negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. `` Withdrawal of ... American troops from the European continent will take place -LRB- only -RRB- after a -LRB- conventional arms -RRB- agreement,'' the Dutch official told reporters after meeting with <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> for several hours Sunday and today. <PERSON> Ter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beek </PERSON> said he was promised by <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s plans for cutting $ 150 billion to $ 180 billion over the next five years would not affect the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance before a conventional arms agreement is concluded The conventional arms talks are aimed at achieving parity between the number of troops deployed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said he expected further troop reductions once a conventional arms agreement is completed, probably some time next year, according to <PERSON> Ter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beek </PERSON>. A conventional arms agreement would include withdrawal of at least some of the 300,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as well as reductions in the number of soldiers and conventional weaponry being deployed by the other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. Most of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` We were very pleased to hear that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secretary also assumed ... an initial agreement in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> will be followed'' by another round of talks aimed at further conventional troop reductions, <PERSON> Ter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beek </PERSON> said. The Dutch official said he and <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> also discussed the swift movement for democratic change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, where demonstrations have resulted in the ouster of several hard-line Communist leaders. <PERSON> Ter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beek </PERSON> said the two agreed on the need for `` full support for perestroika,'' <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of restructuring the Soviet political and economic system.

<TEXT>
 Sirens howled and church bells rang today as millions of people observed a nationwide general strike and filled streets and city squares in the largest demonstration so far against <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule. Wenceslas Square in central <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> was jammed with hundreds of thousands of flag-waving workers marching beneath the banners of their factories, firms and offices. `` We do n't want you anymore!'' the crowd roared in a chant that echoed off the high 19th-century buildings surrounding the square, a half-mile long boulevard. In a frenzied effort to avert the two-hour strike, seen as a referendum on demands for their ouster, the country's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders early today dumped three more hard-liners from the ruling Politburo. They feared the strike would draw workers to the pro-democracy movement, which was launched by students, intellectuals and artists. They also endorsed a `` dialogue'' with the opposition and agreed to a parliamentary inquiry of the brutal police crackdown on a peaceful student rally Nov. 17 that touched off the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's latest popular revolt And the state news agency said the government had lifted most forms of censorship. The concessions followed unprecedented talks Sunday between opposition leaders and Communist premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, who later joined reformer <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> at the head of a rally and told about 300,000 demonstrators that authorities were ready to listen to their demands. Demands for free elections and an end to one-party rule were plastered over the windows of shops, hotels and restaurants that shut down for the strike, which began at noon -LRB- 6 a.m. EST -RRB-. State-run television, which has played a key role in the dizzyingly rapid popular revolt here, broadcast footage from industrial centers around the country, showing crowds of hundreds of thousands attending strike rallies. At the largest enterprise in the Slovak capital, <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, the company's radio even issued instructions on how to go about the strike, television said. Huge crowds of strikers were seen in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, the east Slovak industrial center of <LOCATION> Kosice </LOCATION>, the mining center of <LOCATION> Ostrava </LOCATION> on the Polish border, and in <LOCATION> Usti </LOCATION> <LOCATION> nad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Labem </LOCATION>, the heart of industrial north <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION>. There was no estimate of how many workers went on strike, but the television footage and the crowds in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> suggested the strike was a major success for the opposition. State radio said all enterprises were affected, although most had skeleton crews on duty so production would not be completely disrupted. `` It has to go to the very end,'' said <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Cervenkova </PERSON>, one of those protesting on Wenceslas Square. `` As long as the Communists rule, it is going to be as messed up as it was for the last 40 years.'' `` Look <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON>, how thick the crowd is!'' the masses chanted, referring to President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, who headed the crackdown on democratic reforms that <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> tried to institute in 1968. `` Dubcek to the Castle!'' they yelled, referring to the presidential residence. <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> in 1969. Sirens wailed and church bells pealed across the land at noon to signal the start of the strike. People jangled keys and rang little bells of their own in a symbolic signal to the Communists that their time in power is up. `` The last bell is ringing, the fairy tale is over!'' they chanted. A radio announcer called the strike `` the highest form of ... struggle'' for democracy and said it had been made necessary because `` of the mistakes of the regime.'' Later, a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that initiated the protest proclaimed on the radio that protests, which began 11 days ago, would continue until a clause enshrining the Communists' leading role is struck from the constitution. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> is the latest <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc country to be caught up in the reforms avocated by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The mass protests began nearly two weeks ago and have resulted in the ouster of a number of leaders, including <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> State television announced it reduced its workforce for today's strike, and the foreign language service of the <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported it would stop transmission for 15 minutes in a symbolic gesture of solidarity Radio carried interviews from numerous factories, hospitals and enterprises with officials also expressing their solidarity. `` I waited, like you, a long time for this,'' <PERSON> Valter </PERSON> <PERSON> Komarek </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Forecasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, told workers at the Vysocany plant in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. Removed today from the Politburo were <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON>, who resigned as <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> party boss Saturday, trade union boss <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavadil </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenart </PERSON>, the longest-serving Politburo member. Their ouster and the addition of seven, largely unknown Politburo members left an untried 13-man ruling party body whose longest serving member, Slovak party chief <PERSON> Ignac </PERSON> <PERSON> Janak </PERSON>, joined in April 1988. On Friday, seven Politburo members were ousted, but activists had demanded further personnel changes and have expressed skepticism the new Politburo is willing to bow to demands that the Communists relinquish power. New party chief <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> is one of just three on the 13-member Politburo to have survived the recent shake-ups. On Sunday night, he pledged for the first time to open a dialogue with all levels of society _ including opposition groups and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members ousted after <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s failed reform movement.

 Surgeons today undertook the nation's first liver transplant from a living donor _ a mother who's giving a third of her liver to her 21-month-old daughter. If successful, the operation at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> would provide a solution to a severe shortage of organs for children who need transplants, doctors said. More than 700 babies a year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> need liver transplants, and as many as half die for lack of a donor. <PERSON> Teri </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 29, was rolled into surgery at 7:35 a.m. to begin the operation in which the left lobe of her liver was to be transplanted in her daughter, <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON>, said a spokeswoman at Wyler Children's Hospital at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. `` She was as eager to get started as she was a month ago when we first proposed this to her,'' hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fetsch </PERSON> said today. `` She has not displayed any signs of doubt or hesitation.'' Dr. <PERSON> Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> Broelsch </PERSON> led the surgical team in a two-phase operation that began with removal of a portion of Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s liver, said Ms. <PERSON> Fetsch </PERSON> About 3 -LCB- hours into the mother's operation, doctors planned to prepare her daughter for the transplant. The entire procedure was expected to last eight to nine hours. `` In a way I kind of fear for her, but I'm confident everything will turn out OK,'' said <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 27, of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Shertz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> suffers from an often-fatal liver disorder called biliary atresia. The disease blocks liver bile ducts, backing up bile in the bloodstream and the liver, and is the leading cause for liver transplants involving children. Until now, the only regularly performed living donor transplants have involved kidneys and some pancreas segments. Liver transplants from living donors have been performed only three times _ in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. One child has died. In those cases, the operation were emergencies performed on critically ill children, said Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitington </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>'s pediatric liver transplant program. The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> hospital has spent more than a year planning the program, and last August authorized 20 such operations to determine if the procedure is viable. Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paine </PERSON>, who directs the liver transplant program at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said transplant specialists around the country were closely monitoring today's operation. Because cadaver livers are usually from adults, they are too large to be transplanted into children's small abdominal cavities. `` Small children are at risk of dying while waiting for a suitable cadaver donor,'' said <PERSON> Whitington </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> had been waiting for a cadaver liver transplant for more than a year when the Smiths heard about the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>'s plans for the experimental program in August `` It's a waiting game when you are waiting for a liver,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a fourth-grade teacher. `` You do n't know if she's going to have a bout with some illness that causes her to go into a liver failure and a liver not be available at that time.'' The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> hospital has been a pioneer in liver transplants. <PERSON> Broelsch </PERSON> became the first surgeon in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to transplant part of a liver from a cadaver into a child in 1986. Last year, he performed a `` two-for-one'' operation, in which two children received transplants from one cadaver liver. <PERSON> Whitington </PERSON> said the living donor transplant `` is just the next step in assuring a steady supply of liver grafts.'' He said the procedure holds the promise of a lower rejection rate since the grafts would come from a close relative, match better genetically and could be transplanted immediately. Also, the operation could be performed electively before a child becomes critically ill. Before authorizing the program, the university studied ethical considerations and decided that the risk to the donor was low, <PERSON> Whitington </PERSON> said The liver regenerates itself _ an adult liver will grow back to normal after the operation, and the segment transplanted into an infant will grow with the child. <PERSON> Whitington </PERSON> said the hospital's guidelines stress that no pressure be applied on family members to be donors. `` The only thing I wish is that they could say, ` Yes, this will work,''' said Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` There is a possibility it will not be a 100 percent success. But we realize her chances should be better.''

 <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> law enforcement officials sued for strip-searching a woman charged with operating her car without proper registration or insurance lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal today. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that strip-searching people accused of minor traffic violations generally violates their rights. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Masters </PERSON> pleaded not guilty Aug. 21, 1986, to driving her car with expired registration plates and failure to maintain auto insurance. She was ordered to return to court on Oct. 23 and was given a card to remind her of that date. By mistake, the judge recorded Mrs. Masters' next scheduled appearance as Oct. 16. <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police officers arrested Mrs. Masters at her home Oct. 21 for failure to appear in court on Oct. 16. After police dropped off her two young children with Mrs. Masters' mother, they handcuffed Mrs. Masters and took her to jail. A female attendant frisked her and ordered her to open her blouse in front of a window and in view of other people. About four hours later she was taken to another room where she was ordered by another female attendant to take off all her clothes for a more thorough search. After putting on a jail dress, Mrs. Masters was placed in a cell with other prisoners. She was not released until later that evening. Throughout her ordeal, Mrs. Masters repeatedly protested that her arrest was a mistake. She showed police her `` reminder card'' as evidence she had not failed to report for her court date. Mrs. Masters later sued four police officers and the head of the county corrections department for allegedly violating her rights. The law enforcement officials said they should be immune from such a suit, largely because of a 1985 court consent decree that settled an unrelated case involving overcrowding at the county jail. The decree authorized strip searches of inmates at the jail when they are transferred from one area to another. The 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last April rejected the county officials' arguments aimed at killing Mrs. Masters' suit. `` We have found no authority approving a practice of conducting a strip search of a person arrested for a simple traffic violation in the absence of at least reasonable suspicion that the person might be carrying a weapon, illegal drugs or other contraband,'' the appeals court said. The consent decree did not give the police power to ignore clearly established principles protecting rights of people accused of minor traffic offenses, the appeals court said. The case is <PERSON> Frey </PERSON> vs. Masters, 89-576.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> intensified its search this morning for five missing fishermen after a cutter and a jet spotted white flares in the area where the lobster boat disappeared. The men, aboard the 72-foot <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> out of <LOCATION> Stonington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, were reported missing Wednesday after they failed to call the boat's owner, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON>. The Coast Guard found fishing markers from the lobster boat Friday and identified an emergency floating radio beacon as belonging to the vessel. Petty Officer <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Brannan </PERSON> said the cutter spotted a white flare about midnight Sunday, prompting rescuers to launch a nighttime jet search about 200 miles south of <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION>. `` The jet sighted a flare, but ... while they were searching they were n't able to confirm the source before having to turn back to refuel,'' <PERSON> Brannan </PERSON> said. The hunt was stepped up early today and, in addition to the two cutters on the scene, it included five jets from as far away as <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> that would cover 8,400 square miles of ocean, she said. Petty Officer <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said it was not known if the flares were related to the missing vessel, adding that `` white flares are not generally considered distress flares, but we have to consider that they are.'' Officer <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> described Sunday's effort as a `` full-blown'' search, using <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> aircraft from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, as well as the two 270-foot cutters from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. There were no immediate plans end the search for the fishermen, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. `` We go as long as we feel there's reasonable hope,'' he said. Coast Guard officials have said there was still some reason to believe there could be survivors. The vessel was equipped with a high-quality inflatable covered life raft that held up to eight people. During the five days of searching, rescuers have used sophisticated equipment and special flare searches while criss-crossing 10,000 square miles of sea under mostly fair weather conditions and good visibility. <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON> declined comment Sunday through his attorney, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>. He has not yet spoken publicly about the incident, although his wife said he is in constant touch with the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. The crew members were identified as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>, Capt. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON>, 33; <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, all in their twenties, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said.

 There's a cold front bearing down on <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island where President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are going this weekend to warm up their relationship. It could rain on their sail, according to the weather forecast. Big-time summits at sea are like that. The last time there wa A lot of planning goes into such a meeting, but things still go wrong. The Churchill-Roosevelt meeting in <LOCATION> Placentia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in August of 1941, is an example. At that meeting, the two leaders drafted the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> Charter _ a policy of aid to <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> at a time when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was neither legally nor emotionally committed to full participation in the war against <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. It was the forerunner of many such other meetings between leaders. <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> brought not only a large delegation of military men to the meeting, but also 90 grouse. In the 1969 book `` The First Summit'' <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> writes that HMS Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> arrived at the meeting point with <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> and a band arrayed on the quarterdeck and everyone on board in place for welcoming ceremonies. `` The battleship made a sudden burn to starboard, and to everyone's surprise headed out to sea,'' wrote <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. There had been a mixup about time zones and the ship was 90 minutes too early. `` The prime minister was furious and banged about the main deck hunting a target for his wrath,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> wrote, but nothing could be done except to steam in a great circle. All of this was hidden in morning mist. `` Then dramatically, the mist broke to reveal a dazzling panorama,'' he continued. `` The camouflaged British warship, a White Ensign stirring over its stern, found itself in the midst of many other armed ships, of all sizes and shapes, all displaying the Stars and Stripes, their decks lined with cheering seamen. `` Overhead droned American patrol planes. On the deck of the British battleship their pilots could discern a pudgy figure in some kind of naval uniform. A <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> heavy cruiser just a short distance away bore on its quarterdeck another figure, sitting patiently in a wheelchair.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today left intact an <LOCATION> Overland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, ordinance restricting the ownership and possession of `` pit bull dogs.'' The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the city ordinance is unconstitutionally too vague. Lawyers for 13 owners of dogs told the justices the 1987 ordinance `` does not even attempt to offer a standard for the police or dog owners to use when trying to determine whether a particular dog is subject to the ordinance.'' `` Anti-pit bull laws and ordinances are now sweeping the country,'' the appeal said, `` and constitutional challenges on vagueness grounds have been mounted in dozens of counties and states, with inconsistent results. This ordinance is among the very worst offenders.'' The appeal said trial judges in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state have struck down anti-pit bull ordinances for being too vaguely worded. The Overland Park ordinance deems pit bull dogs `` dangerous animals'' that must be kept indoors or restrained and muzzled at all times. Pit bull dogs are defined by the ordinance to include <ORGANIZATION> Staffordshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terriers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staffordshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terriers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terriers </ORGANIZATION>, or dogs that `` have the appearance and characteristics of being predominantly of -LRB- those -RRB- breeds of dogs.'' The ordinance also requires pit bull owners to acquire a $ 50,000 liability insurance policy to compensate for any damage caused by the animals. Owners who fail to comply may be criminally liable, and could face substantial fines and up to 30 days in jail. A state judge and the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the ordinance. Noting in its ruling last April 4 that no constitutionally protected conduct is being limited, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the ordinance is worded precisely enough. `` The ordinance, as interpreted by the <ORGANIZATION> Overland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, applies only to animals in which pit bull dog characteristics predominate,'' the state court said. `` Ultimate, god-like precision is not required.'' In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the dog owners said the ordinance `` on its face lacks even a rudimentary core meaning.'' The case is <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> vs. Overland Park, 89-412.

The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the five were prosecuted fairly. Convicted of racketeering and related charges were <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Coonan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> Coonan </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bokun </PERSON>. Prosecutors described <PERSON> Coonan </PERSON> as the ringleader of an underworld group that terrorized the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> neighborhood for 20 years until the mid-1980s. <PERSON> Coonan </PERSON> was sentenced to 75 years in prison and fined $ 1 million; his wife received a 15-year sentence and $ 200,000 fine; <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON> was sentenced to 60 years, <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> to 40 years and <PERSON> Bokun </PERSON> to 50 years. The Westies were involved in murders, kidnapping, extortion, loansharking, gambling and drug distribution, the government said. Three victims were dismembered and their bodies dumped into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Coonan </PERSON> supervised the gang even while serving a prison sentence for murder. They said his wife ran the Westies' loansharking operation and relayed messages from the jailed <PERSON> Coonan </PERSON> to his subordinates <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON> was described as a chief enforcer, <PERSON> Bokun </PERSON> as a killer and cocaine dealer and <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> as a cocaine dealer and loanshark. In the appeal acted on today, the <PERSON> Coonans </PERSON> said they were convicted largely on the basis of hearsay and gossip. They said while <PERSON> Coonan </PERSON> was in prison other gang members falsely boasted they had committed crimes with him to intimidate victims. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said police illegally searched his apartment. <PERSON> Bokun </PERSON> said he was denied adequate legal representation after his attorney was forced to withdraw eight weeks into the trial because of illness. <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> Coonan </PERSON> said they were denied a fair trial because the judge barred a psychiatrist from testifying about the mental illness of a prosecution witness. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the convictions in May. The cases are <PERSON> Coonan </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 89-379; <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 89-5497; <LOCATION> Bokun </LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 89-5512; <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 89-5601.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected an appeal by a telephone company ordered to notify customers, along with their monthly bills, of their right to join a lawsuit against the company. The court, without comment, let stand a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> ruling that the company's free-speech rights are not violated by requiring it to include such notices with its bills. The case stems from a suit accusing <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, of antitrust violations. Five individuals and a corporation sued on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s 1.2 million residential and 235,000 business customers in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 ordered <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> to offer customers a choice of whether they wanted to continue paying the company to maintain telephone wiring within their home or business. The telephone company notified customers it would assume they wished to continue the service unless told otherwise. The suit against <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> said that tactic violated antitrust law by misleading customers. The suit seeks to force the company to refund fees paid for wiring maintenance. The average claim per customer would be between $ 35 and $ 50. A state judge said that because the suit is in behalf of all <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> customers _ a class-action claim _ all customers must be given a chance to take part or exclude themselves. That decision entails risk. If <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> wins the case, any customer who chose to participate would be required to share in paying the legal costs. The state judge ordered customers be notified of their options along with monthly bills from the company. Those who sued <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> said it would cost them $ 500,000 if the notices were mailed separately but only $ 300,000 if the notices were included in the bills. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in July upheld the order that the notices be sent with the monthly bills. `` There is no danger ... that a customer would somehow construe the notice as an endorsement by Mountain Bell of the class action or a concession on its part that the pending lawsuit has merit,'' the state court said. `` The notice merely provides class members with objectively neutral information.'' The state court rejected arguments that the notice procedure conflicts with a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. The justices in that case allowed a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> utility company to exclude from its billing envelopes messages by a consumer protection group. The <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> court said <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s case is different because the notice of the lawsuit `` is devoid of economic, ideological or political advocacy. What we are dealing with here is a legal notice.'' Mountain Bell's appeal was supported by numerous banking, credit card, gasoline and utility companies. The case is Mountain States Telephone vs. District Court of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, 89-531.

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> today criticized its 2.3 million-member youth organization for breaking away and said the leadership in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> was paying `` a bitter price'' for resisting reform. The official party newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> said the decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Freie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jugend </ORGANIZATION>, or Free German Youth, to abandon the party could threaten the youth group's future. The group, the traditional stepping stone to success for the Communist leadership, including party chief <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, announced Friday it no longer wanted to be the `` helper and fighting reserve'' of the party. In a commentary, Neues Deutschland spoke of a `` loss of confidence'' in the youth group, which it said is `` struggling for a new profile and perhaps for its existence.'' Another Communist-run daily, the <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitung </PERSON>, offered <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s harshest criticism to date of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s rulers, saying they were paying `` the bitter price for the grave errors of the past.'' The commentary traced the troubles of the party leadership in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> to refusing political reforms and to `` the illusory, risky business of trying to choke the call for democracy with police clubs 10 days ago.'' It was referring to the police crackdown on demonstrators in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> on Nov. 17. The severity of the crackdown sparked an unprecedented series of protest that has forced the ouster of hard-line Communists, including party chief <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>. The National Democrats, one of the smaller parties long allied with the Communists, appealed today for a `` more effective and more humane socialism'' in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The comments by party leader <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumke </PERSON> echoed Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s remarks Sunday in Pravda. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s statement was seen as an endorsement of the 1968 `` Prague Spring'' slogan of `` socialism with a human face,'' adopted anew by pro-democracy protesters in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> In another sign of the East German party's own problems, Communist sources said Sunday that huge amounts of money earned from Communist Party-owned businesses in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are unaccounted for. Party reformers have urged an inquiry to determine if the revenues were diverted, the sources said. The charges of revenue diversion concern money earned at businesses, including trading firms and hard-currency shops, set up to earn West German marks and other foreign currency, the party sources said Sunday on condition of anonymity. Earnings of the roughly 100 companies total from $ 3.8 billion to $ 6.5 billion per year, much of which is unaccounted for, the sources said. `` These companies have misappropriated money that belongs to the people,'' one source said. The party sources said several high-ranking reform-minded Communists, whose names were not disclosed, have called for an investigation to determine where the money went. The enterprises included electronics and transport companies and an art trading company, among many others, the party sources said. They said the enterprises include the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> company <ORGANIZATION> Intrac </ORGANIZATION>, specializing in trade in chemicals and metals, and a company identified only as one `` for internal and foreign trade in radioactive and stable isotopes.'' Such an investigation would be only the latest show of discontent with the party. The party has lost about 200,000 people _ or 10 percent of its membership _ in the past two months, <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> quoted <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirtschin </PERSON> as saying in its weekend edition. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, facing a battle for his political career at a party congress next month, has been trying to shift attention to abuses that can be blamed on his predecessor, <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, however, was a member of <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s inner circle and former chief of the country's security apparatus. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was ousted Oct. 18 and replaced by <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, who has presided over the opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and an official commitment to reform. Among <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s moves toward power-sharing have been to propose `` round-table'' talks with the opposition, similar to the discussions that led to dramatic political changes in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s party today failed to win a majority in elections for only the second time in 42 years as voters deserted it for a new centrist alliance and a fundamentalist Hindu party. Incomplete results from the election for a new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> showed the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with more seats than any single opposition group but far short of a mandate to form the next government alone. That leaves <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> in the difficult position of trying to form a coalition government _ the first in the history of the world's most populous democracy. The fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Bharatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, capitalizing on a rise in Hindu nationalism, appeared destined to be the pivotal player. Its leader said today he would `` see to it that they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- fall from power.'' President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> dissolved <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> tonight, the first formal step toward seating a new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> is now a caretaker prime minister until his party or the opposition manage to form a new government. The election was a major blow to <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, who had been tainted by allegations of government corruption and ineptitude. His family dynasty has governed <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for all but five years since it won independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s leadership also had been called into question by the widespread vote fraud and violence in the election that claimed 137 lives, making it the bloodiest balloting in modern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s history. The election for seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making lower house started Wednesday and was scheduled to end Sunday, but re-voting was ordered in some districts because of alleged fraud. Balloting ended today, and by sundown winners were declared in 373 of the 525 races. State television, compiling results from the <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had 160 seats. Its party allies had 17. A majority in the new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> _ and with it the mandate to form a new government _ requires 263 seats. The centrist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a five-party alliance led by former defense and finance minister <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, had 81 seats. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, an ex-Congress Party member, was once <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s ally but is now the prime minister's most outspoken political foe. The <ORGANIZATION> Bharatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION>, which won just two seats in the last elections in 1984, had 69. The rest of the seats went to smaller parties and independents. Many undeclared seats are in states where the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> was expected to do well. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s poor showing could hurt it in the search for coalition partners or trigger a revolt against the prime minister by colleagues in his own party. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants to win anything, the prime minister must go,'' said independent analyst <PERSON> Bhabani </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>. `` With <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, very few things are possible. Without <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, many things are possible.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> dismissed the possibility of a coalition with the <ORGANIZATION> Bharatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` We will contemptuously reject any overtures from the <ORGANIZATION> BJP </ORGANIZATION>. There's no question -LRB- of aligning with them -RRB-,'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Anand </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON> said. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is not in a tearing hurry'' to seek a coalition with anyone. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has never had a coalition government, and the prospect plunged many into confusion. To create a coalition, the president would ask the party with the most seats to try to muster enough partners for a parliamentary majority. If that fails, the president could ask another party to try to forge a majority in alliance with other parties. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, 45, the grandson of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s first prime minister, <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>, was plunged into the leadership when his mother, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, was assassinated in 1984. His party then took an unprecedented 415 of the seats in the lower house. The initial euphoria over a young, seemingly dynamic leader was soon tarnished by allegations of government corruption and ineptitude. The trouble came home to roost in <LOCATION> Gandhi </LOCATION>'s own election district of <LOCATION> Amethi </LOCATION>, where the outcome of his race for re-election is still in limbo. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was expected to win easily when the remote area of dusty villages voted on Wednesday. But the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> complained of widespread fraud by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> activists, and another vote was held today in about 18 percent of the district. Polling officer <PERSON> Uday </PERSON> <PERSON> Raj </PERSON> <PERSON> Pandey </PERSON> estimated more than 50 percent of the voters showed up in <LOCATION> Amethi </LOCATION>. There were few issues in the campaign, apart from being for or against <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Another factor in the election was a revival of Hindu fundamentalism. The surge followed Hindu-Moslem riots earlier this month that left more than 300 people dead. The riots were sparked by a campaign to build a temple on the site of a 16th century Moslem mosque. Moslems voters also may have abandoned the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, their traditional election choice, because the government did not prevent the riots. Most of those who died were Moslems. Parliament's lower house has 543 seats, but only 524 were at stake in the elections. No election was held for a seat with an unopposed candidate. The elections for the rest of the seats were postponed indefinitely because of incomplete voter lists or candidates' deaths

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to let public schools cut off educational help to severely handicapped children even though they may not be able to benefit from such services. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> school district ordered to help a profoundly retarded 13-year-old boy. The case has attracted widespread attention from educators and state and local government officials nationwide who supported the appeal by the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, school district. In other action today, the court: _ Dealt a blow to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s campaign to halt the spread of homelessness by refusing to revive a local law successfully challenged by developers. The justices, without comment, left intact a ruling that a law banning conversion or demolition of single-room-occupancy housing unconstitutionally confiscates private property. _ Turned down an appeal by <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> law enforcement officials sued for strip-searching a woman charged with operating her car without proper registration or insurance. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that strip-searching people accused of minor traffic violations generally violates their rights. _ Left intact an <LOCATION> Overland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, ordinance restricting the ownership and possession of `` pit bull dogs.'' The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the city ordinance is unconstitutionally too vague. The boy in the handicapped-education case, identified as <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON>, has been severely handicapped since he was born two months prematurely Dec. 8, 1975. <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> school officials said he is incapable of learning even rudimentary skills. `` <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> has consistently exhibited profound mental and developmental retardation, deafness and blindness, a persistent convulsive disorder and severe cerebral palsy,'' they said. `` He is virtually immobile, suffers from spasticity and has contracted joints.'' But the boy's mother and some therapists painted a somewhat different picture. They said he sees bright light, smiles when happy, cries when sad, listens to television and music, and responds to touching and talking. At issue is the duty of states and local school officials under the federal Education for All Handicapped Children Act, which provides federal aid and in turn requires programs to help such children. The 1st U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in May that under the law `` it is the state's responsibility to experiment, refine and improve upon the educational services it provides to handicapped children and not ... to exclude handicapped children if there is no proof that they can benefit from the existing program that a state might offer at a particular time.'' A chief aim of the law is to help the most severely handicapped, the appeals court said as it reinstated a lawsuit by <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON>'s mother seeking educational services and $ 175,000 in damages <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> school officials said the appeals court ruling means states and cities will be forced to divert scarce resources from those who can benefit to children who can not be helped. They said the federal government contributes less than $ 300 to the $ 15,000 a year it will take to provide educational services to <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON>. Among those supporting the school officials' appeal in the handicapped case were the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislatures </ORGANIZATION>. The school boards and school administrators, in a friend-of-the-court brief, said the appeals court ruling could have devastating consequences. They quoted therapist <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who at one time testified for <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> but said she since has changed her mind. To spend money and require teachers to help someone incapable of learning `` is not only a misuse of money, it raises false hopes in the children's families,'' she said. `` It results in a burnout in teachers, therapists and social workers.'' The case is <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, vs. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON>, 89-515.

 Legislators today gave final approval to a plan putting the small Baltic republics on the road to economic autonomy from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next year and possibly issuing their own currencies. Deputies from the tiny republic of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> stood and cheered after the Soviet Parliament approved the measure on a vote of 296-67. Another 37 deputies abstained. A final vote on the bill had been delayed from Friday after a sharp debate on whether the move amounted to an effort to tear apart the Soviet system. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> presided over the sessions Friday and today and supported the bill as a step toward economic reform. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the law goes into effect Jan. 1 and gives <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> `` the right to engage in independent economic activity and envisages equal participation in union activity.'' Baltic deputies stressed that the law gives them more control over factories now controlled by government ministries based in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

 Cholesterol screenings in shopping malls and other public settings can be dangerous because of an alarming potential for inaccurate results and risk of infection, a federal official said today. `` Given today's concern for the spread of AIDS and hepatitis, these findings are particularly disturbing,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON>, inspector general of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said in testimony presented to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> said he was concerned that public screenings are `` growing by leaps and bounds. Private companies are jumping in, manufacturers are promoting their products by saying anyone can use them.'' And, he said, many screenings are conducted in `` a carnival-like atmosphere.'' <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> recommended federal regulation of all cholesterol screenings that are not conducted by health care professionals. Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on regulation and business opportunities, said he is concerned that with inaccurate screening results, people `` can be lulled into a false sense of security _ they may not see a doctor, they may not change their diets and they may not exercise. `` Over time, not knowing they are in the danger zone could cost them their health and even their lives,'' <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said. An investigation by the inspector general, requested by <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>'s panel, found that basic rules of hygiene were often ignored, qualifications and training of testers varied widely and public screenings often lacked the optimal conditions needed to produce accurate results with portable analyzers `` The public in general is not aware of these shortcomings, and does not know what to look for in safe, high-quality public screening programs,'' said the report. `` In addition, screening staff may be placing themselves as well as screenees at risk due to marginal observation of the basic rules of hygiene and infection control procedures,'' the report said. Cholesterol screenings are conducted at shopping malls, pharmacies, health clubs, village halls and a variety of other public settings. The report said it found no reliable national statistics on prevalence of screenings but said that because of greater awareness of the link between high cholesterol and heart disease, `` demand for screening is increasing significantly.'' `` At a time when over 60 million adult Americans may currently have high blood cholesterol, placing them at risk of heart disease, it defies common sense to allow unregulated public screening to continue,'' <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said. His subcommittee has been studying medical testing, and its finding that a quarter of all such testing was being done in unregulated settings led to a 1988 law that brings all clinical laboratories under federal regulation. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is drafting regulations to implement the law. The law provides that some medical testing may be exempt from its provisions, but the inspector general recommended public screenings be included in the regulations because `` federal regulation ... is clearly called for in order to safeguard the public.'' Sixteen states regulate public cholesterol screening, but regulations in four of them have not yet been implemented, the report said. The report was based on a review of state and federal laws and regulations, research studies and reports as well as interviews with 250 experts and public officials. It also included a special field survey in which investigators participated in 71 public cholesterol screenings that were randomly selected in 10 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The investigators' test results were not analyzed for accuracy, but participants observed the conditions under which the tests were conducted and rated them against the guidelines issued by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cholesterol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium of organizations coordinated by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION>, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Investigators said that contrary to the guidelines, the atmosphere at many screenings was frenzied, with little or no privacy for those being tested, and that many times testers had no professional experience and minimal training. Nearly 60 percent of the investigators whose blood was drawn with a finger prick had their fingers squeezed or `` milked,'' which can dilute the sample with material from between the cells and give a lower than true result. Also, the investigators reported that a third of the testers wore no gloves. Some who wore no gloves handled money and collected blood samples. Though investigators did not see any lancets being reused, one reported that `` at a pharmacy, staff were observed inspecting lancets lying on the table because they were afraid they had put a used one back in with the new ones.'' Contrary to the NCEP guidelines, less than 20 percent of the investigators who were screened were told that screening is only a guide to potential problems and not a diagnostic test. The investigators also reported that while hospitals conducting screenings frequently provided physician referrals, for-profit screeners `` rarely even mentioned referral.''

<HEAD>Investigator Finds Thousands of People Buried in Used Graves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An archaeologist says as many as 48,000 people might be buried in previously occupied graves at two cemeteries. `` It may be beyond the abilities of most people to comprehend just what has gone on out here,'' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBlasi </PERSON>, an archaeologist who has excavated about 100 graves at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> cemeteries during an investigation for the state attorney general's office. Some graves were found to contain the remains of as many as six people, and graves containing the remains of three or four are `` a common occurrence,'' <PERSON> DiBlasi </PERSON> said. Remains from previous burials were found so often in a section of Eastern Cemetery that about 70 infants' bodies were buried only 10 to 18 inches deep in an effort to avoid bones, employees have told investigators. The investigation has led to the indictment of three employees who ran the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crematory </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cemeteries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc.. A <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury returned a 60-count indictment against the company in Also indicted were <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the executive director since May 1986; <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, the board president who had been acting executive director from 1980 to 1986; and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Copley </PERSON>, vice president of the board, who began working for the company in October 1987. All three men have resigned and all have pleaded innocent to the charges. They are to be tried in February on charges that include the reuse of graves and abuse of corpses. If convicted, they could receive prison terms ranging from 188 to 268 years, plus fines of up to $ 4,000. <PERSON> DiBlasi </PERSON> said his excavations during the last four months indicated that graves were being reused as early as the mid-1920s in Eastern Cemetery. Cemetery records indicate it was probably full shortly after the turn of the century. Comprising 15 acres, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had enough room for about 18,000 bodies under existing cemetery-industry standards. But an estimated 51,000 bodies have been buried there, meaning 33,000 were improperly buried, according to <PERSON> DiBlasi </PERSON> and a report by another investigator filed in the court case. The report of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, an investigator for the attorney general's office, also estimated that about 15,000 too many bodies were buried at <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>. The 141-year-old cemetery company came under scrutiny in May, when <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a grave-digger and maintenance worker for eight years, called the attorney general's office to report the alleged burial practices, <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>'s report said. During the subsequent investigation, <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> found human bones stored throughout <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> _ in a truck's glove compartment, in a tool box, in a storage shed, in dirt piles and even in a fast food hamburger bag, his report said.

<HEAD>Judge To Decide Who First Saw Knapsack With $10,900</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A simple case of a knapsack stuffed with $ 10,900 that was found in a private yard has turned into a four-way court battle that is full of contradictions and suspicions. The knapsack turned up on May 1, 1986, behind the home of <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lona </PERSON> <PERSON> Stussy </PERSON>, the first party claiming the money. Stussy says he saw the knapsack between 6 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. that day when he left for work. He said he was in a rush, so he did n't look inside it but called from his office and asked his wife to check it out. Mrs. <PERSON> Stussy </PERSON> apparently did n't rush to look at the strange pack lying in her back yard. But a live-in babysitter, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, says she spotted it when taking out the garbage. Then she and Mrs. <PERSON> Stussy </PERSON> took a closer look. Mrs. <PERSON> Stussy </PERSON> says she immediately saw loose bills, but did n't see all of the cash and did n't mention it at the time. <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> says she did n't notice any money in the bag until after police picked it up later that morning. She is not making any claim on the money. Claimant No. 2 is the Stussys' former live-in handyman, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who says he found the knapsack after midnight, long before the Stussys got up. However, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> saw no money, only what looked like burglary tools, and says he was stunned when lawyers told him more than a year later that cash was found in the pack. In any event, <PERSON> Stussy </PERSON> eventually called police and when officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pielow </PERSON> arrived he looked in the bag and found $ 10,900 in a brown gunnysack. In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, the law allows finders to become keepers if six months pass without anyone claiming lost property. After the deadline passed, the Stussys filed a claim. Enter claimant No. 3. The <ORGANIZATION> Minneapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the police pension fund, decided it wanted the money. Under law, if an officer finds money that does n't get claimed, the money goes into the pension fund. The association insists officer <PERSON> Pielow </PERSON> is the legal finder of the money because he was the first to look inside. Then the fourth contestant, <PERSON> Nowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, stepped forward. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, a cabinetmaker and real estate agent in suburban <LOCATION> Wayzata </LOCATION>, insists the money and the knapsack were stolen from his car April 30, 1986, when he parked it near the Stussys' home to walk a girlfriend around Lake of the Isles. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> has some solid evidence to back up his claim _ a police report he made on the night of the theft. The report describes the pack right down to the brand name. But even <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s claim contains a discrepancy, because the police report says he originally claimed a theft of $ 4,000 in cash, which he says was for a down payment on real estate. He now claims that much more cash was stolen. So far, the legal battle has produced a 2-inch-thick pad of legal documents. Yet nowhere in that paperwork is there an explanation for how the knapsack ended up in the Sussys' backyard. `` I do n't think we'll ever know unless the person who was dumb enough to put $ 10,900 in bills in the knapsack comes forward,'' said lawyer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Karney </PERSON>, who represents the Stussys.

<HEAD>Repatriation of Vietnamese to Begin in February or March</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The forced repatriation of Vietnamese boat people from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> camps will begin by February or March, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maude </PERSON> would not confirm or deny a report in the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> that the repatriation will begin by Christmas and that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has agreed to pay <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> $ 620 for each person on the first airlift. The Financial Times, quoting Vietnamese officials in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, said the first repatriations probably would be on a 120-seat <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 chartered by the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government. It said <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> also was considering chartering larger aircraft or troop carriers, and passenger liners capable of carrying up to 1,000 passengers. The repatriation `` has to start before the sailing season starts again in February or March,'' <PERSON> Maude </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> radio. `` Last year no fewer than 32,000 people arrived in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. We can not possibly tolerate that happening again.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> says most of the 56,000 people sheltered in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> have not fled political or religious persecution, but simply are seeking a better standard of living than that available at home. Each is being screened in accordance with standards set down by the Office of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for refugees. Only 13,000 have been declared genuine refugees. Referring to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> objections to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s plans for forcible repatriation, <PERSON> Maude </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` has agreed that there is nowhere for these people to go other than back to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' Asked whether <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would be relieved if another country offered to take 5,000 or 10,000 of the boat people, he replied: `` There would still be 30,000 to 35,000 left. There are no takers for these people. ... There has been unanimous agreement in the international community that there is no place for these people to go other than back to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> has said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would likely pay compensation to the boat people it sends back so they can buy tools and seeds. It has said the sum would be similar to the $ 600 paid to boat people who go home voluntarily. So far, fewer than 400 people have returned voluntarily to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.

 The ruling party said today the opposition had won the first free vote in four decades, on a referendum postponing presidential elections to give the fledgling movement more time to organize and become better known. Final results were not expected until Tuesday, but the presidential candidate of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, formerly the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, conceded that voters Sunday approved the referendum backed by opposition parties. `` We can be certain that the number of ` yes' votes was higher than the ` no' votes,'' said <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, the popular Socialist candidate. The results would mean that a new democratic <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, to be chosen by June, will elect the president of the new Hungarian republic. If voters had rejected the referendum, they would have elected a president directly on Jan. 7. Opposition groups favored postponing the vote until after parliamentary elections, saying that otherwise they could not sufficiently organize a serious challenge to <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>. They hope to win strong representation in the new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, giving their candidate a better chance at the presidency. They also proposed that the president's powers be curtailed. With 91.3 percent of the ballots tallied, 50.2 percent favored a direct election before the parliamentary elections and 49.8 percent were for postponement until afterward, said Pal <PERSON> Kara </PERSON>, secretary of the referendum committee in parliament told journalists. <PERSON> Kara </PERSON> said the voted yet to be counted could swing the vote the other way. Final results were not to be made public before Tuesday, he said. The turnout represents 58.2 percent of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s 7.8 million eligible voters, <PERSON> Kara </PERSON> said _ above the 50 percent needed to make to vote binding. The plebiscite is the first free vote in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> since Communists came to power more than four decades ago. It comes just a month after a new republic was declared in a symbolic rejection of Communist rule and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> adopted legislation opening the way for the free multiparty elections. The turnout marked `` an important step'' in the country's drive for democracy, said <PERSON> Tibor </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidos </PERSON>, the executive director of the opposition Free Democrats. `` It shows people are interested in deciding their own future.'' The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ which replaced the recently dissolved <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ and several other opposition groups had agreed on direct voting for the first president of the republic before the parliamentary elections. However, the League of Free Democrats and three other groups expressed concern that if <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> won in early presidential elections, too much power could be concentrated with the ruling Socialists before a democratic <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> can been chosen. They gathered more than 100,000 signatures on a petition calling for the referendum. The powers of the new presidency include commanding the armed forces, calling elections and dissolving <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Three other questions on the ballot dealt with traditional aspects of the governing party's power. _ Whether the <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Militia </ORGANIZATION>, created to protect the party, should be dissolved; _ Whether the party should remove its organizational cells from the workplace; _ And whether it should make a public accounting of its assets. With the militia in the process of being dissolved, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> voting against continued politization of the businesses and factories and agreement to open <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> books, voting on the latter three issues was purely symbolic.

<TEXT>
 Three of four state social workers charged with failure to report suspected abuse before the potty-training death of a toddler would pay only a $ 100 fine under a deal offered today by prosecutors, attorneys said. The offer by prosecutors would avoid jail sentences for the three, who were each charged with misdemeanors Aug. 31 in the case of 2-year-old <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>. The boy died of a brain hemorrhage after his mother and stepfather punished him for soiling his diapers by dunking him head-first into a commode, police said. An investigation revealed that the child was released to his parents' custody despite warnings by a foster parent of the possibility of abuse. The plea agreement was offered to <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Houk </PERSON>, a state program administrator, supervisor <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and caseworker <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> DuBoise </PERSON>; each was charged with failing to report child abuse, a misdemeanor. <PERSON> Caseworker </PERSON> <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> was charged with aggravated child abuse, a felony charge, in addition to the misdemeanor charge. She was not offered any deal, attorney said. A conviction on the felony could mean a jail sentence of up to five years; conviction on the misdemeanor could be punished by up to 60 days in jail. Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguero </PERSON> acknowledged that a plea agreement was in the works, but would not comment on the details. A pre-trial hearing on the case was set for Dec. 28. The mother and stepfather of <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> have been charged with first-degree murder in the July 28 death of the child. Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> passed a bill allocating $ 39 million to pay for more caseworkers to prevent child abuse.

 Opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON>, a U.S.-trained economist, claimed victory today in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' third free election this decade. Official returns were incomplete. `` I invite my opponents to join me in reconstructing <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told a cheering crowd at election headquarters early this morning. In unofficial returns representing about 67 percent of precincts, <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> had 595,807 votes, or about 50.2 percent, to 526,110, or about 44.5 percent, for <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Official returns, much slower in coming out, showed a narrower lead. After announcing <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> had 44,538 votes to <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>' 43,383 late Sunday, the electoral tribunal announced that its computer had crashed and it closed for the night. `` We may have to start over,'' said <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrientos </PERSON>, a member of the tribunal's information committee, in an interview at the computer center today. He said the problem may have been related to the large volume of incoming results, but tests were being run. Minor parties took the rest of the vote; only a plurality was needed to win. `` If the present trend continues, <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> will win,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> treasurer <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Maradiaga </PERSON> in a telephone interview. `` The people will regret this.'' If <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> takes office on Jan. 27 for a four-year term, he will become the first opposition candidate to take power in a peaceful vote in 57 years. The winner faces grim problems in this underdeveloped nation of about 5 million _ a stagnant economy, an unpayable debt and wars in two bordering countries, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. On Sunday, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> suspended relations with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and accused it of arming leftist Salvadoran guerrillas. `` In this violent <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where the youth of our neighbors is spilling its blood, the people of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> have given a ` yes' to peace and a ` no' to blood,'' <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> said in an earlier victory statement at party headquarters Sunday night. <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, has made it clear that he wants U.S.-supported Contras fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government to leave <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, but he also fears <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> will alone have to deal with getting rid of the Contra fighters if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid stops. He offered no new ideas for achieving that end during the campaign. On Sunday he called for Central American presidents to `` reconstruct'' the peace process in the wake of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s decision to break with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> He also said he would be willing to accompany <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> to any summit that might take place before Jan. 27. <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> has promised to privatize government-owned companies, cut government spending and open the nation to foreign investment. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> has suspended loans on Dec. 1 because <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has refused to negotiate over payments on old debt. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> owes $ 3.2 billion, most of it to international institutions, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is holding up $ 70 million in fiscal aid until <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> makes an arrangement with those institutions. <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON>, 46, comes from a landowning family and was trained as an agricultural economist at <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He attributed the election's results to `` hard work and the desire for change'' and pitched his campaign against the government of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON>, saying eight years of <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> government had only made things worse. Also at stake were three vice presidential posts, a 130-seat unicameral congress and 289 mayoralties. Voting was by party slate, with no ticket splitting allowed. The Nationalists appeared to be gaining a congressional majority, and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Melgar </PERSON> claimed victory in the capital of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. More than 2.2 million people were registered, but voting was concentrated at relatively few locations and some people had to travel long distances. Turnout was nevertheless heavy and observers reported few irregularties. `` The problems do n't appear to systematically favor one side or another,'' said an observer for the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The last time there was a party-to-party transition came in 1933, when <PERSON> Tiburcio </PERSON> <PERSON> Carias </PERSON> <PERSON> Andino </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> took over from <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vicente </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mejia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colindres </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carias </PERSON> did n't allow another vote until 1948.

<HEAD>Existing Home Sales Remain at Highest Pace in Nine Months</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Existing-home sales last month remained steady at their highest level since January, a real estate trade group said Monday, and analysts expect single-digit mortgage rates to sustain sales well into the new year. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said sales of existing single-family homes totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.52 million, the same as September's revised rate and the highest since January's 3.55 million rate. The September rate was 1.2 percent above August's 3.48 million sales. The Realtors' survey, falling mortgage interest rates and an earlier government report of a 12 percent increase in new housing starts in October make `` things look somewhat brighter for the housing market in the future,'' said economist <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> and the Realtors' chief economist, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, predicted that mortgage rates will remain low into next year, with <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> suggesting they could fall as low as 9 percent by early next spring. `` Overall, home financing conditions probably will stay quite favorable in the months ahead,'' <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> also said he expects October's new home sales to post a sharp rebound from September's 14 percent drop, which analysts said resulted from a spike in mortgage rates to above 10 percent. Fixed-rate mortgages fell steadily from 10.10 percent to 9.82 percent during October, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and had dropped to 9.74 percent by last Wednesday. `` Lower rates are sustaining sales at a healthy clip,'' said Realtors' President <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>. `` Buyers priced out by higher rates earlier this year are in the market now.'' For a year, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> pushed interest rates higher to battle inflationary pressures. But, since last spring, the central bank has been gradually easing its grip on credit, allowing mortgage rates and a variety of other consumer and business loan rates to fall. The Realtors said the national median price for an existing single-family home was $ 92,100, down $ 2,200 from September. The median price means that half the homes sold for more, half for less. The West posted the only increase in sales in October, up 3.4 percent to an annual rate of 610,000 units, the Realtors said. The median price for a home in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> was $ 142,200, $ 5,400 below the September cost. Sales were unchanged from September's 1.34 million unit rate in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where the median home price was $ 83,400, down $ 1,000 from September. Sales declined 1 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to 980,000 and dropped 1.7 percent to 580,000 units in the Northeast. The median price for a home in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> was $ 70,900, $ 1,300 below the September price, and $ 143,300 in the Northeast, $ 2,400 below the September cost.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> is `` a broken man'' since his ouster as East German leader last month, his bodyguard said Monday. `` For him the world has fallen apart,'' said Gen. <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, speaking to reporters at the secluded <LOCATION> Wandlitz </LOCATION> residential area oustide <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, 77, was ousted Oct. 18 amid a massive exodus of East Germans heading West and large anti-government demonstrations. He was replaced by <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, speaking to reporters outside <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s house in the wooded compound, said the former leader was ailing. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> also has said that <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> is too ill to be questioned by a party commission conducting a disciplinary investigation of <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. He underwent two gall bladder operations during the summer, and his wife has said he still has not recovered fully. Reporters caught a glimpse of <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> on the upper floor of the house, apparently talking to a visitor and looking through some papers. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Margot </PERSON>, who lost her post as education minister shortly her husband's ouster, want to move from <PERSON> Wandlitz </PERSON> before the end of the year. `` But it's not easy to find a suitable apartment for old men and their families in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. `` Otherwise, this place would be empty already.'' The Communist Party elite for years has lived in the walled, heavily guarded compound. But <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> moved to a modest house in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> one week ago and said other leading party officials would follow. Authorities allowed East German journalists to tour <PERSON> Wandlitz </PERSON> for the first time last week, and on Monday allowed a tour of the compound by Western reporters. Other ousted Politburo members still live in <LOCATION> Wandlitz </LOCATION>, including former economy chief <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> and former propaganda chief <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s new leadership has blamed <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> for plunging the country into the crisis and <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> has been kicked out of the party. The investigation of <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> could result in his ouster from the party. A special parliamentary commission also is investigating charges of abuse of power by the former leadership.

 Rebel troops attacked the presidential palace in the <LOCATION> Comoro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and killed the longtime ruler of the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island nation, state-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comoro </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Comoro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said Sunday night's attack was led by a former army commander who recently resigned in a dispute with President <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> The ex-commandant, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON>, led an undetermined number of men in the assassination, said an embassy official who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> had been arrested and was in custody. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Djohar </PERSON>, will head an interim government as dictated by the constitution, the official said. He stressed that it was an assassination, not a coup. Life in the capital appeared calm today. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, manager of the Galewa Sun hotel, told the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> everything was normal. Radio Comoro, monitored on the French-administered island of <PERSON> Mayotte </PERSON>, reported that <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON>, 70, was killed in a firefight between the rebels and members of his 300-man presidential guard. One guard was reported killed. The presidential guard is better equipped and trained than the 700-man regular forces formerly commanded by <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON>. It was not immediately known whether any guard members were involved in the assassination plot. The rebel forces launched their attack in the capital of <LOCATION> Moroni </LOCATION>, on the main island of Grand Camore, at about midnight Sunday, the French news agency Agence France-Presse reported. Forty days of mourning were declared. <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> will be buried Tuesday on his native island of <LOCATION> Anjouan </LOCATION>, the radio station said. Three weeks ago, <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON>, who ruled the island for all but three years since 1972, won a referendum that permitted him to seek a third six-year term when his current term expired next year. Official results showed it passed with 92.5 percent of the vote but observers complained of ballot-box stuffing, voter harassment and destroyed ballots. Opposition figures in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> had jailed political leaders who complained he had concentrated too much power in his own hands. <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> was first elected president of the Comoran government in 1972, when the archipelago was still a French possession. The Comoros unilaterally declared independence in July 1975 and <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> became head of state. He was overthrown a month later by <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Soilih </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> had amassed personal power in a dictatorial style. <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> returned to power in 1978 with the aid of 50 mercenaries led by Frenchman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Denard </PERSON>. He established an Islamic republic and ran unopposed for re-election in 1984. <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> survived coup attempts in 1983, 1985 and 1987. His government denied reports of a coup attempt in 1981. South African President F.W. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> sent a message of condolence addressed only to the `` acting head of government'' condemning the `` senseless assassination.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s trade representative in the <ORGANIZATION> Comoros </ORGANIZATION> reported `` the situation was under the control of the security forces and that everything was calm. The Comoros lie between <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and the island nation of <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>. The three islands of <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comore </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Anjouan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moheli </LOCATION> cover 718 square miles. The island of <PERSON> Mayotte </PERSON>, claimed by the Comoran government, decided in a 1975 referendum to remain French. About a half-million people, mostly Moslem, live in the republic. It is known for tourism and the export of perfume, copra, coconuts, cloves, vanilla and cinammon. The country, with an estimated annual per capita income of $ 339, is among the world's poorest and least developed.

 The White House today applauded the democratic steps taken by <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and urged the communist country to follow the path <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> are taking toward political and economic renewal. The statement came as millions of Czechs took part in a two-hour strike to press their demands for political freedoms.

Communist premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> held unprecedented talks Sunday with opposition leaders. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in a statement: `` Over the weekend the public demand for basic freedoms has spread to another country in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The Czechoslovak people have spoken loudly and clearly.

 It took two passes in a hydraulic lift, but first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> finally got close enough to the top of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christmas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> to crown it with a white plastic star Monday. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was joined on the somewhat bumpy journey in the hydraulic lift to the top of the 35-foot tree by her 3 -LCB- - year-old granddaughter, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, president of the Christmas Pageant of Peace The lift operator left the threesome a few feet short on his first try. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has been topping off the National Christmas Tree every November since 1981, signalled to him to lift them higher, and on the second try she and <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> managed to get a silver pole holding the outsized plastic star in place. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, seasonally garbed in a bright red dress with a red ribbon in her hair, took it all in stride, waving to her mother, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and preschool classmates on the ground below. When the ride downward was briefly halted, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> called out cheerfully, but insistently, `` Hey, when are we going down? Get me down here.'' `` Perfect,'' pronounced Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the white cage finally perched on terra firma. She took <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> over to shake hands and pose for a picture with the lift operator, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> tree worker <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Guard </PERSON>. `` I thought she was coming over to chew me out,'' Guard said afterward. `` She just said thanks.'' Guard, 35, was pressed into service when the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> found itself with a rented lift, but no operator. `` I was scared to death,'' he said. `` I'm in trees _ trim them, cut them down, make them safe.'' Asked how he wound up with the job of hoisting the first lady and kin up to the top of the living Christmas tree, Guard said: `` It just happened. I usually drive a cherry picker. They did n't have an operator, so I did it. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said that topping off the tree was one of her favorite duties as the vice president's wife, and when <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> asked her last year if she wanted to keep doing it, she leapt at the opportunity, becoming the first first lady to do so.

<HEAD>City Official's Spending Endorses Topless Bar</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A convention recruiter who had hoped public fervor was quelled when he promised city officials he would no longer take clients to a posh topless nightclub has learned that signs of the controversy still exist. <PERSON> Jordy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tollett </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, has found his explanation has become a giant endorsement for the nightclub. Printed in large yellow letters at the bottom of a 40-foot-by-20-foot billboard for <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>'s restaurant and bar are <PERSON> Tollett </PERSON>'s words: `` Our clients want to go there!'' In September, The <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Tollett </PERSON> had spent more than $ 2,000 entertaining male clients at the club with funds from the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> _ 75 percent of which come from taxes. The Civic Center department, with a $ 26 million budget, oversees the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, among other facilities. In his defense, the mayoral appointee said he was wooing convention business. `` Unfortunately, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>'s just happens to be something that's very well-known,'' <PERSON> Tollett </PERSON> said at the time. `` They -LRB- clients -RRB- just wanted to go there. I could n't say, ` You ca n't go there.''' <PERSON> Tollett </PERSON> was admonished privately by Mayor <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> and subsequently promised never to take clients there again. Since then, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>'s owners have spent $ 6,000 a month for three billboards. The billboard also features endorsements from <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> of `` Lifestyles of the <ORGANIZATION> Rich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Famous'' and `` Penthouse Magazine.'' But the appearance of <PERSON> Tollett </PERSON>'s words has embarrassed him and angered <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, the new president of the convention bureau. `` I have limited sympathy for their discomfort because I'm very proud of my business and the city of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s better off for it,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Watters </PERSON>, an owner of <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>'s. But there were sore feelings over the matter at <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>'s, which boasts an expensive and sophisticated atmosphere. `` It's the same old hypocrisy thing,'' said <PERSON> Watters </PERSON>, who said the convention bureau solicits its membership each year and privately acknowledges that conventioneers flock to the cabaret. But, he said, publicly, bureau officials complain about the club. He said at first, the endorsement was attributed to the bureau itself. But after <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> called several times to complain, <PERSON> Watters </PERSON> said the sign was changed to reflect <PERSON> Tollett </PERSON> as author of the statement.

 King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> told the new parliament Monday he will legalize political parties and relax martial law, opening the way to more freedom in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> after the first national elections in 22 years. `` There is no doubt the current national assembly represents a new phase in our life,'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said in a speech inaugurating the legislature. He spoke of commitment to freedom of thought and expression in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, where political parties have been banned for 33 years, and martial law has been in force for 22, since the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> war of 1967. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, dressed in a black ceremonial military uniform, said he would have a royal commission draft a national charter defining `` the basic central concepts of nationalism and patriotism.'' `` The emergence and activity of political organizations will be based on these concepts and definitions,'' he told a joint session of the 80-member Chamber of Deputies, elected by the people, and the 40 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, appointed by the king. Parties were banned in 1957 after a coup attempt by leftists, but the government permitted them to run candidates in the elections last month. The king said the government would try to strengthen civilian courts `` to reduce gradually the need for martial and special courts.'' Loss of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1967 made blocked national elections until <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> renounced sovereignty over the territory last year, in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Martial law gives the government sweeping powers, forbids unlicensed gatherings and restricts legal rights. It has been applied to a range of matters from murder cases through bank scandals to allegations of price-gouging by vegetable vendors. In their campaigns, most legislative candidates demanded legalization of parties, an end to martial law and greater press freedom. Islamic fundamentalists, who won the largest bloc of seats, were divided in the first major action of the new <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, splitting their vote for speaker. <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Arar </PERSON>, former interior minister and an ally of the king, defeated a candidate of the conservative Moslem Brotherhood 44-36 with the aid of more - liberal Islamists The government must work with the Islamists to get its legislation passed, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> can block any law he dislikes, either in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or by veto. He also has the power to dissolve the legislature and rule without it. Conservative Islamists _ the <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> and their allies _ campaigned for more social welfare programs, a crackdown on corruption, stricter observance of Islamic law and the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. They seek bans on liquor and the levying of interest, and greater segregation of sexes. Prominent Islamist deputy <PERSON> Yousef </PERSON> <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> said Monday, however, the fundamentalists hope to `` cooperate with the government for the interest of the country and its citizens.'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> repeated his support for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and its steps toward peace, and declared to the assembly: `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is the side that continues to thwart progress.'' About half the 3 million people in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> are Palestinians, many of them refugees displaced by the creation of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` The only solution to the Palestinian problem lies in recognizing Palestiniian rights on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> national soil,'' the king told the legislators. He reported progress toward overcoming problems caused by its foreign debt of $ 8.3 billion, which led in April to four days of rioting in southern <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> reorganized the government and moved toward democratic reform after the riots.

 Actress <PERSON> Claudette </PERSON> <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> says her success at funny nice-girl roles probably blocked her from saucier parts. The 86-year-old star of the 1934 romantic comedy `` It Happened One Night'' and 61 other pictures told Fame magazine in its December-January issue that there's `` nothing less interesting than a goody-goody, and I played a lot of them.'' `` The difficulty was that they made money on my comedies and never thought of me as doing the other thing, which I could do. The best thing to play is a bitch, a bitch with a heart of gold,'' said <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON>, who will receive the Kennedy Center Award from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a nationally televised program Dec. 3, says she is surprised she has remained so well known worldwide. `` Maybe it's because of my funny-shaped face,'' she said.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> formally recognized Monday the right of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to evolve a political system free of outside interference. In a joint declaration at the end of a five-day visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s non-Communist government, the two nations expressed their concerns about a reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> welcomed the developing democratic landscape in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> but voiced the conviction that the relationship between the two Germanys must respect the border between East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Maintenance of the border has `` an unusually important significance for the maintenance of stability and security in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' the statement said. Both the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> suffered deeply from Nazi aggression during World War II and Polish officials have expressed concern about the potential emergence of a powerful unified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the heart of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s election Aug. 24 ended more than 40 years of Communist rule in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and has contributed to opening the way for other East European nations to introduce democratic reforms. The moves have the support of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who says they are necessary for <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to catch up to the West. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a former Solidarity editor and close adviser to <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, exchanged views on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc with Soviet leaders, concluding that the process of democratization is allowing the nations the freedom to choose their own form of government. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are to develop `` as before, their alliance relations on the basis of mutual trust, recognizing the free choice of the development of the social-political path, full reciprocity and non-interference in internal affairs,'' it said. `` They are determined to develop good-neighborliness and alliance relations between the two countries on the basis of new political thinking,'' the document said. It formalized the Soviet guarantee that it would not interfere in the internal affairs of its East European neighbors, even if they chose to reject communism. The primary Polish aim of the visit was to gain public Soviet acceptance of the new government, many of whose members come from the Solidarity free trade union movement. Apart from developments in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the visit focused on economic issues, the question of historical `` blank spots'' _ parts of history the communist authorities have rewritten or suppressed _ and the situation of the estimated 2 million Soviet citizens of Polish origin. The statement said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was ready to maintain its supply of oil and raw materials in exchange for delivery of Polish manufactured goods. Both sides agreed to coordinate future development of trade as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> converts its centrally planned economy to a market-oriented system. Trade with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> accounts for one-third of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s foreign trade. The hopes of many Poles for a clear <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> statement on the massacre of 4,300 Polish officers in the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> forest in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> during Wold War II were not met. Most Poles and Western historians believe the officers were murdered by the Soviet secret police in 1940. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> says the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> were guilty. On Sunday, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> made an emotional visit to the forest, about 250 miles west of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and took part in a Roman Catholic Mass in honor of the dead. The statement said both countries believe that clarification of historical issues _ and above all, the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> question _ would strengthen their ties. The two countries also agreed to create conditions to improve the situation of Poles living in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Poles will be guaranteed the right to develop schools to teach the Polish language, create their own cultural societies and be able to attend church services. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> on Monday to meet with intellectuals in a city with which <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> had close ties before the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Some of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s most prominent poets, lawyers and political activists of the 19th century studied in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, as the city was known then, and <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s advisers say he is interested in reviving the ties. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was applauded warmly by about 50 intellectuals when he encouraged them to develop independent political and cultural initiatives.

 President-elect <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gained ground in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but fell short of a majority, said Monday he would try to form a coalition government. His center-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won 37.4 percent of the votes in Sunday's general elections, compared with 28.8 percent for the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has been in power; 19.7 for the <ORGANIZATION> Broad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>; and smaller totals for five other parties, according to official count of 90.4 percent of returns. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION> also are center-right. The Broad Front alliance is leftist and includes the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and former Tupamaro guerrillas who tried to overthrow a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> government in the late 1960s. <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON>'s party was was projected to win 12 of the 30 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats and 38 places in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, which has 99 members. He said meetings will be held this week to build `` a governing coalition, which we ... consider indispensible for the correct functioning of the government.'' Taking a customary morning stroll beside a beach near his home, the president-elect said: `` I'm aware the task that awaits me is very difficult ... but I always knew that.'' President <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Batlle </PERSON>, the party's unsuccessful presidential candidate, indicated support for a coalition. <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>, who was barred by law from seeking another term and remains in office until March 1, said he did not `` see any particular inconvenience'' in opening the coalition to the <ORGANIZATION> Broad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Liber </PERSON> <PERSON> Seregni </PERSON>, the Front's presidential candidate, told <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON> his party `` is disposed to talk ... in the search for solutions our country needs.'' <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, a small South American republic between <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, suffers from chronic inflation and economic stagnation. A modest recovery occurred during <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>'s five-year term, but wages and pensions remain low, the cost of living has risen 82 percent this year and the gross national product of $ 8 billion improved by only about 1 percent. Public services in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> were a model for the continent in the 1950s. Now schools and hospitals are deteriorating, and electricity and gas are so expensive many people must use them sparingly. <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON>, a 48-year-old senator, pledged in his campaign to curtail inflation by negotiating a reduction of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s $ 6.3 billion foreign debt, thus freeing more public funds for other uses. He proposes to sell some of the 3 million ounces of gold reserves and invest the money to earn interest. Areas in which talks with the Broad Front may founder are the foreign debt and <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON>'s plans for deregulation and getting the government out of an economy it has directed for decades. Labor and leftist political parties oppose paying the debt, and fear selling state enterprises over to private owners may result in pay cuts and the loss of jobs. `` We say we do n't have to pay one cent'' of the foreign debt, said <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Marenales </PERSON>, a founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Tupamaros </ORGANIZATION>. `` That money should be invested in the country.''

 A reduction in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is an option President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will bring to his meeting with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, a White House spokesman said today. But press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration does not want to `` get the cart in front of the horse'' in discussing any such reductions prematurely, and before consulting with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. `` Any actions that we would suggest or recommend would only be with the appoval of our allies,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also will raise with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the Dec. 2-3 shipboard summit the issue of continued shipments of Soviet-bloc arms to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. He noted that among weapons found over the weekend in the debris of a crashed Nicaraguan aircraft destined for a Salvadoran rebel base `` were Soviet-made SA-7 missiles.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` will tell President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that the introduction of surface-to-air weapons in a guerrilla war in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> is a dangerous escalation of a conflict, contrary to high-level Soviet assurances,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` Despite Soviet promises to use their influence for peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, it is clear the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and their Marxist allies continue to destabilize the legitimate democracies of the region,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Conventional force reduction in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will remain the subject for ongoing international negotiations, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Noting the nation's tight budget posture, he said, `` if there are arms control agreements or changes in military posture ... that allow us to make defense spending cuts, we certainly are willing to do that.'' Responding to reports that the upheaval in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> could lead to major cuts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense spending, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` Certainly the two presidents in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> will talk about arms control and military force structure. Those discussions will bear on future decisions about changes in our own military posture.'' Asked whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to bring troop cuts to the table at <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` The president will have in his mind all of the options that are available to him. The president wants to be in a postion to discuss the situation with the Soviet leader, to be responsive and to be in a positon to then go to our allies and say, here's what our discussion produced.'' `` As the president considers the budget, as he considers all of the options that might be available to us as a result of the reduction of Soviet force strength, there are all kinds of numbers floating around,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added. The events in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are expected to dominate next weekend's superpower summit, although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also will be discussing arms control, trade and regional conflicts from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.

The Friends of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON>'s organization, published a full-page paid ad in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s leftist newspaper As-Safir. `` To the people who are holding our friend <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, we appeal to you to allow him contact with his family, through whatever means you choose,'' it said. Ms. <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> said she wants evidence the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> is working for the hostages. `` For 3 -LCB- years we have had nothing but words,'' she said. `` When someone important like <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> is among the hostages you would imagine the government moving heaven and earth to get them out. `` But that has n't happened. They have just one person keeping an eye on the hostage situation. The government is just standing by and letting it happen. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is tolerating what is happening to <PERSON> John </PERSON> and the other hostages,'' Ms. <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said several <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> officials are following up every lead. `` As Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said only one week ago, we continue to make every effort to secure his release and the release of the other hostages,'' said the spokesman. He added that <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> would meet with Ms. <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> as soon as his schedule allowed, probably after the New Year holiday. The Friends of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> was formed six months after he disappeared, and Ms. <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON>, also a TV journalist, has been waging a campaign on <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s behalf. It includes fund-raising, demonstrations and 150 billboards around <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that say: `` Close your eyes and think of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> has been doing nothing else for three years.'' The billboards and a TV commercial were produced for free by the advertising agency <ORGANIZATION> Bartle </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bogle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hegarty </PERSON>. `` There's a very strong feeling by people in the media to use whatever talents they have to help and this is what we can do best,'' said <PERSON> Stef </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiratelli </PERSON>, the executive responsible for the ad campaign. `` Inch by inch we have made progress,'' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON>, an opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker involved with the campaign. `` Two years ago the government insisted there was no link with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the hostages and that has changed.'' Ms. <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> said she is sure she'll see <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> again. `` Other people have been released after a long time and they're OK,'' she said `` They're in bad shape but they're OK, which gives me hope.''

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The country's main anti-apartheid alliance Monday called for an internationally supervised inquiry into allegations a police death squad assassinated government opponents. The Mass Democratic Movement, a coalition of opposition groups, said the inquiry should examine the possible complicity of top-ranking government officials, including Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> and President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>. The movement also demanded the dismantling of the security branch of the national police force. Without such steps, the movement said, `` a few individuals will be made scapegoats, while the biggest criminals _ those in command _ will be able to continue ` business as usual.''' The movement said the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jurists </ORGANIZATION> should send prominent judges from overseas to participate in an inquiry of the allegations, based on recent claims by three former police officers that they were involved in a death squad. <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Coetzee </PERSON>, a white former police captain, told the anti-apartheid newspaper Free Weekly he commanded a squad of black constables that carried out assassinations in the early 1980s. His statements meshed in many respects with those of two black former officers: <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Tshikalange </PERSON>, who like <PERSON> Coetzee </PERSON> has fled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Butana </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofomela </PERSON>, who is on Death Row and received a stay of execution after making his allegations in an affidavit obtained by human rights lawyers. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Lothar </PERSON> <PERSON> Neethling </PERSON>, one of the police officials implicated by <PERSON> Coetzee </PERSON>, on Monday demanded a printed apology and $ 200,000 in damages from Free Weekly, saying the newspaper had defamed him and placed his life in danger. The newspaper quoted <PERSON> Coetzee </PERSON> as saying <PERSON> Neethling </PERSON>, commander of the police forensic laboratories, had concocted a poison for use in political assassinations. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, in interviews published over the weekend by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, said the charges would be `` investigated right to the core, to ensure that all the facts come to the table.'' `` I will not stand for this sort of thing,'' he said. `` If the allegations prove to be true, there will be action.'' However, the <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> said the entire government, including <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, must be forced to account for the allegedly broad scope of death squad activity. `` Recent circumstantial evidence tends to confirm our belief that there has been government complicity at every level in the operation of these death squads,'' the movement said. `` Wide-ranging and drastic action is needed to put an end to these apartheid crimes.'' There have been widespread calls for the appointment of a judicial commission to investigate the allegations, but the <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> said the participation of overseas judges and South African human rights lawyers would be needed to ensure that government-appointed South African judges on the commission pursued their task effectively. The movement demanded the government compensate the families of activists allegedly killed by death squads. It also said South African diplomats should be expelled from countries where South Afican security officials were suspected of having carried out `` international terrorism.''

<DATELINE>BAABDA, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Christian army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> rejected an ultimatum to leave the presidential palace, and said Monday he would die fighting, even with `` kitchen knives, sticks and stones.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> told a news conference in his bunker beneath the shell-battered palace east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> that he was recruiting volunteers to meet a possible assault by the 40,000 Syrian soldiers stationed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Military sources discounted reports of military buildups in mountains above the palace in the <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> suburb, and along the line that divides Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> from the Christian eastern sector. A ranking Moslem army officer said privately: `` There is absolutely no move on the ground to suggest that a collision is imminent.'' He said the `` fronts are as they have been since the cease-fire'' that began Sept. 22, ending six months of fighting between the Syrians and the 20,000 men of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Christian army units. <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, the newly elected president who gave <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> the ultimatum, issued a statement at his temporary headquarers in the Syrian-controlled <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Chtoura </LOCATION> urging Christian troops to support him. `` Gen. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> is placing the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> nation at an impossible, destructive and reckless option that leads only to the underground shelters ... while the presidency has decided to lead the nation out of the death mill to peace,'' said <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, a Maronite Catholic like <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. `` It is the legitimate government's right to employ all means and potenial to recover what has been usurped from it.'' On Sunday, the president gave <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> 48 hours to leave the palace. In his bunker, the 54-year-old general said sarcastically Monday that <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> should have been `` considerate enough to make it 72 hours, to give me enough time to pack and leave.'' `` Mr. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> has no forces of his own to fight me with,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said. `` He will have to rely on <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s occupation forces.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> calls the Syrian soldiers an occupation army and has declared a `` war of liberation'' to drive them out. The Syrians are in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976, one year after the beginning of a sectarian civil war that has taken more than 150,000 lives. The Syrians `` have the means to attack me from the air,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said. `` I might be killed in such an air attack. I am going to die fighting. I'll fight even with kitchen knives, sticks and stones to defend <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s honor.'' He said he had opened recruitment centers `` all over the free -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- areas to take volunteers to share in the final battle for the defense of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' he said, and accused <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> of wanting to `` eliminate <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON>, 22, said outside the palace he had volunteered, along with at least 8,000 other young Christians. That number could not be confirmed. After President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s six-year term ended in September 1988 with <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> unable to agree on a successor, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> led a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in competition with a Moslem government for 14 months. He rejected <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s election Friday as unconstitutional, as he had the election of President <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, who was killed Wednesday, 17 days after he was sworn in. By unwritten covenant followed since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s president is a Maronite, the prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker a Shiite Moslem. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has denied Syrian charges that he was behind the attack on Mouawad. On Monday, he repeated his own accusation that the Syrians killed <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, who was their staunch ally. The general also opposed <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s approval of a peace plan _ worked out by the legislators in weeks of negotiations at <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> _ that is designed to give Moslems an equal share of power. Christians were the majority in 1943 and have dominated the government, army and judiciary since, but Moslems now make up about 55 percent of the population. Reporters who went to the bunker saw an anti-aircraft battery at the palace entrance and soldiers pouring mud, as camouflage, on an armored personnel carrier and a tank. Western journalists who toured Souk el-Gharb and Dhour el-Shweir, the main gateways to <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> from Syrian-controlled east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said they did not see Syrian reinforcements. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, 64, said Sunday he was determined to govern from the palace, the traditional seat of presidents. `` Whatever is left of <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, even if it is one room, when this situation is over it will be my residence,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today it lodged a strong protest with the Soviet Embassy concerning the `` dangerous escalation'' created by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s alleged attempt to ship Soviet-bloc weaponry to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Department spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the Central American issue, as a result of the abortive weapons delivery attempt, will become a prime area of discussion when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> meets with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Dec. 2-3 in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. The protest note deplores the `` dangerous escalation of conflict, contrary to Soviet assurances,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. She added that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will press the Soviets `` to take action to ensure their allies -LRB- <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> -RRB- cease this outrageous behavior.'' The note was delivered the Soviet charge d'affaires at 7 p.m. Saturday by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmitt </PERSON>, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, and <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, the assistant secretary for inter-American affairs. Delivery of the note on a Saturday evening reflected the concern with which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> views the weapons shipment, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. The note was sent just hours after Salvadoran military authorities said they discovered two light planes in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> that were delivering shoulder-fired missiles to the leftist rebels.

<HEAD>Turtle Or Egg? Appeal Should Answer Question</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When does a sea turtle egg become a turtle? That twist on the old chicken-egg debate is at the heart of an appeal by a man convicted of poaching more than 1,000 sea turtle eggs. Some species of sea turtles are endangered, so state law treats offenses against turtle life harshly. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bivens </PERSON> was found guilty in March, sentenced to 60 days in jail and fined $ 500, plus $ 100 for each egg taken from the beach at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Singer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, for a total fine of $ 109,300. <PERSON> Bivens </PERSON>' appeal claims the fine is illegal because state law allows a judge to levy a $ 100 fine `` per unit of marine life.'' `` An egg, according to the facts of nature that an egg becomes a life when it is hatched ... is not a turtle,'' <PERSON> Bivens </PERSON>' lawyer wrote in court briefs. `` Hence the universal question: Which came first, the chicken or the egg?'' Oral arguments on the appeal are set for Jan. 18. Prosecutors and wildlife officials say the argument is a new one to them, but ridiculous nevertheless. `` If you kill an egg, it's not going to become a turtle, obviously,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, sea turtle recovery coordinator for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Bivens </PERSON> thinks the laws concerning turtles are too vague. `` Just as a chicken is not an egg -LRB- and when one eats eggs for breakfast, one is not eating chicken -RRB-, a marine turtle is not a turtle until it comes out of its egg,'' Assistant Public Defender <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carres </PERSON> wrote on <PERSON> Bivens </PERSON>' behalf. `` Most of -LRB- the eggs -RRB- do n't even turn into turtles,'' said the public defender, although he did not know what percentage of sea turtle eggs usually hatch. <PERSON> Carres </PERSON> did not defend his client's motive, saying he was `` probably up to no good'' when caught with the eggs and should have been fined $ 500 for having them.

 Three avowed revolutionaries were cleared this morning of trying to overthrow the government but the jury was still considering racketeering complaints. After 18 days of deliberations, the jury was allowed to return its partial verdict after it told District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> it was unable to decide whether two of the defendants were guilty of racketeering. The jury also said it could n't decide whether the two and the third defendant, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON>, were guilty of racketeering conspiracy for their roles in a series of bombings and robberies that began in 1976. The government had contended the incidents were part of a plot to overthrow the government of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and as such constituted seditious conspiracy, a charge rarely used since the Civil War. The judge had urged the jury to try and reach agreement on the remaining racketeering charges but the jury responded that it was quitting for the day and would resume deliberations Tuesday. Prosecutors allege <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> were members of a terrorist band that robbed banks and bombed buildings along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> from the mid-1970s to 1984. The trial began in January and jurors got the case Nov. 6, working through many weekends. The jury took just one day off for the Thanksgiving holiday. Defense attorneys have argued that the charges are vague and that there were other groups operating at the time the defendants are alleged to have plotted against the government. Jurors have asked to review some physical evidence in the case, including footprint charts and testimony from a currency analyst in connection with one of the alleged bank robberies. They also have asked for help in defining a seditious enterprise. Lawyers are reluctant to speculate what was happening in the jury room, or how long a verdict on the other charges might take. Some legal observers have said the lengthy deliberations are to be expected, considering that the trial has taken 11 months and included testimony from about 200 witnesses. When the trial began, the defendants described themselves as `` North American anti-imperialists who believe armed resistance is one of the necessary responses to apartheid, racism, sexism, the massacres of Native Peoples and capitalist-backed wars.'' There were seven defendants at the time of the initial jury selection in March 1988. Prosecutors dropped charges against <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Laaman </PERSON>, already serving lengthy sentences on other charges. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, pleaded guilty to sedition and other charges, and a separate trial was ordered for <PERSON> Laaman </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Curzi-Laaman </PERSON>.

 A gunfight between relatives of two women feuding over boyfriends claimed a young victim _ a 3-year-old boy in a parked car whose mother tried to shield him from the gunfire. Two men were charged Monday with murder, police spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was fatally wounded Sunday when the two groups fought on a street in a north Mobile neighborhood, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said. The slain boy's mother, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, 28, had stopped her car at a relative's home where they planned to have lunch. When she heard the gunfire, she reached for the boy, who was seated in the front of the car, but a bullet shattered the windshield and killed him, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, who was not involved in the feuding, was treated for shock at a hospital. The slaying followed a bar fight Saturday night between the two women; the feud had been simmering for three weeks, police said. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, 40, was charged with murder Sunday when he came to the police station to ask about the incident, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said.

 The Berlin Wall that for years was a symbol of communism is rapidly entering the capitalist marketplace as entrepeneurs hawk chunks of it as the perfect Christmas gift. Impromptu businesses around the country are shipping the rubble of demolished sections of the wall to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and selling pieces in stores, by telephone, by mail order and on the street. `` One of our retailers says the two hottest items this Christmas will be pieces of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and the dancing flowers,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>, vice president of sales and marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Hyman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> in this <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburb. `` The dancing flower is just a joke, but this is not to be taken as a joke. We offer this because it has commemorative value for all time,'' <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> said. `` There are some very real feelings associated with it. It stands for oppression and hardship and we try to respect that,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnur </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> vice president of finance. <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> will package two-ounce pieces of concrete from the 22 sections of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall that have been knocked down since <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> opened the barrier between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The chunks, for sale through department store chains, come in boxes with certificates of authenticity. Service Merchandise stores and the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> May </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have commitments to sell wall chunks, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> also is talking to <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdales </ORGANIZATION>' main <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> store has taken 200 rocks to test demand, buyer <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandolfo </PERSON> said The chunks are expected to sell for $ 10. <PERSON> Schnur </PERSON> said his company has the most abundant supply of wall rubble _ 35 tons _ and plans on shipping in up to an additional 15 tons. Other wall-dealing ventures include B & amp; P Imports, a company formed by a house painter and a car salesman in <LOCATION> Munster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. B & amp; P has been taking about 300 requests a day by phone and by mail. Co-owner <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said his company has sold about 500 pounds of concrete already. Authenticating the chunks is costly, and <ORGANIZATION> B </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P partner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> acknowledged that someone could fraudulently sell ordinary concrete chunks as pieces of the wall. `` Actually if somebody wanted to do it, they probably could. It's just a matter of morals,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said. `` We have three pieces of paper with ours _ a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> declaration, an affidavit of authenticity and the shipping papers. People are real willing to believe us, they just want some measure of proof.'' <ORGANIZATION> Jameson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which produces and sells radio programming, sent 5,000 nugget-size pieces to nearly 100 stations in all 50 states as well as stations in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. WLLZ-FM, a <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON> client in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area, gave 25 chunks to listeners who sent requests by facsimile machine saying why they wanted the pieces, and 25 to callers. One listener, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldier who served at the wall, wanted `` a piece of the miracle _ something he thought he'd never see.'' The distributors say most people want a piece of the wall for the historic value. `` I'm 36 and anyone who spent part of their childhood in the early'60s will be able to relate to the idea of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> wall and what it stood for,'' <PERSON> Schnur </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> said he would bury the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> made his speech in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, there were air-raid drills, bomb shelters ... the wall coming down signals an end to that era.'' <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> appeared on a radio show recently and said one listener called the station and asked how to get a chunk of the wall. `` The person said one of their relatives died trying to get across the wall,'' he said. The companies would n't disclose their costs; some have n't seen the bills yet for shipping the rubble from <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said shipping runs about $ 4 a pound. And they wo n't reveal the contacts that enabled them to acquire parts of the wall. `` My partner had to have a lot of contacts for this to happen,'' <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> said. `` But it's still going on right now and I would n't want to jeopardize our returns.'' B & amp; P admitted: `` We get it from a friend there. Actually, it's vandalism.

 Despite the easing of <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> tensions, European defense ministers Monday urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to remain strongly committed to the defense of their continent. The ministers, representing European members of the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, welcomed the rapid changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but cautioned the allies should keep up their guard. `` We ... need to be careful,'' said <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> Defense Minister <PERSON> Narcis </PERSON> <PERSON> Serra </PERSON>, who is president of the Eurogroup, made up of a dozen European nations in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. The statement comes amid reports the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is planning sharp cuts in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s budget. The reports have raised concern about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' future ties to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> for Tuesday's start of a two-day meeting of alliance defense ministers at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> said the European defense chiefs put off until Tuesday discussions of possible <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense cuts, wanting to hear first-hand from <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> promised that no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops would be pulled out of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> without an East-West agreement on reducing conventional, or non-nuclear, arms, the Dutch government said. Dutch Defense Minister <PERSON> Relus </PERSON> ter <PERSON> Beek </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> as saying he expected the conventional arms talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to be followed by another round of disarmament negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. `` Withdrawal of ... American troops from the European continent will take place -LRB- only -RRB- after a -LRB- conventional arms -RRB- agreement,'' <PERSON> ter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beek </PERSON> said after meeting with <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. According to the Dutch official, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s budget-cutting work would not affect the Western alliance before a conventional arms pact was reached The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is drawing up plans to cut planned increases in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spending by $ 180 billion in the 1992-94 budget years. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 340,000 troops based in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, most of them in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> was quoted in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> newspapers as saying that more cuts in American forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> than now under consideration may be possible because of the `` erosion'' of the Soviet military threat. The stunning political reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have prompted talk of a reduced _ or different _ role for the military alliances in the future. But the European defense ministers cautioned that `` periods of rapid change and transformation may ... carry risks of their own.'' Even after promised arms reductions by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact still will `` retain military forces which substantially outnumber those of the alliance in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' the ministers said. The presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear and conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` remains vital to the security of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, just as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s security is vital to that of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the ministers said `` We therefore reaffirm the high priority that we attach to the continuing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to the defense of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' They called for a successful conclusion of the conventional arms talks. `` We need a prompt agreement at <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials expect an accord to be completed next year. Such an agreement would lead to hefty cuts in tanks, armored troop carriers and artillery pieces in an area spanning the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in May urged big reductions in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops stationed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by 1993. The European officials also said there have been improvements in some contributions to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. The subject has been a sore point in the alliance. Critics in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> complain that some European members do n't do enough for the Western defense while <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> does too much. But the Europeans said <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> have increased planned defense spending, and that <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for the first time agreed to contribute to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s military budget. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers meet twice a year in their role as the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which is outside <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s military structure, does not attend <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, which has no armed forces, has observer status.

<TEXT>
 A Colombian jet with 107 people aboard crashed in flames today outside <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, and officials said all on board were killed. A caller to a radio station claimed drug traffickers bombed the jet. Witnesses reported seeing the <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727-100 explode before it plummeted to the ground at about 7:15 a.m. Hours later, a person called the <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> radio network and said The Extraditables, a shadowy group linked to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel, bombed the plane because police informants were on board. The caller did not identify himself, and there was no way to authenticate the claim. The airline refused comments on reports the plane exploded. Col. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Leal </PERSON>, chief of national police in the state, said investigators had not found anything to indicate a bomb blew it up. Avianca spokeswoman <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said the plane crashed into a hilly area just south of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, the capital. She said all 101 passengers and six crew members were killed. <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> radio quoted officials at the control tower at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> as saying the jet crashed three minutes after taking off for the city of <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, 190 miles to the southwest. It quoted the flight controller as saying the pilot reported everything normal seconds before communication with the plane was lost. `` The plane exploded in the air and then fell to the ground and caused a huge explosion,'' said <PERSON> Jairo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alba </PERSON>, who witnessed the crash. <PERSON> Alba </PERSON>, interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION>, said the jet was destroyed. Radio stations quoted other witnesses as saying they saw smoke pouring from one of the three engines and then seeing the plane blow up. `` The plane was flying along when suddenly it exploded, broke in two and fell in flames and smoke,'' witness <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. `` I heard explosions and I thought there was some problem with transformers in the electrical station, but I looked up and saw a plane explode in the air, and bodies and pieces of luggage were falling,'' another witness <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, said. The chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, Col. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, said the crew of a Colombian air force jet flying in the area saw two explosions on the jet. He spoke to the radio networks RCN and <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. No one on the ground appeared to have been hurt, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> said Flight 203 just cleared the southern edge of this city of 6 million when it crashed. Witnesses said wreckage was scattered for miles. The nationalities of those on board were not immediately known. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> said the company would send investigators to <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> to help determine the cause of the crash. The government of President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> declared war on drug traffickers in August, and since then there have been several bombings and other attacks, but none on a large scale. The person who claimed responsibility on behalf of the Extraditables said six informants on the plane were targeted because they gave police information that led to the discovery of the hiding place of the head of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel. The Extraditables take their name from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s list of 12 Colombian drug suspects most wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The head of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, tops the list. Last week, authorities raided a jungle hideout, and <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> reportedly came close to capture. The last major passenger jet crash in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> occurred March 17, 1988, when an <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727-100 crashed into a mountain near the northern city of <LOCATION> Zulia </LOCATION>, killing 138 people. On July 27, 1985, an air force transport plane crashed in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle, killing all 74 people aboard. The military plane was carrying passengers because of a airline strike.

<TEXT>
 Thirteen blacks, including three policemen, have been killed in the latest outbreak of factional fighting and political unrest in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> province, police said Monday. Six policemen have been killed in the province in the past week. Police have not said whether the attacks on the policemen were connected, and the report of other killings Sunday gave few details. Feuding among political groups, rural clans, and criminal gangs have claimed more than 3,000 lives in the Zulu areas of <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> in the past three years. Most of the fighting has been between supporters of <LOCATION> Inkatha </LOCATION> _ a Zulu political organization headed by <PERSON> Mangosuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> _ and members of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a multiracial organization. The Front supporters oppose the participation of <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> and Inkatha in the <ORGANIZATION> KwaZulu </ORGANIZATION> homeland government; <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> condemns the Front's use of boycotts and encouragement of economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> also opposes the guerrilla tactics of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which is affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. African <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, recently freed from prison, blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> violence on the government's policy of dividing blacks into tribal homelands. In a speech Sunday in <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION>, the homeland of the Xhosa people, <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> said: `` The policy of divide and rule is one which we will destroy.'' He said the frequently interrupted attempts to bring the <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> factions together in peace talks had been `` resuscitated.'' Police headquarters in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> said Monday that 10 black civilians had been killed in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> in the past 24 hours. Also, police said, a black municipal policeman was hit on the head with a blunt instrument and killed Sunday in the township of <LOCATION> Steadville </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Ladysmith </LOCATION>; a black sergeant was shot to death by three blacks as he got into his car after visiting a colleague in <LOCATION> Gamalakhe </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shepstone </LOCATION> on Saturday night; and a reserve constable was surrounded by a group of 15 blacks and stabbed to death as he left a rural homestead near <LOCATION> Inanda </LOCATION> on Friday night. The report said most of the violence occurred at <LOCATION> KwaMashu </LOCATION>, a black township on the outskirts of the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, where 25,000 people had marched to the police station Sunday to present a petitition accusing the police of brutality. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> supporters say most <ORGANIZATION> KwaZulu </ORGANIZATION> police favor <ORGANIZATION> Inkatha </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> is the chief of the homeland police. Police did not say whether the violence preceded or followed the march, but one man was found stabbed to death, one beaten to death and two burnt to death. A black constable, defending himself against a crowd, fired birdshot, killing a man, police said. Two other men and a 15-year-old boy were stabbed by crowds in three separate incidents, police said. Unknown attackers shot or stabbed to death other black men in several townships in the province, police said.

 Workers tested pipelines of a 22-mile rural water system Monday to find a leak that has deprived as many as 400 families of water for nearly two weeks. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> and volunteer firefighters trucked in water Sunday for use by customers of the <ORGANIZATION> Nellieburg-Tanglewood-Suqualena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> west </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> after county officials declared an emergency, said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Metrolis </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Lauderdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> agency. `` They obviously have a problem on the system somewhere. It seems to be a gigantic leak,'' <PERSON> Metrolis </PERSON> said Monday. More than 5,000 gallons of water for drinking and household use were trucked into the area. The leak apparently sprang Nov. 14, officials said; water pressure declined steadily until some homes lost all water about a week ago.

 Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions taken Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. HANDICAPPED The court refused to let public schools cut off educational help to severely handicapped children even though they may not be able to benefit from such services. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> school district ordered to help a profoundly retarded 13-year-old boy. The case has attracted widespread attention from educators and state and local government officials nationwide who supported the appeal by the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, school district. At issue is the duty of states and local school officials under the federal Education for All Handicapped Children Act, which provides federal aid and in turn requires programs to help such children. The case is <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, vs. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON>, 89-515. HOMELESSNESS The court dealt a blow to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s campaign to halt the spread of homelessness by refusing to revive a local law successfully challenged by developers. The justices, without comment, left intact a ruling that a law banning conversion or demolition of single-room-occupancy housing unconstitutionally confiscates private property. The cases are <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Seawall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, 89-388; Coalition for the Homeless vs. Seawall, 89-403; <PERSON> Wilkerson </PERSON> vs. Seawall, 89-552. STRIP SEARCH The court turned down an appeal by <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> law enforcement officials sued for strip-searching a woman charged with operating her car without proper registration or insurance. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that strip-searching people accused of minor traffic violations generally violates their rights. The case is <PERSON> Frey </PERSON> vs. Masters, 89-576. PIT BULLS The court left intact an <LOCATION> Overland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, ordinance restricting the ownership and possession of `` pit bull dogs.'' The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the city ordinance is unconstitutionally too vague. The case is <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> vs. Overland Park, 89-412. WESTIES The court rejected appeals by four men and a woman convicted for their roles in a hoodlum gang, the Westies, in the Hell's Kitchen section of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the five were prosecuted fairly.

TELEPHONE BILLS The court rejected an appeal by a telephone company ordered to notify customers, along with their monthly bills, of their right to join a lawsuit against the company.

The case is Mountain States Telephone vs. District Court of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, 89-531. KENNEDY The court rejected the appeal of a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, man who sued the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> over its unanimous vote last year favoring Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s appointment to the high court. The court, without comment, let stand rulings that threw out <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s lawsuit. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did not participate in considering <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s appeal or in the court's action today. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s suit contended that the committee's 14 senators violated his rights by voting for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> without investigating allegations of wrongdoing against the nominee. The case is <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, 89-591.

 A woman was in critical condition today after nine hours of surgery to receive a new liver, following a plea from track star <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> to help locate an organ. Hospital officials said <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> was in critical but stable condition following the emergency liver transplant surgery. Doctors put her on a national organ donor list last week, and by Thanksgiving grouped her among patients most urgently in need of transplants. <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, 22, went into surgery at 10:30 p.m. Sunday for the transplant that ended about 7:30 this morning, said <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>. Doctors began monitoring her for signs of transplant rejection or infection. `` At this point, they -LRB- the doctors -RRB- were pleased with it,'' she said. The liver came from an anonymous donor and it was not immediately known if it was the result of <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' appeal. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> pleaded for the liver donor in a desperate attempt to save <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, the sister of a journalist who is helping to write <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' autobiography Earlier, <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> was clinging to life in a coma earlier and doctors gave her 24 hours to live without the operation. <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, the sister of Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, had swelling on her brain and was likely to have irreversible brain damage without an immediate liver transplant, doctors said. `` I am here to ask for help in saving a young woman's life,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> pleaded for a donor Saturday and stayed at the hospital with the <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> family again Sunday, saying the case indicates the `` desperate need'' for organ donors throughout the nation. `` This has hit me like no athletic event ever has,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 28. <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> suffered irreparable liver damage after contracting hepatitis B several weeks ago and has been hospitalized for the past week. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, an Olympic gold medalist in 1984 and 1988, has been active in support of a national donor network. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> family became elated about 10 p.m. Saturday when it seemed a donor had been found. The liver, however, turned out to have been damaged in a car accident.

 Republican <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said today he will seek a recount and contest the results of the governor's race, which he narrowly lost to Democrat <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> by less than half a percentage point In official returns certified today by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> if </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> received 897,139 votes to 890,285 for <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> out of nearly 1.8 million ballots cast for a margin of 6,854 votes, or .38 percent. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s announcement came about three hours before the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> announced the official results of closest gubernatorial election in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> history. The unofficial returns from the Nov. 7 election had shown <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> defeating <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> by 6,852 votes. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said previously he probably would seek a recount if the certified margin of <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s victory was less than one half-percent of the 1.78 million votes cast, or about 9,000 votes. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> had until Dec. 7 to request a recount but today was the deadline for contesting the election to the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> because of alleged irregularities. `` In an election as close as this one, irregularities which would not ordinarily have a probable impact on the outcome assume a greater importance,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said in a letter to leaders of the Democrat-controlled <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitz-Hugh </PERSON>, secretary of the board of elections, said there is no precedent for a statewide recount. She has declined to estimate the length of time or cost of the recount, which would be overseen by a panel of three judges headed by the chief judge of the <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> has distanced himself from debate over whether <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> should accept the certified vote. `` We've said all along the ball is in the loser's court,'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> has proceeded with plans for his inauguration Jan. 13 as <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s third straight Democratic governor, and has named a transition team. The grandson of slaves and former state senator from <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> was elected lieutenant governor in 1985.

 A prosecutor told a judge today he will put officials on the stand to support the state's contention that a former <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> tanker skipper should not escape prosecution for causing the nation's worst oil spill. At a pretrial hearing in the case of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, state Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Linton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he planned to call several <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officers and a state environmental official as witnesses. <PERSON> Linton </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON> that he also planned to put on the stand residents of <LOCATION> Ellamar </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> village from which the <LOCATION> Exxon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> was seen after it became impaled on <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was captain of the 987-foot tanker when it ripped its hull open on the reef early March 24 after leaving the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil pipeline terminal at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. The vessel spilled nearly 11 million gallons of heavy North Slope crude oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. Shortly after the spill, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> fired <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, a veteran mariner from <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hazelwood </LOCATION>, 43, is accused of reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil, all misdemeanors, and three felony counts of criminal mischief. His trial is set for Jan. 22. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s lawyers have said they would try to get his case thrown out on claims of immunity, a flawed sobriety test and other grounds. Defense motions included claims that <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> received immunity from prosecution when he reported his ship's grounding and the oil spill the morning it happened. A law intended to encourage self-reporting of environmental calamities such as oil spills provides protection against self-incrimination, laywers contend. They say virtually every piece of evidence in the case against <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> grew from his report to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> that the Exxon Valdez was aground and leaking oil. <PERSON> Linton </PERSON> said, however, that discovery of the spill was inevitable. He contends the position that <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s informing the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ultimately led to the evidence against him is groundless. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Fairbanks </LOCATION> refused last month to block <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s trial in state court. The oil blackened hundreds of miles of shoreline, killed tens of thousands of birds and marine mammals and disrupted lucrative fishing seasons. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said it spent more than $ 1 billion on oil spill claims and cleanup work, and state officials say the cleanup, suspended for the winter, is unfinished. The case was moved from <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> because of concerns that publicity about the spill would make it too hard to find an impartial jury. The port in south-central <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> relies heavily on the oil industry for jobs and also has commercial fishing interests. If convicted of the three felonies, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> faces a possible maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and $ 100,000 in fines.

 The president dissolved <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, leaving Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and a caretaker government to see <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> through what could be weeks of post-election uncertainty. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had overwhelming control of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, but voters in the world's most populous democracy took it away in three days of elections that began Wednesday, and left the party far short of a majority. To retain power, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must find partners for would be the first coalition government since <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became independent of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. The prime minister, who won a landslide victory for the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> two months after the Oct. 31, 1984, assassination of his mother, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, was leading his own race for re-election to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Vote tabulations put <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ahead of any single opposition group, but not far enough to govern alone. The party of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s grandfather, <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>, has been out of power only once _ for 29 months that began after an election loss in 1977 to an alliance that later came apart. The prime ministers during those 29 months were <PERSON> Moraji </PERSON> <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> took the first step toward a coalition Monday by dissolving <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, on the Cabinet's recommendation Parliament normally is dissolved before elections, but Indian law does not require it. Growing opposition to <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s leadership was reported within his party. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants to win anything, the prime minister must go,'' said <PERSON> Bhabani </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>, an independent analyst. `` With <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, very few things are possible. Without <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, many things are possible.'' When all votes are counted, the president probably will ask the party with the most seats to try assemble a majority in the 543-seat <LOCATION> Lok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sabha </LOCATION>, or House of People, the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> where the power lies. Many opposition leaders argued the president should turn to the party or alliance with the most popular support, regardless of the number of seats involved. The two largest opposition groups, the five-party <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bharatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Indian People's -RRB- Party, opened talks on a forming a coalition. <PERSON> Yashwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinha </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dal </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the main group in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> will form the next government. `` Our position will be quite clear in the next two or three days. We will know who will be in the ... government, who the leader will be, and we will approach the president and tell him that we are in a position to form the next government.'' State TV compiled results from the <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. By Monday night, winners were known for 400 of the 525 seats at stake in the elections held Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its smaller allies had 193 seats, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> 89. The opposition alliance is led by <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member and trusted <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister. <ORGANIZATION> Bharatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION>, which wants to transform <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> from a secular to a Hindu state, had 70 seats. The others went to smaller parties and independent candidadtes. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 58, was expected to win his constituency in northern <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state, but the count was delayed by floods. Both <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bharatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> dismissed the possibility of a coalition between them. `` We will contemptuously reject any overtures,'' said <PERSON> Anand </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is not in a tearing hurry. We refuse to think of compromising on principles to form the government. We do not go to anybody to seek support.'' He acknowledged `` something did go wrong'' in the election, but insisted the party was solidly behind <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lal </PERSON> <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> <PERSON> Advani </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Bharatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` I will not make deals with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. I will see to it that they fall from power.'' His party won only two seats in 1984. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, a former airline pilot, was carried to power a wave of sympathy after Sikh bodyguards killed his mother, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> captured an unprecedented 415 seats in the <LOCATION> Lok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sabha </LOCATION>. Euphoria greeted his promises to moderize the nation of 880 million people and prepare it for the 21st century, but soon was dispelled by allegations of corruption and ineptitude in <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s government Most corruption reports teemmed from newspaper investigations of alleged kickbacks in a 1986 deal with <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION>, the Swedish arms manufacturer. Several papers claimed <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> paid up to $ 50 million in kickbacks to get a $ 1.4 billion artillery contract. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> denied such payments were made, but could not shake the scandal.

 The Communist Party daily Pravda, in its loudest praise so far for the political changes in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, on Monday called it a `` natural and appropriate'' process of renewal. The Pravda commentary also indicted the old <LOCATION> Czechoslovak </LOCATION> leadership for letting its chance to oversee reform go by, saying it `` waited, vacillated, for every step forward made one step back.'' In a similar vein, <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON> said the government hopes the growing dialogue among political groups in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> `` will further the renewal of socialism in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>.'' Asked about the absence in the Soviet press of a congratulatory telegram from President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to the new head of the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON> dismissed it as having no significance. he lack of the customary telegram could have been construed as a sign of disfavor. But <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON> attributed it to logistical problems, saying `` the telegram is on the way and will be published, so there is nothing dramatic'' in its delay. He also indicated the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> wo n't reject the 1968 Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to crush the `` Prague Spring'' reform until the Czechoslovak leadership does its own historical revision. `` If there is to be a re-evaluation, it has to be a re-evaluation by everyone,'' <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON> said. Pravda concluded that `` <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> is once again on a crossroads. There, the natural and appropriate process of the renewal of socialism, which started earlier in other countries of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, is taking place.'' Correspondent <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vtorushin </PERSON> commented that <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> has the advantage of being able to look to the other Eastern European reforms _ in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> _ to profit from their experience. Soviet TV repeatedly has broadcast footage of the hundreds of thousands of protesters in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s streets and newspapers have carried accounts of the leadership reshuffle as well.

The decision to invite <PERSON> Nyerere </PERSON> to join him as co-chairman of the main talks was the last of 12 agenda items for the preliminary talks, he said. Delegates from the government and the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> resumed talks last week in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> after agreeing on nine issues in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in September <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said the delegates have now resolved the three remaining issues: a co-chairman, a secretariat and observers. The nations that will be asked to observe future talks on ending 28 years of war will be named this week, when the preliminary talks are expected to end, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Nyerere </PERSON> has been traveling in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and had not yet responded to the requests from both delegations to participate, but added that he expects <PERSON> Nyerere </PERSON> to accept the invitation. `` He has indicated in the past that he would if the invitation came from both sides, and not just from me,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> flew through <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> on Sunday while the negotiating teams took a break. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> met with Sudanese President <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> for 90 minutes. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> helped arrange preliminary peace talks Dec. 1 between <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON>'s government and southern rebels, but he will not be directly involved. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and Ethiopian President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> discussed the <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> talks in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> also met with three members of the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s capital. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> initiated the Ethiopian peace talks in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and he said Sunday that he was pleased with their progress. However, he cautioned that trust is still lacking between the Ethiopians and the Eritreans. `` There were a couple of times when the talks almost broke up when one side or the other announced that they were leaving,'' he said. `` There is still a lot of misunderstanding, a lot of mistrust.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he can not guarantee the success of the main negotiations, but added: `` If I did n't think there was hope, I would n't be spending my time out here.''

 An <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> physician and his wife, both inflicted with multiple sclerosis, were saluted by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday as `` an inspiration to us all'' for their volunteer work in running a free medical clinic. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was bestowing his second daily `` Point of Light'' award to Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presented the first award to the Memphis Commercial Appeal last Wednesday for articles spotlighting outstanding volunteers in the community and said he would issue the recognition daily. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galletta </PERSON>, a White House aide, said that, starting with the <PERSON> Hales </PERSON>, a new recipient would be announced every day but Sunday. `` It is not an awards program as such,'' <PERSON> Galletta </PERSON> said. `` This is just recognition.

<TEXT>
 Here are some details of the procedure for Monday's historic operation, in which surgeons sought to remove a portion of a mother's liver and transplant it in her ailing 21-month-old daughter. Times are Central Standard. _ 7:35 a.m.: <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a 29-year-old schoolteacher from suburban <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is wheeled unconscious into an operating room at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for removal of a portion of her liver. During the procedure, the surgeon opens the abdominal area, removes the left lobe of the liver _ about one-third of the organ _ and closes the incision with sutures. The portion removed for transplant contains all the blood vessels the liver needs to function properly. After the vessels supplying the lobe have been clamped off, it is filled with chilled liver-preservation solution. This maintains the condition of the liver portion until removal is completed. During this first phase of the two-step procedure, a retractor device used to hold back tissue came loose and damaged Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s spleen `` There was a lot of blood loss'' and doctors had to remove the spleen, said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON>. The complication was not considered a major setback, he said. But it was expected to delay completion of the procedure by three to four hours, <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> said. Doctors had estimated the surgery would take up to nine hours. _ 12 Noon: Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 21 months, was taken into the operating room for preparation. Standard techniques for vascular surgery are used to connect the recipient's arteries with the vessels leading to the new liver. The average patient needs about a pint of blood during surgery. Details on <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON>'s operation were not available, but liver transplants normally take from six to eight hours, <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>European Community Signs Trade Accord with Soviets</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Czechoslovakia, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it has signed a trade and economic cooperation accord with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that goes beyond similar deals signed in the past 14 months with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The pact provides for a gradual lifting of import quotas on Soviet industrial goods by 1995 and cites a dozen areas in which the two sides plan to establish economic cooperation, an <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> source said. These include science and technology, banking, transport, agriculture, environmental protection, energy, raw materials and mining. The accord excludes trade in goods considered to be sensitive militarily, according to the source, who asked not to be identified. He said the agreement calls for reciprocity in trade benefits. `` That is the objective of this accord ... to get an effective access to the Russian market for <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> products,'' the source said. Officials could not give an assessment of the economic impact of the agreement. <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> trade with Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is small. It totaled $ 56 billion in 1987, the last year for which complete figures are available. EC-Soviet trade that year was only $ 24.6 billion. The agreement with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was reached after five days of talks between <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and Soviet negotiators. It must be approved by the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> states and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. That is a formality, however, given the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>'s interest in increasing economic links with <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and getting access to its market of 390 million consumers. The Soviet accord, negotiated in about four months, is the fourth the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> has signed with an East European nation in just over a year. It signed a trade and economic cooperation agreement with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in September 1988; a more limited deal with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> covering only trade in manufactured goods was signed in December 1988; and an agreement with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was signed Sept. 19. These accords follow a June 25, 1988, agreement under which the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> and the Moscow-led <ORGANIZATION> Comecon </ORGANIZATION> trade bloc, after years of ignoring one another, signed a mutual recognition agreement in <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> on Monday also widened market access for farm and textile goods from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Through the measure, which will be in effect only during 1990, the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> suspended import quotas for the two countries that are fixed through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world trade body. In a statement, the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers said the one-year lifting of quotas was an `` exceptional solution to an exceptional problem'' and represents no change in the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>'s overall position on quotas in world trade. The move follows an <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> decision Nov. 6 to increase market access for industrial goods from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers were notified of the agreement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but did not discuss the issue in depth. The Soviet accord goes further than any other deal the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> has signed with an East European nation, notably by subjecting nuclear energy safety and mining to economic cooperation, sources said. Also on Monday, European Community External Relations Commissioner <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> called developments in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> of the last week `` a cause for profound rejoicing throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' `` Political reform and economic liberalization in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> form part of a wider process which, for the first time in more than 40 years, offers to future generations the prospect of a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> no longer riven by division,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> officials said it was too early to speak of a widening of the accord with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The Commission is still negotiating trade and economic cooperation agreements with <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Talks with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are in an `` exploratory'' stage but will likely be speeded up by next week's visit to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> for an accord on trade and economic cooperation. The <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> has broken off talks for closer economic ties with <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in view of its human rights record.

 People who left their hearts in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> can come back for them anytime, the city's mayor said Monday. The city by the bay, hit by a killer earthquake Oct. 17, is eager to welcome visitors again. `` I came to say ` Thank you' to the people of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and the people of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>,'' Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said at a news conference with <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> during his first stop on a three-city tour. He said <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> was the first city to send food after the 7.1-magnitude quake, which killed 67 people and caused $ 7 billion in damages in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, a friend of <LOCATION> Agnos </LOCATION>, sent Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, cheesecake and beer, the visiting mayor said. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said he also came `` to tell people here in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> that we're ready to offer the same kind of hospitality that <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> is famous for.'' Tourism, which is <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s No. 1 business and generates $ 3.4 billion a year, is still reeling from the effects of the quake, he said. Tourism dropped off sharply after the quake, and is about 80 percent of normal, <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said. Media coverage of the quake focused on spectacular damage, and has many potential visitors thinking the entire area was leveled, he said. He noted that the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, which was closed when a 50-foot section of its upper deck fell on the lower deck, has reopened and that traffic is flowing normally. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> also said many people who live in the heavily damaged <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district returned home for Thanksgiving when electricity and gas were restored six weeks ahead of schedule. However, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s homeless population has nearly doubled because many of the hotels with single-occupancy rooms occupied by low-income residents were destroyed, the mayor said. And the city's two elevated freeways will be closed for repairs until at least June, he said. But everything else is back to normal, said <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, who plans to spread the word in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday.

 <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Varga </PERSON>'s hands were almost blue from the cold as he held up one of the hundreds of signs, banners and flags rising from the human sea filling the street in front of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s largest industrial plant. `` We have been waiting for this for years,'' said <PERSON> Varga </PERSON>, a 27-year-old mechanic. `` This is just wonderful.'' He had been in a column of workers, many in stained overalls, that poured into the street after sirens from two fire trucks bedecked with the blue, red and white national flag sounded the beginning of a two-hour general strike. The column joined tens of thousands filling the street to listen to speakers addressing them from atop a flatbed truck. Signs called for free elections, an end to one-party rule and free trade unions. Others greeted the Civic Forum, the opposition group that sprang to life earlier this month after police brutally suppressed a peaceful student demonstration. `` I never voted,'' said <PERSON> Varga </PERSON>, who said he makes about $ 350 a month _ slightly less than the average pay of a blue-collar worker. `` I knew that these elections were always faked.'' On top of the truck-turned-platform, workers mingled with students and actors waiting to speak. Even three policemen wanted to contribute. One after another, they called for a change in the system, drawing rousing cheers and chanted slogans: `` Long live the students!'' `` These are the demands of a free people!'' and `` Thanks to the Forum!'' One worker demanded that all Czechoslovak Communists who helped the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invaders crush the `` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Soring'' reforms be brought to trial. It was at the CKD plant, where <PERSON> Varga </PERSON> works, that the last general strike was proclaimed two days after the invasion of Aug. 21, 1968. Jeers and shouts of `` Shame!'' went up when another speaker cited the name of a CKD worker who was elected to the party's ruling Politburo in a reshuffle of the leadership less than 12 hours earlier `` He is not one of us!'' the crowd chanted. `` This is just the beginning,'' someone in the crowd said as the rally ended with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s national anthem. `` We will continue. Now we will go to <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> for a new demonstration. This is the 11th day,'' he said. `` It's fantastic,'' said a worker who identified himself only as <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. `` Imagine this comes after half a century of no freedom, first under the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and then under the Communists.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said he went to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after the 1968 invasion but returned a year later `` because I was homesick.'' Flags were lowered from many windows of the drab apartment blocks facing the 400-yard-long front of the plant, the largest of the CKD group. Two men stood atop a building, swinging a flag precariously close to the edge of the roof. `` Where is the people's militia?'' someone asked, referring to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s paramilitary force that had been guarding the gates of all factories in recent days. At one point, they were officially reported to have been asked to help police to `` maintain public order'' during the giant demonstrations. `` Have n't seen them,'' was the answer from another bystander. `` But they have sent word that they will never act against the workers.''

 <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON>, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s winning presidential candidate, called Monday for talks with members of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on solving <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' economic crisis. `` The only way to solve the problems of inflation and unemployment is to create an economy that's strong and productive,'' said <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON>, who beat <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> of the incumbent Liberals in elections Sunday. <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON>, a 46-year-old U.S.-trained agricultural economist, also accepted congratulations from minor party candidates and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> on his victory. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> did not make a concession statement. <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON>' inauguration Jan. 27 will mark the first peaceful transition of power to an opposition party in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in 57 years. `` What Hondurans have accomplished should prove to be an inspirational example to other peoples of the region who also seek democracy,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said in an obvious reference to neighboring <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The problem of Central American peace will be one of the first and most difficult to confront <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON>. The country borders <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has long served as a base for U.S.-supported Contras trying to overthrow the Sandinista government. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> broke relations with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on Sunday over arms smuggling to <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s leftist guerrillas, and <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> said he would be willing to participate in a Central American summit if incumbent President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> is agreeable. <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> has said peace is vital to his effort to attract new foreign investment to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> _ there has been no significant new investment in years _ but he suggested no new ideas during the campaign. He has said he supports the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops on training missions for as long as <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> remains unstable. Other problems <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> will face include high unemployment _ estimates put the figure at 1 million in a nation of 5.2 million. War, refugees, inflation, a $ 3.2 billion foreign debt on which no payment has been made this year and an economy closed by protectionism have all combined to leave <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> one of the poorest nations in the hemisphere, with a per capita annual income estimated at $ 500. <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> said in a radio interview Monday that he would not devalue the lempira, which has been pegged at 2-1 against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar since 1918, although the current black market rate is 4-1. However, <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> said he would attempt to install a two-tier system with a 2-1 rate for things like petroleum and medicine, with a free or different rate for other trade. <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON>, a moderate conservative who admires President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s efforts to modernize <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, has also promised to decentralize the government, sell some state-owned companies, cut the budget and create incentives for export and investment. Official vote totals were stalled by computer problems, but unofficial vote totals gathered by radio and television showed <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> with a clear lead over <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>. With about 67 percent of the vote in, <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> had 595,807 votes, or about 50.2 percent, to Liberal <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>' 526,110, or about 44.3 percent. <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> said he believed his party would take 69 or 70 of the unicameral legislature's 130 seats, as well as the mayoralty ot <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, the capital and largest city. The mayoralty of the second-largest city and commercial center, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sula </LOCATION>, was in doubt, but a strong Nationalist showing there showed how deeply <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> had cut into the Liberals' traditional strongholds `` The <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> did n't lose. The people of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> lost,'' said party treasuere <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Maradiaga </PERSON>. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, who reportedly was in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sula </LOCATION>, released no statement Monday.

 Mission Control directed Discovery's astronauts to remain in space at least an extra 90 minutes today because of high winds in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>. The earliest new landing time for the secret military mission was 4:31 p.m. PST, one orbit later than planned. The winds were not as strong as the 30 mph gusts that forced <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to call off a landing attempt on Sunday. But they were high enough at nearly 20 mph to make landing conditions unacceptable at all three shuttle landing runways. <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> commentator <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Deason </PERSON> said forecasters expected conditions to be acceptable at runway 17, on <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>, at the new tentative landing time. The five astronauts reportedly deployed a spy satellite during their mission. Sunday's postponement marked the sixth time in 32 shuttle flights that a landing has been delayed by weather. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> initially rescheduled the landing for 4:32 p.m. PST today, but <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> decided to bring the shuttle back at 2:52 p.m. PST to reduce sun glare. About an hour before landing, the crew was to ignite the shuttle's re-entry rockets for the fiery dive through the atmosphere. `` The change to the earlier landing opportunity takes advantage of higher sun angle, thereby reducing sun glare on Discovery's windows during landing,'' <PERSON> Deason </PERSON> said Sunday night, about 1 -LCB- hours after <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> announced the landing delay <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said today that the forecast was acceptable for this afternoon, with a clear sky and 12 mph wind, gusting to 17 mph. Mission rules dictate that a shuttle not land during the day if a crosswind exceeds 17 mph, or 12 mph for night landings. The delay does not pose a threat to the astronauts because Discovery carries enough fuel and other supplies to remain in orbit at least through Tuesday. Discovery's commander is <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>.

In announcing the delay, <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> also said the astronauts `` continued to be in excellent condition.'' But a military-imposed news blackout that has shrouded most of the mission kept space agency officials from discussing the crew's reaction to the delay If bad weather persisted at <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION>, other available landing sites included <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> prefers <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> because of the long, wide-open runways. Discovery's flight began Wednesday with a dazzling nighttime liftoff at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>. It was the third shuttle launch after dark, and Sunday's landing was to have been only the third at night. The after-dark blastoff was dictated by the shuttle's cargo and its mission. Sources close to the project have said that the astronauts achieved their main goal Thursday when they released the 2 -LCB- - ton, $ 300 million satellite to eavesdrop on communications in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> The astronauts also reportedly conducted experiments connected with the `` Star Wars'' missile defense system. It was believed the astronauts also conducted research into how people can serve as military observers in space. As Discovery headed home, the space shuttle <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> was being prepared for a 10-day Christmas mission to deploy a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> communications satellite and retrieve a scientific payload that has been orbiting the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> for nearly six years. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> is scheduled to be moved to the launch pad at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> on Tuesday.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration threatened Monday to suspend all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial support for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> if the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> recognizes <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> as a country. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said there was no such nation and it did not meet the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> criteria for membership. It was not immediately clear whether the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> threat would thwart the drive planned by a number of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries later in the week in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not have veto power in the assembly. But its support for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is essential to functioning of the world body. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assessment for 1988 was $ 216 million, of which $ 65 million was paid in October. `` Any action to change the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> status will have the most serious adverse consequences for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. The Assembly on Wednesday is due to begin a debate on the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict, with particular attention to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The territories were lost by <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> war. Palestinians in the territories have been demonstrating against Israeli control for nearly two years. All the Arab governments, meanwhile, recognize the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as the only legitimate representative of the Palestinians. Earlier this year, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which is a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency, and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which is affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, considered giving the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> membership. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> threatened in May to suspend <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to any world organization that recognized <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> as a state. Both groups deferred further action. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has observer status at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The move planned within the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> would give it observer status as a nation, rather than as an organization. In a parallel drive, several <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments were trying within the Food and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to channel assistance to Palestinians on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> through the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Also, they would give the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> national recgonition within the Food and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, in behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, denounced that drive as well. `` We strongly support humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian peopple,'' she said. But, the official added: `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> should not be a conduit for international assistance to the Palestinians. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to believe that raising this type of political issue in a meeting of a technical <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> body is wholly inappropriate. It does nothing to contribute to the settlement of the political issue involved, and does substantial harm to the <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION>'s credibility as an organization worthy of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. support.'' `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opposes any enhancement in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> of the status of the self-proclaimed state of Palestine,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. Reading from a prepared statement, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> does not satisfy the criteria for statehood or meeting the membership requirements of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. She said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had sent messages to several countries outlining the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position and was making its views known `` at the highest levels'' of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Asked if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support would be withdrawn if the Assembly went ahead, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said: `` We feel so strongly about this we would cut off funds.''

<TEXT>
 A project to feed bald eagles with deer killed on the highways is failing because the eagles are too finicky, federal officials say. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has been collecting mule deer carcasses along highways, especially those close to the foothills west of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, and bringing them to the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arsenal </ORGANIZATION> as eagle food. But the bald eagles apparently are uninterested in the deer, officials said, leaving the agency swamped with dead deer. `` We've got a third of a refrigerated semitrailer filled up, and we're still averaging four deer a day from across the area,'' said wildlife service biologist <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockhart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lockhart </PERSON> said the pilot project may have to be suspended. If so, the business of disposing of road kills would fall back to county crews, which typically dump the animals at landfills. The state wildlife division reports about 1,000 deer killed annually on roads throughout the Front Range. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> biologist <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Gober </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION> said Monday the project began in early November, when eagles arrive to winter at the arsenal. It probably will continue as long as the eagles stay, March, he said.

<TEXT>
 Prosecutors proposed $ 100 fines Monday as the total penalty for three state social workers accused of failing to report suspected abuse before a toddler's death during toilet training, attorneys said. `` This gives the appearance the state wants to give this case away,'' said <PERSON> Nat </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, attorney for defendant <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> DuBoise </PERSON>. `` I almost fell out of my chair when they made the offer.'' Two-year-old <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> died July 28 after being repeatedly dunked head-first into a toilet and pounded with pillows because he soiled his diaper, prosecutors say. His mother and stepfather, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Coe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION>, have been charged with first-degree murder, and the social workers were accused of failing to act on earlier complaints the couple had abused their son. Prosecutors offered the plea bargain Monday only to state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> program administrator <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Houk </PERSON>, supervisor <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and caseworker Ms. <PERSON> DuBoise </PERSON>, who were charged with the second-degree misdemeanor Aug. 31 amid controversy over the boy's death. The misdemeanor charge carried a maximum penalty of 60 days in jail. Another HRS caseworker, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, was charged with aggravated child abuse in addition to the misdemeanor charge. No plea offer was made to her, the attorneys said. As a result of the case, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month allocated $ 39 million to pay for more caseworkers to prevent child abuse. `` We make plea offers in cases every day. The fact that this is a high-profile case makes no difference to me,'' said Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguero </PERSON>, who refused to comment on the details of the plea bargain. Any offer would have to be approved at a pre-trial hearing Dec. 28, <PERSON> Aguero </PERSON> said. Both White and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, the attorney for <PERSON> Houk </PERSON>, said they would advise their clients to take the deal only if it involves a no-contest plea in which they do not have to admit guilt. Ms. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, was not immediately available for comment; he was out of his office visiting clients `` Even if it's a small fine, nobody wants this on their record,'' <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> said. `` I think $ 100 is fair,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` My feeling was that even if they were found guilty, the judge would not be able to impose a stiff sentence anyway.'' <PERSON> Houk </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> were temporarily suspended but have returned to work. Ms. <PERSON> DuBoise </PERSON> quit her job Aug. 3.

<HEAD>Talk of the Town: Is the Class System Dead?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The class system, that mysterious code the British like to believe is uniquely their own, has suffered a double blow in recent days. First comes a survey saying that Britons, for all their fascination with accents, dress and good form, are no more class-conscious than any other nation. No sooner has that shocking revelation been digested than a schools association brandishes statistics to show that the old school tie no longer binds. Only the other day Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was telling Parliament: `` The old class-based order is being replaced by one based on merit, ability and effort. This is the new <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ the <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for the 1990s.'' Appropriately enough, the grocer's daughter who leads the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> made her remarks during the first House of Commons session to be televised. Television, like income tax and traffic jams, is one of the great levelers of class in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` British Social Attitudes,'' a survey published this month by <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, an independent research institute, finds that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is fairly average by most social indicators. After studying data from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, the study concludes: `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> does not emerge as an especially class-conscious or class-bound society. Such differences as there are have been talked up, as much by British observers as by anyone else.'' Meanwhile, a survey for the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> points to massive changes in the makeup of the so-called public schools, the private institutions from <LOCATION> Eton </LOCATION> downward that have long been regarded as bastions of the upper classes. The survey reports that only six percent of public school kids attend the same schools as their parents, and that 41 percent have parents who were n't educated in public schools. `` The myth of the old school tie has been finally nailed,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodhead </PERSON>, national director of the service. `` The picture that emerges is of a highly critical body of parents, unfettered by traditional loyalties or by prejudice.'' And yet debate rages on as to whether <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is a class-bound nation. The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> calls it `` The Great British Obsession,'' while another newspaper, Today, devotes two pages to demonstrate that the old class divisions that were based on money and family lineage are being replaced by snobbery, a game anyone can play. In January, the newspaper The Independent commissioned opinions from writer <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Eton </ORGANIZATION> headmaster <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> said that `` despite appearances to the contrary, social class still holds this country in its grip,'' while <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> argued the opposite. He wrote that class barriers were crumbling, and pointed to studies showing that by the year 2000, 70 percent of all job will require brains, not brawn, compared with only 30 percent in 1945. `` If the class system is a divisive force, it is not a very effective one,'' he wrote. And even if some parents still chose <LOCATION> Eton </LOCATION> just for the social cachet, `` we take the boy anyway in the confidence that we can teach him better values.'' The Duke of <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION> does n't believe that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, even after 10 years in power, can break down all the conventions built up over the centuries. `` The class barriers have been broken down to a huge extent, although certain conventions are adhered to,'' he said in an interview. Accent is still a great pigeonholer, but nobody watching BBC-TV news can help being struck by the gallimaufry of regional accents that predominate among its reporters, from chainsaw Ulster through <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> burr to <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> twang. The plummy <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> voices of 30 years ago would be laughed out of the studio.

<TEXT>
 A lack of state funding is delaying court-ordered freedom for a retarded man who has been confined for 31 years at a state hospital, attorneys said Monday. <PERSON> Bernt </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a 51-year-old who has the mental capability of an 8-year-old, has a full-time job and is ready to move from a group home on the hospital grounds to a private community group home, according to <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> of the Legal Center for the Handicapped. However, she said, the state Division of Handicapped Services must approve a contract for <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s care at the home at an estimated annual cost of $ 60,000. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> was declared psychotic and committed to the state hospital in 1957 after he was ruled incompetent to stand trial on rape and murder charges. Doctors at the hospital said in 1972 that he had been cured of his insanity; however, the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in June 1988 that <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> was retarded, not insane, and must be allowed to return to the community. A 12-member committee assembled by District Judge <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> to coordinate <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s rehabilitation believes he is now ready to leave the hospital, <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> said. `` He has exceeded everyone's expectations,'' she said. She told the judge she had hoped to see <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> leave the hospital by Thursday. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> is working as a dishwasher and helper at a local cafe, earning the minimum wage, she said. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> said he would accept the committee's plan, but not before Handicapped Services explained the delay. He set a hearing for Jan. 22 to review the case. Last February, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> was permitted to move into the group home on the hospital grounds and take the job, as long as he wore an electronic ankle bracelet while outside the hospital. Three months ago, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> allowed him to remove the bracelet.

 Up to 48,000 people were buried in graves that were already occupied at two cemeteries in a practice dating to the 1920s, according to investigators for the state attorney general's office. Three former officials of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crematories </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the city's oldest cemetery company, are to stand trial in February on charges resulting from the investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> cemeteries. `` It may be beyond the abilities of most people to comprehend just what has gone on out here,'' <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> archaeologist <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBlasi </PERSON>, said in a recent interview. Some graves contained the remains of as many as six people, and graves containing the remains of three or four are common, said <PERSON> DiBlasi </PERSON>, whose team examined about 100 graves at the two cemeteries in eastern <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. Remains from previous burials were found so often in a section of Eastern Cemetery called Babyland that about 70 infants' bodies were buried only 10 to 18 inches deep, employees have told investigators. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, an investigator for the state attorney general's office, reported finding human bones throughout Eastern Cemetery: in a truck's glove compartment, a tool box, a storage shed, dirt piles and even a fast-food hamburger bag <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> said he found ashes from 244 cremated bodies, many of them unidentified, in a cabinet and on shelves in the celler of the crematory at Eastern. <PERSON> DiBlasi </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> also uncovered several buried headstones. Although there are some unmarked graves at the cemeteries, thousands have headstones. In July, a <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury indicted three officials on 60 counts, including reuse of graves and abuse of corpses. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crematories </ORGANIZATION> and Cemetery since May 1986; <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, board president and acting executive director from 1980 to 1986; and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Copley </PERSON>, board vice president and a company employee since 1987 face 188 to 268 years in prison and fines of up to $ 4,000 if convicted. The company could be fined up to $ 1.12 million. The three men resigned from the company. <PERSON> DiBlasi </PERSON> said he had determined that the practice of reusing graves had been going on long before the three joined the company. `` This is n't something that started with these folks back in the'70s,'' as was first suspected, he said. <PERSON> DiBlasi </PERSON> said his team's excavations indicated that graves were being reused as early as the mid-1920s at Eastern. Cemetery records indicate it was probably full shortly after the turn of the century. Eastern, which occupies 15 acres, had enough room for about 18,000 bodies under existing standards, but investigators estimate about 51,000 were buried there, according to <PERSON> DiBlasi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>'s report estimated that about 15,000 too many bodies were buried at <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>. That would put the estimated number of bodies in previously used graves at both cemeteries at 48,000. <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> Crematories and Cemetery, a 141-year-old company which has mostly served <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>'s poor and middle class, also operates Schardein Cemetery. The company came under scrutiny in May when employee <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> called the attorney general's office, <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>'s report said. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a gravedigger and maintenance worker, said graves were reused throughout the eight years he worked for the company. He said that at one point within the past year a skull was dug up and inadvertently left sitting atop a dirt pile during a funeral. The grieving family never saw the skull, `` and we put it back in the hole after they left,'' he said.

 Forty-four states now require school teachers to pass competency tests _ up from just 10 in 1980, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> said Monday in its annual teacher testing survey.

The clearinghouse, which is operated by American Institutes, provides information on educational testing and evaluation. States commonly use two types of tests to assess teacher competency _ certification tests for graduates of teacher education programs and admissions tests for people who apply to teacher education programs before they can be enrolled. Most tests are standardized variety, but a few states use customized tests created exclusively for their own jurisdiction. Thirty-six states now administer teacher certification tests. Twenty-six states require admissions tests and 18 states require teachers to pass both admissions and certification tests. Although some states with testing programs do not collect and report passing rate information, the survey said the passing rates on certification tests range from a low of 69 percent in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> to a high of 97 percent in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. On admissions tests, passing rates range from a low of 58 percent in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> to a high of 95 percent in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Break in Relations Sets Back Central American Peace Process</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prospects for peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, battered by fierce battles this month between Salvadoran rebels and the government, were further set back by <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s break in relations with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> The move Sunday by rightist President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> capped a series of events that indicates more tension, conflict and war lies ahead in the troubled region. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, who suspended relations to protest the alleged shipment of sophisticated arms from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s leftist rebels, called Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> `` a puppet of international communist aggression. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he was glad not to have relations with `` a genocidal government that kills priests.'' He was referring to the Salvadoran air force's strafing and rocketing of populated neighborhoods of the capital in response to a new guerrilla offensive and to the slaying of six Jesuit educators on Nov. 16. A witness has testified the killers of the Jesuits wore army uniforms. Two regional counterparts, President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, expressed their regret at the rupture in relations. `` Now, the process of peace in the region has stagnated,'' <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> told reporters last weekend. He said the break makes his borders with both countries more tense and `` exacerbates even more the region's social and political crisis.'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, the principal author of a 1987 regional accord designed to bring peace to the war-torn isthmus, issued a communique saying he `` laments'' the break in relations because `` it expresses the gravity of the developments of the past days.'' Immediately after announcing the suspension of relations, <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said he would not attend next week's summit of Central American presidents set in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The session is intended as a follow up on the <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> peace plan. The Costa Rican president issued an urgent call Monday for a change of venue. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s reason for balking was the site, a country he contends is aiding the effort to topple his government. In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Geissel </PERSON>, the Salvadoran charge d'affaires, said his country had been planning for several months to upgrade the mission, name him ambassador and increase the staff and office space. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> withdrew its charge d'affaires and other diplomats from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Nov. 18 as a `` precautionary measure.'' <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> recalled its ambassador after the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> came to power in a 1978-79 revolution and the Salvadoran Embassy was fired upon, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Geissel </PERSON> said. Since then, the mission has been headed by a series of six charges d'affaires, he said. The schism came only days after developments that complicated matters on the region's other war front, between the Sandinista army and U.S.-backed Contra rebels. Negotiations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> between the two sides broke down last week. On Saturday, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> responded bitterly to Honduran expressions of concern about Sandinista army concentrations near <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` These Hondurans are crazy,'' said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. `` We'll put our troops wherever the hell we want to as long as they're in our own country.'' He said the Honduran army `` should pull on its pants and kick out the Contras, who are threatening the territorial integrity of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.'' About 10,000 anti-Sandinista rebels have been camped for nearly two years in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> near the Nicaraguan border. Some reportedly have been filtering back in to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, where combat has intensified in recent weeks. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> last month ended a truce with the Contras. `` <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has an army that is very valiant when it comes to killing its own people, but not valiant enough to kick out the Contras,'' said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, using some of the region's most incendiary language in months. A Salvadoran politician who has been a top-ranking diplomat said the apparent victory of <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON>, a conservative, in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' presidential election Sunday further clouds a complicated regional scene. `` There is great fear that a far-rightist axis will form between <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and that the demobilization of the Contras will not be brought off,'' said the diplomat, commenting on condition of anonymity. He said the Honduran armed forces were particularly worried about a victory by <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON>, who they view as less insistent on demobilization and expulsion of the anti-Sandinista force.

 Democrat <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> was declared elected governor Monday, but <PERSON> Republican </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> asked for a recount and an investigation of alleged irregularities in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s closest gubernatorial election. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s announcement came about three hours before the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> received 897,139 votes to 890,285 for <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> out of nearly 1.8 million cast, for a margin of 6,854 votes, or .38 percent. Unofficial results had shown <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, the nation's first elected black governor, ahead by 6,852 votes. State law allows for a taxpayer-funded recount if the margin is less than half a percent. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, a former state attorney general, said he would seek a recount and ask the Democrat-controlled <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to investigate alleged election irregularities in the Nov. 7 balloting. In a notice to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> leaders stating he intends to contest the result, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said voter registration lists used in the election contained the names of people ineligible to vote. `` In an election as close as this one, irregularities which would not ordinarily have a probable impact on the outcome assume a greater importance,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said in an accompanying letter. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, declined to give details of the allegations. `` There are a number of areas that we're looking into,'' he said. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> had until Dec. 7 to request a recount but Monday was the deadline for contesting the election because of alleged irregularities. He said he would withdraw the challenge if the recount and other information convinces him that the proceeding is `` no longer necessary to safeguard the accuracy and integrity'' of the election. Democrats have no problem with <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s request for a recount, but his contesting the election is `` a very cynical approach to politics,'' said <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Democratic Chairman Lawrence H. Framme III. `` The entire electoral process was marked by a high degree of integrity,'' Framme said. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, the state's lieutenant governor, said he would proceed with plans for his administration that began just after he claimed victory election night. He will be inaugurated Jan. 13. The recount will be overseen by a panel of three judges headed by the chief judge of the <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. If <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> proceeds with contesting the election after the recount, the matter would go before the privileges and elections committees of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said state Sen. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, president pro tempore of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who once won a contested election for his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, said the proceeding would resemble a trial with both sides presenting witnesses and evidence to the legislators.

<HEAD>Council of State Rules Islamic Scarves May be Worn in School</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Council of State ruled Monday that Moslem girls may wear Islamic scarves to school if it does not cause disruptions, but the decision seemed unlikely to end the controversy. The ruling by the council, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s highest administrative authority, leaves it up to school authorities to judge on a case-by-case basis whether the wearing of the `` hijab'' scarf constitutes `` an act of pressure or provocation, of proselytism or propaganda.'' Education Minister <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jospin </PERSON> had sought the ruling after weeks of heated arguments. Wearing the hijab, which covers the hair, ears and neck, is not incompatible `` with the principle of secularity in so far as it constitutes the exercise of the freedom of expression'' and religious belief, the council said. The principle of secularity in public schools has been the law in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> since the Roman Catholic church was officially separated from the state in 1905. The latest controversy arose seven weeks ago when three Moslem teen-agers in <LOCATION> Creil </LOCATION>, a town north of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, refused to remove their scarves. The school principal, <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Chenieres </PERSON>, applied a 1937 law prohibiting all religious symbols from school and denied the three girls the right to attend class until they removed the scarves. The girls refused and the issue became the center of a national debate. Similar cases arose in <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Avignon </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Montpellier </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Poissy </LOCATION> and the arguments became linked to the issue of immigration, particularly attitudes toward immigrants from Moslem countries of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` The Council of State has noted there can be no general and absolute prohibition of the scarf,'' <PERSON> Jospin </PERSON> told reporters after the ruling by the 90-member Council. He said he would circulate new guidelines to schools. `` It is a debate that touches on freedoms so it should not be regulated in a rigid way from on high,'' he said. Both conservatives and communists criticized the ruling. <PERSON> Saida </PERSON> <PERSON> Chella </PERSON>, a 17-year-old high school student in <LOCATION> Avignon </LOCATION> who left school in October because the principal refused to allow her to attend classes wearing a hijab, said: `` Starting tomorrow morning, I will go to school ... with my scarf. The principal ca n't refuse me that. <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Juppe </PERSON>, secretary-general of the conservative Rally for the Republic opposition party, said the socialist government lacked the courage to pass a new law clarifying the matter and was dumping the problem back on the schools. `` If the law is not clear enough, it -LRB- the government -RRB- must present <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> with legislation that would clarify the situation,'' he said. <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoinie </PERSON>, head of the communist group in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said the government was `` backing away from the principle of secularity.'' <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Megret </PERSON>, No. 2 man in the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> that has campaigned for years on an anti-immigration platform, said: `` The question being posed is not that of neutrality of schools, but that of the colonization of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s largest teachers' union, said the council's ruling was `` a return to square one. It said the ruling interpreted existing law, but teachers were seeking precise regulations that would `` guarantee the secularity of public service education.''

<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> task force Monday called for streamlining death-penalty appeals, but said even its proposed changes would allow a convicted killer to fend off execution for six years. The task force's lengthy report offered generally less severe reforms than those proposed by a committee appointed by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> earlier this year. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> task force recommendations would require states to pay for qualified lawyers to represent death row inmates for all their appeals. Civil liberties lawyers had denounced the Rehnquist-appointed committee, led by retired <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, for failing to assure the competence of such lawyers. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> task force report said assuring qualified lawyers not only `` assures fairness, but also avoids unnecessary delays in the process.'' The report recommends imposing a one-year deadline for someone whose murder coviction has been upheld on direct appeal in state courts to seek federal court help. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>'s committee has recommended a six-month deadline. No such deadline exists now, and the average time between someone being sentenced to death and actual execution is over eight years. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> task force report has been sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where it joins the <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> committee report. The task force report will be presented to the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making House of Delegates at its February meeting. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klain </PERSON>, chief counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> as saying he expects the task force report to be `` a very, very seriously considered document.'' The committee's chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., already has proposed legislation that adopts some of the <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> committee's There are more than 2,200 convicted murderers on death rows across the nation, but only 119 executions have occurred since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reinstated capital punishment in 1976. The task force said its year-long study was aimed at shortening the total time for reviewing death-penalty cases, but noted that `` some reasonable amount of time is still indispensable for a thorough consideration of the issues.'' `` We should no longer see the aberrant case that is still in litigation after nine or 10 years,'' the report said, -LRB- but -RRB- it would be unrealistic to expect the ... review process will take less than approximately six years'' if all available appeals are pursued.

 Intensified searching for the five crew members of a lobster boat netted nothing Monday despite reports of three flare sightings in 12 hours, officials said. At sea, 200 miles off <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard, five jets and two cutters spent the day zeroing in on the 25-square-mile area of rotary current where the flares had been pinpointed. Hope remained that the crew of the 72-foot <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> may be alive and floating in relatively friendly Gulf Stream water. The steel-hulled lobster boat out of <LOCATION> Stonington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and its crew _ <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON>, 33; and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>, all in their 20s _ has been missing officially since Wednesday. But officers at the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s command post began tracking distress signals for a week. On Friday, the day after a Thanksgiving Day storm raged through the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, rescuers turned up a floating radio beacon and fishing markers bearing the <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>'s name. Hopes dimmed over the weekend as searchers scoured tens of thousands of miles under good conditions. `` We'd been looking for something the size of a <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> in an area the size of the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' Lt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. `` We were getting to the point where we'd exhausted any chance of finding anything on the surface of the ocean.'' Then overnight Sunday and into Monday morning white flares were sighted on three occasions, galvanizing searchers. Several fishermen at the docks on <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> shores refused to talk about their friends. The dockmaster said only: `` Everyone here is on edge, the families and the fishermen.'' `` Safety is always on your mind,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cale </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Stonington </LOCATION> native who has recently gone back to lobstering. `` I've lost cousins, a lot of people around here have lost relatives to the sea.

<TEXT>
 The Communist leaders of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, who were late and reluctant themselves in embracing change, said Monday the Czechoslovak party is paying `` the bitter price'' of resisting reform. Pressure for more rapid change at home continued. In <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, a center of the reform movement, 200,000 activists marched and a rally speaker demanded a referendum on German reunification. Some demonstrators carried placards for <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> unity and the issue dominated the weekly <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> rally for the second Monday in a row. The East German leadership resists reunification, but has mentioned as an alternative a vaguely phrased idea of confederation with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Officials in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, the West German capital, said Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> had a plan that called for several intermediate steps leading to reunification. They said he would present it to Parliament on Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> planned to discuss the formula with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by telephone. Government spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> might go to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for a summit Dec. 19, but would not decide until the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> congress scheduled to end two days earlier. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION>, a mass-circulation newspaper in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Berghofer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> gave a gloomy assessment of prospects for the East German party. `` The people have already taken our power away,'' <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. `` The leading role of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is already history.'' <PERSON> Berghofer </PERSON> has been mentioned as a possible challenger to party chief <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, who will seek re-election at the December congress. Communist leaders criticized the 2.3 million-member Freie Deutsche Jugend youth group for leaving the party, but reserved their harshest comments for hard-liners in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. `` Undoubtedly, a storm is raging on the Vltava,'' the party newspaper <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitung </PERSON> said, referring to the river that runs through the city. `` It is bringing the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> the bitter price for the grave errors of the past.'' It criticized the hard-liners for clinging to `` the heresy that amid the radical reforms in economics, in the political sphere, everything could stay as it was.'' The paper cited `` the illusory, risky business of trying to choke the call for democracy with police clubs ten days ago.'' Freie Deutsche Jugend, the traditional stepping stone to success for <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and other members of the leadership, announced Friday it no longer wanted to be the `` helper and fighting reserve'' of the party. The front-page editorial was the harshest East German criticism of its <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> ally to to date. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> stopped police repression of public protest in early October, and reform ideas have gained momentum since. <PERSON> Berghofer </PERSON>, 46, is not a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> or ruling Politburo, but has become prominent among reform-minded Communists because of the way he handled unrest last month in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>. He was quoted as telling Bild only `` two or three well known names, or perhaps none'' will remain in the leadership after the party congress and `` the Communists will become only one party among many.'' For 40 years, the Communists have claimed to get more than 99 percent of the votes in elections. <PERSON> Berghofer </PERSON> predicted the true count in free elections would be less than 20 percent. Elections have been promised for late next year or early 1991. Democratic Awakening, an opposition group, said Monday it would establish itself formally as a political party at a convention Dec. 16-17 in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>. The party congress is schedled for Dec. 15-17 in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Democratic Awakening has about 10,000 members and is considered more conservative than the largest opposition group, New Forum, to which more than 200,000 people belong.

 <PERSON> Gunnar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedlund </PERSON>, long-time leader of the Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and former interior minister, has died at age 89. <PERSON> Hedlund </PERSON> died Sunday after a long illness. The cause of death was not given but both the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Aftonbladet </ORGANIZATION> and news agency <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> said it probably was heart failure. <PERSON> Hedlund </PERSON> was known for his quick wit, voiced in a heavy northern accent. He entered parliament in 1942 representing the Farmer's <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and became party leader in 1949.

<TEXT>
 Mutineers led by a former army commander attacked the presidential palace in the <LOCATION> Comoro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and killed President <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON>, longtime ruler of the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island nation, officials said Monday. The rebel leader, former commandant <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON>, resigned recently in a dispute with the 70-year-old president, an official at the <ORGANIZATION> Comoro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the Sunday night assassination was not a coup and that <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> was under arrest. The number of attackers was not divulged and the official said he did not know if anyone else was seized. <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> was killed in a firefight between rebel soldiers of the regular army and his 300-man presidential guard, state <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comoro </ORGANIZATION> said. It said a guard officer also was killed. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Djohar </PERSON>, took over as leader of an interim government as dictated by the constitution, the official said. The government declared a 40-day period of mourning. <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> had survived coup attempts in 1983, 1985 and 1987. His government denied reports of a coup attempt in 1981. The Sunday attack took place in the capital of <LOCATION> Moroni </LOCATION>, on the main island of Grand Camore, home to half the nation's predominantly Moslem population of 500,000 The Comoros, which lie between <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, were governed by <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> for all but three years since 1972. The former French colony is among the world's poorest and least developed nations, with an estimated annual per capita income of $ 339. About 60 percent of the population is younger than 20. <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> will be buried Tuesday on his native island of <LOCATION> Anjouan </LOCATION>, said Radio Comoro, monitored on the French-administered island of <PERSON> Mayotte </PERSON>. The fighting apparently did not spill into the streets. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, manager of the Galewa Sun hotel, told the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> by telephone everything was normal _ `` The town is very quiet.'' Three weeks ago, <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> won a referendum allowing him to seek a third six-year term when his term expires next year. Official results showed the measure passed with 92.5 percent of the vote. The five opposition parties complained of voting irregularities and opposition leaders in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> jailed critics shortly after the balloting. <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON>, a Moslem was first elected president in 1972, when the archipelago was still a French possession. The Comoros unilaterally declared independence in July 1975 and <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> became head of state. He was overthrown a month later by <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Soilih </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> had amassed personal power in a dictatorial style, but returned to power in 1978 in another coup led by French mercenary <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Denard </PERSON>. <PERSON> Denard </PERSON>, now 60, created the black-shirted presidential guard and staffed it with European soldiers of fortune. He became a special adviser to <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON>, converted to Islam and settled in the islands. It was not known Monday whether he played any role in the latest episode. The presidential guard was better equipped and trained than the 700-man regular army and many Comorans came to see it as a device to keep <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> in power. <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> resisted calls to reform his regime and accused <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the former colonial power, of fomenting rebellion against him. He had long been irked by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s refusal to cede control of <PERSON> Mayotte </PERSON> to his government. The island decided in a 1975 referendum to remain French. President F.W. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> sent a message of condolence Monday addressed to the `` acting head of government'' condemning the assassination. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is a major foreign investor in the republic. The three islands of Grand Comore, <LOCATION> Anjouan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moheli </LOCATION> cover 718 square miles. The republic's main income is from tourism and the export of perfume, copra, coconuts, cloves, vanilla and cinnamon.

<TEXT>
 Opposition groups narrowly won a referendum Monday that postpones the presidential election and gives them more time to organize against the ruling Communists, who now call themselves the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. According to preliminary results from the national electoral board, 50.1 percent of those participating voted for the first question on the ballot: `` Should the presidential elections be held only after the parliamentary elections?'' It was <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s first free election in more than four decades, and the first since the Communists dissolved their party, renamed it the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and opened the way for free, multiparty politics. A statement from the board said the four opposition groups sponsoring the referendum won by only 6,618 votes. Official final results were to be announced Tuesday. Of the 4,297,454 valid votes cast in the first referendum in postwar <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, 2,152,036 favored the question and 2,145,418 were opposed. Hours earlier, <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate, acknowledged the opposition had won. The other three questions on the ballot were approved overwhelmingly, said the electoral board statement carried by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>. It said 95.1 percent of voters wanted the party out of the workplace, 95.4 percent said the ruling party should reveal its assets, and 94.9 percent favored disbanding the Workers' Militia, a party army that already is melting away. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> told a news conference earlier Monday: `` While in Eastern and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> people by the hundreds of thousands are marching in the streets to express their opinion, Hungarians are going to the ballot box to express their political will.'' Victory for the opposition means new democratic <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, to be chosen by June, will elect the president. If voters had defeated the referendum, they would have elected a president directly on Jan. 7. Opposition groups said an election in January left them too little time to organize a serious challenge to <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>. They hope to win strong representation in the new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which would give their candidate a better chance at the presidency. Recent opinion polls indicate the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will not win a majority of the seats. Pal <PERSON> Kara </PERSON>, secretary of the referendum committee in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said 58.2 percent of the 7.8 million eligible voters cast ballots. The opposition alliance has proposed that <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> amend the constitution to allow a popular election of the president after the new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is elected. It also proposed curtailing the president's powers. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Petoe </PERSON>, a leader of the Free Democrats, said the president should not have the power to dissolve <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Under the current constitution, the president also is commander of the armed forces and can call elections. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, asked about the opposition proposal to hold direct elections after the new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is elected, said he was `` happy'' about it. He said he had no wish to be `` a fully weakened presidential figurehead. ... That is different from my perception.'' <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> added, however, that he did not believe the head of state should have `` arbitrary power.'' If <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> chooses the president, <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> said, his chances of getting the job will diminish `` because, in that case, the position is subject to political bargaining.''

 A wintry storm marching across the continent hit the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> with up to 18 inches of snow Monday, and high wind, poor visibility and icy roads combined to close schools. By afternoon, snow fell over much of the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> region and the upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, while rain extended from eastern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> into the upper Great Lakes region and northern sections of the lower <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>.

 Eight people were injured in clashes between two ethnic groups in the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> during the past two days, a local journalist reported Monday. An editor of the Georgian news agency <PERSON> Gruzinform </PERSON>, who refused to identify himself, said ethnic Georgians and <PERSON> Ossetins </PERSON> fought near <LOCATION> Tskhinvali </LOCATION>, about 60 miles northwest of the capital <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>. Local police blocked roads to <LOCATION> Tskhinvali </LOCATION> and the city itself was quiet, he said. He said informal Georgian groups planned to meet in <LOCATION> Tskhinvali </LOCATION> last Saturday, but loaded buses and trucks blocked their way and no meeting took place. The ethnic clashes broke out later, the editor said, adding that the agency had no details on the planned rally or on the cause of the clashes. The Ossetians are one of the many small ethnic groups populating the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republic that has been a trouble spot this year. Clashes between the Georgians and Abkhazians have been especially violent, but the Ossetians and the Meskhetian region also felt tensions.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health official called Monday for federal regulation of all cholesterol screenings not conducted by health care professionals, saying booths in shopping malls and other public settings can be inaccurate and spread infections such as AIDS and hepatitis. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON>, inspector general at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said testers at these screenings frequently disregard basic rules of hygiene in collecting blood samples and often are poorly trained to operate the cholesterol-measuring devices. `` I do not think it is conducive to good medical benefit to have in this carnival-like atmosphere untrained people engaging in a procedure which has some risk to public health from infection,'' he told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. He added that people who are tested `` are going to try to depend on these results, and the results, in fact, are not very accurate.'' <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> said he is concerned that public cholesterol screenings are growing in popularity and that they are often used by entrepreneurs as a marketing strategy to promote products or by stores to increase traffic. The inspector general said in an interview that his office is conducting a criminal investigation into `` several scams'' in which screeners unnecessarily refer Medicare and Medicaid recipients to physicians for follow-up tests. Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on regulation and business opportunities, said the scams involved screeners' rigging cholesterol-measuring devices so they showed higher than true levels Both declined to discuss the investigation further. The investigation grew out of a study conducted by the inspector general's office at the request of <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> as part of his panel's continuing inquiry into unregulated medical testing <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON>'s report, released at Monday's hearing, said demand for screening is growing because of greater public awareness of the link between high cholesterol and heart disease. <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> said he could not estimate accurately the number of screenings that are conducted yearly at shopping malls, pharmacies, health clubs, village halls and a variety of other public settings. But he called it a `` growth industry'' and said at least 10 million people were tested this way in 1988. The inspector general's investigators, who participated in 71 screenings as part of the study, often had a variety of health concerns, including testers who collected blood, usually by a finger prick, and also handled money but wore no gloves and did not disinfect between collections, he said. <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> said these conditions raise the risk, both for testers and those being tested, of infection from blood-borne diseases, including AIDS and hepatitis. `` The likelihood is not that great,'' he said, adding that he knew of no case in which disease has been spread through contact at screenings. `` But I do n't know if you want to be the 50th in line that day'' when proper hygiene is not being followed, he said. `` You're just asking for trouble.'' According to their findings, guidelines issued by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cholesterol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium of organizations coordinated by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION>, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, were usually not followed, he said. Often screenings held in crowded shopping centers or stores were frenzied and 42 percent of them were staffed by just one person. Investigatores found that testers had little training and often no medical background, he said. The portable analyzers used at screenings are accurate when used properly, he added, but if not calibrated or operated correctly, they often yield innacurate results. Also, nearly 60 percent of the investigators whose blood was drawn with a finger prick had their fingers squeezed or `` milked,'' which can dilute the sample with material from between the cells and give a lower than true result. Dr. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Luepker </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> testified that a study he conducted last year at several <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> screenings found inaccurate results as high as 27 percent of the time at one site. Most often, he said, the inaccurate result was lower than the true level. <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said his concern was that people `` can be lulled into a false sense of security. They may not see their doctors; they may not change their diets, and they may not exercise. Over time, not knowing that they're in the danger zone could cost us our health and even our lives.'' <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON>'s study did not measure the accuracy of testings, but one of his investigators, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Butz </PERSON>, who directed the project, said she was tested five times, with the results ranging from 195 to 243 milligrams per deciliter. A reading of 200 is considered to be the desirable level, 200-239 borderline high blood cholesterol and over 240 a high level. Currently, no federal regulations govern public cholesterol screenings and state regulation is scattered and varied. <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> said 16 states have laws on their books, but that regulations in four of them have not been implemented. A 1988 federal law brings all clinical laboratories under federal regulation on Jan. 1, 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is drafting regulations to implement the law. The law, however, provides that some medical testing may be exempt from its provisions. The inspector general recommended that public screenings be included in the regulations because `` federal regulation ... is clearly called for in order to safeguard the public.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The editors of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s national newspapers said Monday that in an attempt to ward off regulatory legislation, they have agreed to a code of press behavior. Pressure has been building to rein in the more sensational tabloids as concerns have risen about the invasion of privacy. In a joint declaration, the editors said they realized newspapers needed to improve self-regulation. The code, to be published in each paper, calls for an appointed ombudsman to police press behavior and safeguard standards of accuracy and fairness. `` They will have the power to question journalists and editorial executives. They will have the right to require prompt publication of statements of correction and to have their findings published,'' the code said. It sets out rules requiring a justifiable public interest if private lives are intruded upon, and a fair opportunity for reply. Mistakes must be corrected promptly and with appropriate prominence. Newspapers will be barred from paying criminals for their stories. The purchase of stories from figures in the news is common in British journalism. The editors said they hope the declaration will stop moves in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to curb invasion of privacy. Editors said they believe legislation could hamper access for journalists. On Nov. 20, publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> fired <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, the editor of his tabloid The People, for publishing photographs of Princes <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and of entertainer <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> that he found not acceptable.

<TEXT>
 A Colombian jetliner crashed on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> shortly after takeoff Monday and all 107 people aboard were killed. A caller to a radio station claimed drug traffickers bombed the jet. Witnesses said the <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727-100 exploded before it plunged into a hilly area south of the capital, about a mile from a neighborhood of slum houses and factories. Pieces of the jet were found up to six miles from the main point of impact, police said. Hours later, a man called <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> and claimed that a group called The Extraditables blew up the jet to kill five police informants. He said the five gave police information that led to the discovery of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel leader's hideout. The man did not identify himself, and the claim could not be immediately authenticated. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> said one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen, <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Escabi </PERSON>, was known to have been killed in the crash. He said <PERSON> Escabi </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, also held Colombian citizenship and lived in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. `` The plane was flying along when suddenly it exploded, broke in two and fell in flames and smoke,'' said a witness, <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, in an interview with the radio network <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. Flight 203 was bound for <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, about 190 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. Cali is the headquarters of one of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s biggest cocaine cartels and has been the site of frequent bombings and other attacks since the government declared war on drug lords in August. `` I heard explosions and I thought there was some problem with transformers in the electrical station, but I looked up and saw a plane explode in the air, and bodies and pieces of luggage were falling,'' said another witness, <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>. Two Colombian air force pilots in another plane reported seeing two explosions on the jet, said the director of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, Col. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>. The airline refused comment on the reports of explosions. Avianca spokeswoman <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said the plane carried 101 passengers and a crew of six and that all were killed. Their nationalities were not immediately known. No one on the ground was hurt, spokesmen for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> teams said in radio interviews. Investigators found no evidence of a bomb, said Col. <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Leal </PERSON>, chief of national police for the state. Radio <PERSON> Caracol </PERSON> said the flight recorder was found and civil aeronautics specialists were analyzing its data. The plane took off from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> at 7:15 a.m., and the pilot, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ossa </PERSON>, told the tower at 7:18 a.m. that everything was normal, Ms. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. It crashed shortly afterward. The pilot's wife, <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> <PERSON> Ossa </PERSON>, is from <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and lives in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> with the couple's four children. One witness said he saw black smoke pouring from one of the plane's three engines and the plane then blew up. Most of the wreckage was in an area about 200 feet by 50 feet. The biggest piece appeared to be about 50 feet long. <PERSON> Leal </PERSON> said one piece of the jet was found six miles away. The <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> radio network said a body was found a half-mile from the main crash site. Police at the crash site said 120 people had been arrested for looting the bodies, suitcases, packages, and mail. Several of the looters were caught removing rings and gold chains from the corpses, police said. The government of President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> declared war on drug traffickers in August, and since then there have been several bombings and other attacks, but none on a large scale. The Extraditables is a shadowy group linked to the notorious <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel. The group takes its name from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s list of 12 Colombian drug suspects most wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The head of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, tops the list.

 An Islamic fundamentalist group praised the killing of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and urged that more be ambushed in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The call for more attacks was in a leaflet distributed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> by the fundamentalist group <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, or Zeal. It called for a strike Dec. 9, as the third year of the uprising in the occupied lands begins. Also Monday, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said a Palestinian shot and wounded in the neck by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops during a clash in April died of his injuries in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrada </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Shaer </PERSON>, 21, of the town of <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, on the Egyptian border, died Sunday of respiratory complications at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. His death raised to 617 the number of Palestinians killed by Israelis in the uprising. Forty-two Israelis have died, including nine soldiers. At least 151 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs since the rebellion began in December 1987, most on suspicion of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or for prostitution or drug dealing. The latest death came Monday, when a Palestinian man identified as <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Saoud </PERSON>, 22, died of wounds suffered five days earlier when he was attacked by masked Palestinians armed with axes in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. They said he was accused of attempting to blackmail <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> women with photographs and videotapes. A leaflet distributed Monday in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> by the PLO-backed Unified Leadership of the Uprising urged an end to the internecine killings and ordered groups operating outside the leadership's direction to stop their activities. The leaflet called for `` stopping the campaign to kill those who went astray'' and said all means must be used to convince people cooperating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to change their ways. The appeal followed weekend reports that groups of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists with assault rifles had begun patrols in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> to search for suspected collaborators. <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> has been the scene of 23 of the collaborator killings, and most have been blamed on gangs operating outside the leadership's control. In the <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> leaflet, the group said it had mobilized `` several thousand strugglers'' to step up the uprising. It praised the shooting deaths of two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in mid-November and the deaths of two others earlier this year and called for `` the increased use of ambushes against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in the third year of the uprising.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> has been outlawed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and more than 250 of its leaders have been arrested, according to the army. Some are awaiting trial on charges including involvement in the kidnapping murders of the soldiers and other security offenses. Also Monday: _ <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers rounded up more than 150 Palestinians for questioning in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> after empty bottles were thrown at an army patrol, the army said. Four of those questioned were detained. _ A pipe bomb exploded outside a bank in a shopping center in the northern Israeli city of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> while police tried to dismantle it. Two parked cars were damaged, but there were no injuries, police said. _ Members of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s surrogate militia in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> shot to death two men during a prison riot by inmates demandin to be included in a proposed exchange with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, military sources said. Reports from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said a Palestinian group, not identified, had offered to trade the body of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier for Arab prisoners.

 Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> departed for <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Monday to tour the newly opened <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and cross into <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> 26 years after his brother's historic `` Ich bin ein Berliner'' speech. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the first high-ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official to plan a visit to the wall since East Germans were allowed to stream through to the West, was to meet Tuesday with former West German Chancellor <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>. It was <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> who, as mayor of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, greeted President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> on June 26, 1963, the day <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> spoke to a throng blocks from the wall dividing East from West. `` I think all of us have watched in awe in recent weeks as a new spirit of freedom has swept throughout <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and nowhere is this spirit greater than in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said in an interview before catching his flight at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The senator said he was going to pay tribute not only to his brother's visit in 1963 but `` to the spirit of the people who have kept the spirit alive.'' Sen. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> planned no major address in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> but was scheduled to deliver remarks at a memorial to his brother at the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>. `` He's going for personal, not political reasons,'' said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>. After a visit to the Brandenburg Gate and a visit at a memorial to those killed trying to cross over the wall, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> planned to cross into <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> at Checkpoint Charlie, most famous of the once heavily guarded border crossing points. <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> planned to hold private meetings with East German officials. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is also visiting <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> for meetings on defense-related matters. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s speech, two years after construction of the wall, reaffirmed the support of the West for citizens of the blockaded city. It ended with the declaration that in the free world it was a symbol of honor to declare `` I am a Berliner.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s speech was seen as a high point in his presidency and as a touchstone of the Cold War for its clear delineation of the difference in personal liberties between East and West.

 Onetime <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> financial wizard <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> and a close associate pleaded guilty Monday to two counts of a federal indictment accusing them of defrauding an <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> bank of $ 3.9 million. The plea-bargain agreements in the complex case were entered before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> shortly before the two men were to have gone on trial. Butcher, who until 1983 headed a financial empire of 28 banks in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, is serving a 20-year prison term for bank fraud. He lost a race for <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> governor in 1978 and was the chief organizer of the 1982 World's Fair in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>. Also pleading guilty was <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who worked for Butcher at the time the banks failed and is serving a 10-year sentence for bank fraud. Butcher's attorney, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said related conspiracy charges against his client would be dropped. The 89-page indictment alleged that Butcher and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> orchestrated a scheme to obtain fraudulent loans from <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> in 1984-85 using a series of `` straw borrowers'' who would funnel the money to them. Butcher and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> could not obtain loans under their own names because they had filed for bankruptcy and were either under investigation or charged with bank fraud in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, the government alleged. The grand jury charged that <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Wilsons </ORGANIZATION> paid former bank president <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Justice </PERSON> to make the loans. Justice, who was not charged, is serving a 10-year sentence on similar charges in another case. <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> collapsed in 1986. Butcher faces a maximum term of seven years and a fine of up to $ 500,000 on the two counts. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> faces a possible 10 years and a fine of $ 500,000. Prosecutors will recommend that Butcher's time be served concurrently with the sentence he is already serving in a prison in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> said. Butcher had faced a maximum sentence of 71 years in prison and up to $ 4.5 million in fines if convicted in the <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> case, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pesquera </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pesquera </PERSON> would not elaborate on the plea-bargain arrangements because he was prosecuting four other people in the same case, but suggested he did not expect to call Butcher and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> to testify. Also pleading guilty to two counts in the 51-count indictment issued in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> last August was <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Harriette </PERSON>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Streck </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Altamonte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty to one count The other defendants in the case generally served as fraudulent borrowers, <PERSON> Pesquera </PERSON> told the jury in the case against the remaining defendants, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Artrip </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Longwood </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gresham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chitwood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` It was all part of the scheme and pattern,'' he said, asking the jury to `` look at it as a jigsaw puzzle'' with all the pieces fitting together as part of a plan to cheat the bank. Lawyers for <PERSON> Gresham </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Artrips </LOCATION> and Ms. <PERSON> Chitwood </PERSON> argued that all of the loans they obtained were legal and repaid to the bank with interest.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Monday ordered a state law school to provide notes for a deaf student who charged in a lawsuit that the school failed to provide adequate classroom assistance. The temporary restraining order barred <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> from holding two classes attended by <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> unless she receives transcribed notes within 24 hours of each class. `` I've got to satisfy that she gets that information,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brotman </PERSON>. `` It may cost <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> some money, but that's my least concern now.'' Ms. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, 39, a third-year law student who represented herself, sued to be provided with an adequate note-taker or interpreter. `` It's all I wanted _ a note-taker,'' Ms. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> said tearfully after the judge's ruling. `` I'm very satisfied.'' Ms. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, who expects to graduate in December, said the case marks the first time federal civil rights provisions have been used to force a university to supply assistance for a deaf student. She lost her hearing in 1972. She is the only deaf student attending the 700-student law school, school officials said. The university has spent about $ 10,000 a year to provide sign language translators and note-takers for Ms. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Aron </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, the university's attorney. However, he said the school has had a difficult time finding qualified candidates. Ms. Price, who began taking classes at the school's <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> campus in August 1986, said the school agreed to provide note-takers and interpreters for every class. But in June 1987, Ms. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> filed a civil rights claim against the university, contending that it failed to provide the assistance she needed. In a February 1988 settlement, the school agreed to provide aides, but Ms. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> sued again Nov. 12, charging that the school had reneged. Ms. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> said she has been attending a course in advanced constitutional law without a note-taker or an interpreter. For a course in international organizations, she was provided with a note-taker three weeks after the semester began. But the notes were illegible and she refused to accept them. Fall semester classes are scheduled to end on Friday.

 Detroit's two daily newspapers, the nation's ninth - and tenth-largest papers, launched their long-stalled partial merger Monday, as union and management officials resumed contract `` I think the feeling is, we are close. I'm optimistic we can reach an agreement,'' <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Giles </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said he also expected to reach an agreement with five of the newspapers' six unions by a 12:01 a.m. Thursday strike deadline. The press operators<ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graphics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> ratified a contract Sunday. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the combined operations, said Monday night talks would continue until the two sides agree. `` I am totally convinced that everything will be resolved and that there will not be a strike,'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said. The main issue was money. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mleczko </PERSON>, president of Local 22 of the <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, said management negotiators offered a $ 30-per-week raise during the first year of a 2 -LCB- - year contract, $ 30 in the second year, $ 15 for the remaining six months, and a signing bonus equal to two weeks' pay for the approximately 3,300 employees at the papers The unions seek raises totaling $ 110 weekly during the 2 -LCB- - year contract plus a three-week pay bonus, said <PERSON> Mleczko </PERSON> The average salary of all workers at the two newspapers, excluding benefits, is about $ 570 weekly, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. Many newspaper employees have had only one raise since 1986, when News owner <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> owner <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced plans to pursue the joint operating agreement, under which business operations are merged while editorial departments remain separate With the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> in place, the Free Press remains a morning newspaper while the News will generally have afternoon home deliveries. There will be joint weekend editions, under the masthead of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and Free Press. According to figures released Nov. 13, the daily circulation of the News is 690,422 and 832,382 on Sundays, and the Free Press' is 626,434 daily and 687,537 Sundays. The <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>'s path was cleared, after years of legal challenges from a coalition of readers and advertisers, when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> tied 4-4 on Nov. 13 after hearing an appeal. The tie let stand lower court rulings that approved the 100-year agreement.

 A 53-man British trade mission began a week of meetings Monday to explore the possibility of resuming commercial relations interrupted by the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> war of 1982.

<TEXT>
 The ho-ho's of a shopping mall <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> turned into uh-oh's over the weekend. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Tysons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> were shocked to discover that their jolly old elf was handing out to tots copies of a children's book containing the startling message that there's really no <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>. There, on page 86 of `` A Pee Wee Christmas,'' fresh from <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nick </ORGANIZATION>'s very own toy sack, was the revelation by one of the book's characters that <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> is a fake, just like his paste-on beard and padded stomach The books were yanked Saturday and replaced with Christmas stickers and fingerprinting kits, but not before copies of `` A Pee Wee Christmas'' had been dispensed to 300 or 400 innocent tots who had climbed onto <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>'s lap in the previous week. The mall was alerted by a complaint from <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON>, a nurse from nearby <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who had taken her 4-year-old son, <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>, to meet <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>. `` I read the story to <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> at bedtime,'' she said, `` and he fell asleep before I got to the juicy part, fortunately.'' Said Tysons Corner general manager <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>: `` What can I say? We screwed up.'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said mall officials had screened more than a dozen books looking for an appropriate <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> gift, but `` we just flat missed'' the troublesome passage in their final selection. The book tells the tale of a 7-year-old named <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> who is ridiculed by his friends for saying he believes in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>. His friend <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> decides to set him straight. Here is the `` juicy part'' that raised Mrs. <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON>'s eyebrows: `` <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON>,'' she whispered bravely. `` There is n't any real <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>. Your mom gives you the things on your list. I used to believe in him too. But when you're seven you should know.'' `` I know that,'' said <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON>. `` I knew he was n't real. I saw his beard. It was just pasted on.'' <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> adds that he was just pretending because `` it's more fun to believe.'' The book, part of a `` Pee Wee Scouts'' series that has sold more than 2 million copies, was written by children's author <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Delton </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION>. In a telephone interview Monday, she said her Christmas story had received very few complaints. Ms. <PERSON> Delton </PERSON> said `` A Pee Wee Christmas'' was written for 7 - and 8-year-olds, who already have learned about <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> from television and playground gossip, but was never meant for younger children Nevertheless, she said, `` I was terribly sorry'' when she heard about the flap over her book at the Tysons Corner mall. `` I felt really bad about it, and I can only apologize,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON> said she's glad <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> fell asleep while she was reading `` A Pee Wee Christmas,'' and hopes her son continues to believe in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> for many more years. `` That's the magic of being a child,'' she said. `` I know one day he'll find out, but I do n't want it to be like that.'' Foster expressed chagrin over the incident, and offered this word of advice: `` Do n't believe everything you read.''

Army privates <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopukh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Prokapchuk </PERSON>, both 20 and clad in white, hugged their mothers and wept with them as they were reunited at the fortress-like headquarters of the rebels' self-styled governmment-in-exile `` I'm very happy that I just saw my son and I know that he's coming home,'' said a tearful <PERSON> Valentina </PERSON> <PERSON> Prokapchuk </PERSON> Dozens of mujahedeen, or Islamic `` holy warriors,'' toting Soviet-made AK-47 assault rifles stood guard in their gray dress uniforms as <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> police formed a security ring around the headquarters. <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON>; <PERSON> Sayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON>, acting president of the so-called interim government; and representatives of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> attended the ceremony. `` A reciprocating gesture of good will will take place in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in a couple of days,'' <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON> said. `` This is a good beginning.'' He called it a `` high act of humanitarianism.'' The ambassador said that besides rebel fighters, the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> release will include Pakistanis and citizens of sympathetic <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states captured while fighting inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> alongside Afghan insurgents. Before freeing the two Soviets, the rebels lectured the prisoners' mothers, who were part of a seven-member private delegation from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` I understand that not only these women are weeping today, there are probably many more weeping in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Farooq </PERSON> <PERSON> Azam </PERSON>, an official of the mujahedeen government. `` But let me remind you that thousands of Afghan mothers are crying over the loss of their children.'' <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON> called the release `` ample proof of our good intentions.'' `` Though the war is not yet over we are releasing two more Soviet prisoners to show our humane motives ... in spite of the fact that thousands of our people are held by the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as prisoners.'' Rebel fighters have intermittently exchanged Soviet prisoners during the 11-year-old insurrection in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` The puppet regime, and its supporter, should realize the plight of our nation and should leave in grace and thus stop further bloodshed, before they are terminated by the wrath of our people,'' <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Iona </PERSON> <PERSON> Andronov </PERSON>, spokesman of <LOCATION> Nadezhka </LOCATION> -LRB- Hope -RRB-, a private group which works for the release of Soviet POWs, thanked the mujahedeen leaders and apologized for what he termed `` this bloody war and stupid war, which was started by the politicians and generals.'' In December 1979, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> ordered more than 100,000 combat troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to oversee the replacement of one Marxist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> with another and to help fight a growing Moslem insurgency. The Soviet troop withdrawal was completed last February, in line with a United Nations-brokered accord.

<TEXT>
 Millions of people ignored government pleas and joined a nationwide general strike Monday in the largest and most dramatic demonstration so far for democracy and an end to <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rule. `` We do n't want you anymore!'' a flag-waving crowd of 200,000 roared in a thunderous chant that echoed off the 19th-century buildings surrounding downtown Wenceslas Square. It was the 11th straight day of massive protests in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Huge crowds of workers also poured into the streets of <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, the east Slovak industrial center of <LOCATION> Kosice </LOCATION>, the mining center of <LOCATION> Ostrava </LOCATION> on the Polish border, and in <LOCATION> Usti </LOCATION> <LOCATION> nad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Labem </LOCATION>, the heart of industrial north <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION>. The showing was a resounding victory for the opposition, which had called the two-hour strike a referendum on the Communists' 40-year monopoly on power Communist leaders' frantic attempts to avert the strike failed, as workers joined the pro-democracy movement started by students, artists and intellectuals. Shaken leaders continued to make new concessions to the opposition: _ The party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> dumped three more hard-liners from the ruling Politburo, the second major leadership reshuffle in three days. _ The Czech and Slovak ministries of culture announced they had lifted most forms of press censorship. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved an inquiry by a parliamentary commission into a Nov. 17 rally in which riot police clubbed hundreds of peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators. _ Deputy premier <PERSON> Jaromir </PERSON> <PERSON> Zak </PERSON> said on state TV that after long discussion, it was decided to drop the article enshrining the leading role of the Communists in the constitution from a new draft of the document. `` Every political party has the right to a leading role as long as it is based on results,'' he said. `` It's not possible to lay this down in the constitution.'' _ The official <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency said parliament, until now a rubber-stamp body under firm Communist control, also would be open to discussion of any draft laws. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Janku </PERSON>, head of the state's commission on church affairs, was quoted as saying these would include new laws on religion that would end state control over churches and the criticized practice of licensing priests. But there were still more conditions to be met. Posters demanding free elections and an end to one-party rule were plastered over the windows of shops, hotels and restaurants that closed to observe the strike. At <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s largest industrial complex, CKD, workers demanded the formation of independent trade unions. Hundreds of thousands of joyous workers streamed into the city's center, carrying banners of their factories, firms and offices in an outpouring of national pride and support for democratic reforms Sirens howled and church bells pealed as the strike began at noon. `` Look <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON>, how thick the crowd is!'' the people chanted, referring to President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, the man who headed the crackdown on democratic reforms after a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion in 1968. `` Dubcek to the Castle!'' they yelled, referring to <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, the ousted leader of the failed `` Prague Spring'' reforms who was replaced as party leader by <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>. Hradcany Castle, a national symbol, is the presidential residence. `` It has to go to the very end,'' said <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Cervenkova </PERSON>, who was among the demonstrators. `` As long as the Communists rule, it's going to be messed up as it was for the last 40 years. More than 200,000 people attended another mass rally in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Monday afternoon, continuing the series of protests that have yielded major government concessions to opposition demands. <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON>, a spokesman for the opposition group Civic Forum, called off any rallies for Tuesday, when the opposition meets the government for more negotiations. Communist Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> on Sunday held an unprecedented meeting with opposition leaders to try to contain the peaceful revolt. `` Demands of the Civic Forum have been met in principle or are being met,'' <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> said. But he warned that the rallies would resume if negotiators fail to make progress toward democratic reforms. `` The fundamental condition in our talks is the holding of free elections,'' <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> told the crowd. <PERSON> Valtr </PERSON> <PERSON> Komarek </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Forecasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, branded the current orthodox Communist system `` a message from the valley of shadows.'' Actors and students groups in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION>, have proposed that <PERSON> Komarek </PERSON> be named premier. State TV, which has played a key role in the dizzyingly rapid popular revolt, broadcast footage from industrial centers around the country, showing crowds of hundreds of thousands attending strike rallies. State radio said all enterprises were affected by the strike, although most had skeleton crews on duty so that production would not be halted completely. In <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, dissident <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simecka </PERSON> read a message from <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, the nation's most prominent opposition leader, who said `` have no fear, the future is ours.'' When a speaker at the rally mentioned <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, the crowd of 100,000 people responded with a deafening roar. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> has made a dramatic political comeback after two decades of political exile, addressing huge crowds four days running in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and his native <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>. In another development, exiled actor <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> <PERSON> Landovsky </PERSON> and writer <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohout </PERSON> were allowed into the country for the first time in more than 10 years and addressed the people gathered in downtown <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Plzen </LOCATION>, about 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, workers at the gigantic Skoda heavy machinery works ignored management appeals to remain on plant property and joined a crowd of demonstrators downtown, state radio reported.

 <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, accused by Salvadoran authorities of maintaining a cache of ammunitition and explosives, was defended Monday by her mother and friends in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> as a peaceful church worker. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` There's not much doubt that the material was there ... I do n't know about her role.'' Casolo, 28, a translator and tour coordinator for an ecumenical group based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was arrested Sunday after a predawn raid by Salvadoran police on her <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> home. Maj. <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON>, a Salvadoran armed forces spokesman, said 40,000 rounds of ammunition for U.S.-made M-16 rifles, 40,000 rounds of ammunition for Soviet-designed AK-47 rifles, 203 blocks of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> and 403 detonator caps were found in <LOCATION> Casolo </LOCATION>'s house and at other locations. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said the arms cache `` proves church involvement'' with the Salvadoran rebels, known as the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. He did not elaborate. `` It's fairly clear that these weapons were found there,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday. `` I mean, we're not talking about a small package of pistols here. We're talking about tons of equipment and mortars and dynamite and rounds of ammunitions and explosives. This is hardly a case of someone having a few things flipped in their shopping bag on the way home.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blatz </PERSON>, a spokesman for the group <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> worked for, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminar </ORGANIZATION>, called the accusations against <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> `` ridiculous'' and `` part of their -LRB- the government's -RRB- persecution of the churches. That's clear.'' <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, also rejected the charges. `` <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> is working for the church,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> said. `` She is working to help the poor people.'' Since her 1983 graduation from <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> has worked at a soup kitchen in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and taught English to refugees in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. In 1984, she went to a village in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, where she taught adults. Four years ago she went to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to organize tours for delegations from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, a friend from <ORGANIZATION> Thomaston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` She would take them around,'' she said. `` They would see government officials. They would go to refugee camps, the cooperatives they had down there. From the left to the right, she tried to give the delegations a real feel for what was going on in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.'' Another friend of <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s from New Haven who once worked with her in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> said she suspects the ammunition was planted in <LOCATION> Casolo </LOCATION>'s garden by agents of the Salvadoran government. `` They're trying to frame her to justify the actions taken by the military against international church workers in the last two weeks,'' <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutterman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lutterman </PERSON> now works for the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in Solidarity with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>. The group was founded in 1981 to oppose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support of the Salvadoran government. Security forces have raided more than a dozen churches and refugee centers since rebels launched an offensive on the capital Nov. 11. Last week, six Jesuit priests were killed at their dormitory on a university campus in the capital. Human rights organizations say circumstantial evidence points to the Salvadoran military as the priests' killers.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> reaffirmed Monday she will stay in office as long as she is wanted and said reports she will step down soon after the next election `` could not have been further from the truth.'' On her objection to <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> evolution toward a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> would not allow <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s monetary, budgetary and economic policy to be left to the 12 member countries. `` I believe <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is right,'' she said in a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. TV interview `` We are choosing between the British parliament and a group of people who are not accountable. I believe our views will prevail as people look at it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> would `` go far further and have far better results if we cooperate as 12 sovereign nations, voluntarily cooperating on the things we do best,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, 64, has swept the Conservatives to three successive election victories and is the longest-serving <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prime minister this century. `` I shall stay as long as the electorate and my own party wish me to do, not a moment longer, but I hope as long as that,'' she said Monday, adding she is fit and loves her work. She expressed concern about the effect of next week's <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership election, saying, `` I think at the moment, uncertainty about anything connected with the government is not good _ but I would not like to use that to hinder anyone who wants to stand. The Conservatives have routinely endorsed her leadership since 1975. This year she faces a challenge from 69-year-old Sir <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, a rank-and-file legislator. Voting is scheduled for Dec. 5. Under Tory rules, she must get 57 percent of the votes to win outright. If she does not, some more prominent candidate than <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> would be expected to enter the race in a second ballot.

<HEAD>Amtrak Trial Over Sewage Dumping Begins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALATKA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> told a jury Monday that a federal law exempts the passenger rail service from being prosecuted for dumping sewage into public waterways from train bridges. The case marks the first time <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> has gone to court on criminal charges, although several Western states have criticized its habit of flushing toilets along its right-of-way. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Trammel </PERSON> testified Monday that they were sprayed by a dark, watery substance from an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train as they fished below a trestle over the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> said the rail service never intended to violate a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law that bans dumping sewage into public waterways. But even if the law was broken, attorneys said, federal law exempts <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> from prosecution. A 1972 federal law allows <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> to dispose of waste by dumping it along its right-of-way because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> found the company could not comply with a federal health study prohibiting the practice, attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said. However, Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayer </PERSON> told jurors that the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law does count. The charges stem from incidents in November and December 1988 and May 1989. <ORGANIZATION> Bayer </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> in those months allegedly dumped human waste into the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rice </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> as trains crossed bridges. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> is on trial on four counts of commercial littering and one count of causing a nuisance. The littering charges are felonies under <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law. Although the statute calls for fines and jail times, the state is merely seeking to have the practice stopped, prosecutors have said. The railroad has threatened to suspend service to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where it carries about 1 million passengers a year, if the state continues to press its case. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> officials have said it would be too costly to put holding tanks on its existing trains, although it hopes eventually to replace much of its fleet with new cars that would have holding tanks for all toilets. The case is expected to go to the jury Wednesday.

 This farming community's hunt for a missing 18-year-old honors student ended Monday when searchers found her body in the shallow <LOCATION> Nooksack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The body was identified as that of <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Stavik </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Whatcom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> told a news conference. <PERSON> Stavik </PERSON> had been missing since she went jogging Friday with her dog, <PERSON> Kyra </PERSON>, while home from college on Thanksgiving break. The dog returned alone. Authorities believe <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Stavik </PERSON> was abducted, said <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, who would not comment on the body's condition or how Miss <PERSON> Stavik </PERSON> died. An autopsy will be conducted, he said. There was no evidence of a struggle on the bank near where the body was found, leading authorities to suspect it floated downstream, the sergeant said. He said detectives were still looking for clues. There were no suspects in the case, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. Until Monday, authorities had seized upon a pair of teal blue sweatpants recovered in the area as their only potential clue. Miss <PERSON> Stavik </PERSON> was wearing that color garment when she was last seen. <LOCATION> Whatcom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials had asked the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> for help and planned to enlist the aid of the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, a Seattle-based team of detectives with expertise in abduction that was formed to pursue a serial killer. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> helped interview classmates of Miss Stavik at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ellensburg </LOCATION>. The sweatpants were discovered 10 miles from the <PERSON> Stavik </PERSON> family's home in this town of 250 people in northwestern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, 80 miles north of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and 20 miles south of the Canadian border `` You think of those things happening in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> but not here,'' <PERSON> LoBay </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said from behind the cash register at <ORGANIZATION> Acme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, where customers had pledged $ 7,000 to anyone finding `` <PERSON> Mandy </PERSON>,'' as Miss <PERSON> Stavik </PERSON> was known. Many of the Staviks' neighbors had joined the search in the evergreen-studded foothills and along Highway 9, a busy road connecting <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and its suburbs with the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baker </LOCATION> ski area. Miss <PERSON> Stavik </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, had worked to keep her mind from dwelling on her missing daughter. `` She was very happy and positive and feeling good about school,'' Ms. <PERSON> Stavik </PERSON> said Sunday. She said her daughter had brought a Japanese exchange student home for the holiday. Miss <PERSON> Stavik </PERSON> was last seen about a half-mile from her home by her younger brother, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, 13. Her mother thought she had jogged the three miles to the south fork of the <LOCATION> Nooksack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who was visiting a neighbor at the time, said it looked like his sister was on her way back from the river. The sweatpants, recovered near an unpaved road where garbage is sometimes dumped, did not prove to be solid evidence. Although they are the same color as sweatpants Miss <PERSON> Stavik </PERSON> was wearing when last seen, bloodhounds failed to identify the garment as Miss <PERSON> Stavik </PERSON>'s, and her mother could n't be certain they were her daughter's. Detectives said their best leads may come from passers-by who might have noticed something suspicious along the highway. The road has about four times the traffic as normal because of a washed-out bridge and the opening of ski season at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baker </LOCATION>, said Undersheriff <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>. `` We're hoping somebody saw something and will give us a call,'' he said. Investigators also have pulled the parole records of sexual predators or other criminals who were known to be in the area, said <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>.

 Federal agents seized nearly six tons of cocaine in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s largest cocaine bust and killed six drug traffickers in the operation, Attorney General <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said Monday. He said the cocaine was linked to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel and the traffickers were trying to smuggle the drugs overland to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, seated beside thousands of packets containing tons of cocaine, called last week's operation `` the biggest cocaine bust in the history of our country.'' He said a half-dozen traffickers were killed, two federal police were wounded and five suspects were captured during a gun battle in a mountainous area of <LOCATION> Oaxaca </LOCATION> state, 300 miles south of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The attorney general gave this account at a news conference: Last Thursday highway police found a few pounds of cocaine in a truck in <LOCATION> Oaxaca </LOCATION> and the driver and a passenger told them about another truck. The second truck was stopped and it was carrying 1,190 pounds of cocaine. The driver also told officials where cocaine was being stored in the mountains for shipment `` overland in small quantities.'' When federal drug agents closed in on the location over the weekend there was a gunfight in which six trafficker were killed and to agents were wounded. Five suspects were arrested and others are being sought. After the gun battle the agents found 187 canvas bags stuffed with 4.5 tons of cocaine. He said only that the raid occurred over the weekend but police sources said it was late Friday or early Saturday. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> reported the suspects said the cocaine had been received from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, at a clandestine landing strip and shipments had been arriving since February. He said the shipments were arranged by <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, a kingpin in the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel who is wanted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. In recent months many drug arrests have included suspects linked to Colombian gangs, but <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said he did n't believe Colombian cartels are using Mexican routes more often than before. He attributed the increased arrests and drug seizures to greater vigilance by police agents.

 Funeral services were held Monday for two of the children killed by a tornado that slammed into their elementary school. One victim's mother said her son's organs would help keep other children alive. More than 200 mourners attended a funeral service in this city for <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, 7, and 175 gathered for a service in <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Homan </PERSON>, 8. Both died Wednesday of injuries suffered Nov. 16, when a tornado brought a cafeteria wall on more than 100 students lunching at <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coldenham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Nine children were killed and 16 were injured. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, told mourners at Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church that her son's kidneys, heart valves and lymph nodes were donated to help young transplant patients. `` Mark, you will hlp children live on,'' she told her son's cream-and-gold-colored casket Mrs. <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, who has seen two other children die and suffered two miscarriages, said her faith made the family's latest tragedy easier to bear. `` That's what gives me the strength to say goodbye to you, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, to know that I will see you again and my other children,'' she said. `` The lad is with God,'' said Monsignor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Valastro </PERSON> of Sacred Heart. He called the boy a saint. Eight clergy members attended the service, including Episcopal Bishop <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>, the vicar of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>'s casket was escorted from the church by an honor guard of firefighters, some of whom were first on the scene following the twister. Firefighters also attended <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>'s funeral, and a firetruck led a procession of about 30 cars from a funeral home in <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION> to a cemetery in nearby <LOCATION> Phillipsburgh </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Defense Minister <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Monday the anti-aircraft rockets found at the site of a plane crash in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> could have been from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shipment sent years ago to Nicaraguan rebels. The Salvadoran government on Sunday suspended relations with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, accusing the Sandinistas of shipping the rockets and other weapons to leftist guerrillas. A light plane with no registration number crashed Saturday about 60 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> capital, and military officers said three crewmen were killed and the fourth committed suicide, shooting himself in the head. The plane did not burn and Salvadoran troops found in the wreckage 24 Soviet-made SA-7 anti-aircraft rockets, one U.S.-manufactured Redeye rocket, a Soviet-designed recoilless rifle and 21 Soviet mortar shells. Salvadoran military officials said the plane's flight originated in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the craft crashed when it ran out of fuel. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has denied over the years repeated charges that it was supplying aid to the Salvadoran rebels. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the rockets found Saturday could be part of a shipment of 300 that the former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration sent to Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras. `` Was n't it the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that in 1985 put in the hands of terrorists the rockets that we do n't know now where they are? They can be in many different hands and markets,'' the defense minister said. He made the comments at a ceremony marking Soldier's Day with promotions and medals for troops wounded fighting the U.S.-backed Contras. The defense minister is the brother of President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. Foreign Minsiter <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> told reporters <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has received no official notification from the Salvadoran governemnt about a suspension of relations. `` We do not know what they are going to do. We have not broken relations with them,'' <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> said. Speaking about the arms shipment, he said, `` We know nothing about the plane.'' The Salvadoran diplomatic action could disrupt plans for a Dec. 8 meeting in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> of five Central American presidents to resume talks on the peace process for the region that includes demobilization of the Contras.

 President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> formally opened <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>'s new headquarters beside the <LOCATION> Rhone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> Monday and urged law enforcement officials from 147 countries to stop the trade in illegal drugs. He told about 500 delegates at the organization's 58th annual conference that losing the fight against drugs would represent `' a collective failure of civilization.'' The $ 22.5 million headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> _ replaced the organization's cramped facilities in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> suburb of St. Cloud. <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> acts as a clearing house for information among 147 countries. It does no investigating itself but provides members with data on drug trafficking, terrorism and financial and other crimes. <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> officials say the new offices will allow the the organization to expand its forensic capabilities and photo and fingeprint files. It also will have a $ 645,000 communications system capable of receiving and sending 7,000 messages per hour by telephone, telex and radio. The structure will be easier to guard against attacks such as the bombing by the Direct Action terrorist group in May 1986 that wounded a police guard and seriously damaged the six-story building in St. Cloud.

 A <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> newspaper that was bombed because of its coverage of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s drug trade is getting a helping hand from newspaper publishers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and elsewhere in its effort to stave off bankruptcy. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fichter </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, one of two trade associations coordinating a drive to raise funds for the troubled daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> newspaper should receive the initial instalment on a loan this week. <PERSON> Fichter </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> has declared that it needs $ 2.5 million to continue publishing because of the bombing and other losses it has suffered from the campaign against it by the Colombian drug cartel. `` Right now we have got about $ l. 6 million pledged or paid and there are sufficient people we have n't heard from yet that we think will bring us to the $ 2.5 million mark,'' <PERSON> Fichter </PERSON> said The president of <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, toured the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in October seeking support from news organizations. He said a car bomb that exploded near the newspaper's offices on Sept. 2 did $ 2.5 million worth of damage. `` They had to pull out the windows and put on news roofs and incur other expenses, not knowing where they were going to get the money to pay for it,'' <PERSON> Fichter </PERSON> said. `` Not to mention the fact their advertising lineage has been curtailed because many of the advertisers have been intimidated.'' <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>'s younger brother, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, publisher of the paper, was killed by drug traffickers in 1986. Two employes of the newspaper in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, where the drug cartel has its headquarters, were killed in October. The newspaper suspended home delivery in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> because of fear on the part of truck drivers and delivery boys. <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> has a circulation of 350,000. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> has said it is losing money and facing possible bankruptcy. <PERSON> Fichter </PERSON> said, `` I think it struck a number of people all at one time that something needed to be done.'' Among them, he said, were newspaper executives and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelb </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, director of public liaison for the <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION>., said in a letter to executives of news organizations Monday that <PERSON> Gelb </PERSON> `` took his concerns to newspaper publishers who agreed to try to raise money to keep <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION>'s presses running. <PERSON> Gelb </PERSON> visited the newspaper's offices in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> on Oct. l5. <PERSON> Fichter </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> ANPA </ORGANIZATION> is working with the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> in coordinating the fund-raising campaign. He said money or pledges had been received from about 50 donors in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Both <PERSON> Fichter </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said money would be available to help other newspapers after <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Espectador </PERSON>'s needs had been met. `` The money is a loan,'' he said. `` They will give it back, and that will perepetuate it.'' <PERSON> Fichter </PERSON> said the fund-raising effort was the largest of its kind that he knew of, although the trade associations have helped troubled newspapers in various countries in the past. After the fighting in <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> in 1984, for instance, they helped the newspaper in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island obtain a new press to replace one that had been destroyed.

 More than one in 10 American smokers quit at least for Nov. 16, the day of the Great American Smokeout, according to a poll released Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. The poll of 1,201 men and women ages 18 and over found that 10.5 percent of cigarette smokers did not smoke at all that day and that 25.4 percent said they cut down on the amount they usually smoke. Society officials commissioned The <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> survey, which found that 35.9 percent, or 17.9 million, of the nation's 50 million smokers participated in the smokeout. About three-quarters of those who quit for the day reported that they were not smoking at least one day later, according to the poll conducted by telephone Nov. 17-19. The cancer society said in a statement that 3.9 million were still not smoking one to three days later. `` Once again we are very pleased that more than one-third of the nation's hard-core smokers -LRB- nearly 18 million -RRB- participated in this year's Great American Smokeout,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schweitzer </PERSON>, national president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, based in suburban <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>. Noting the large number of smokers who quit for longer than the smokeout, <PERSON> Schweitzer </PERSON> said, `` These statistics are a testament to smokers' increasing awareness of the dangers posed by cigarette smoking, and their desire to try to quit this addictive habit.'' The study also found that more younger people tried to quit for the day. The poll indicated 42 percent of those in the 18-34 age group tried to quit compared with 33 percent in the 35-49 age group and 34 percent in the 50-and-over group. Poll results showed 85 percent of adults surveyed had heard of the Great American Smokeout, which the cancer society hopes will stir smokers to quit. Last year, 86 percent of the respondents heard of the effort. Neither the American Cancer Society nor Gallup released the margin of error.

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s ultraright-wing <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> released on Monday a campaign platform calling for a reunited <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that would include territory lost in World War II. Party chief <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenhuber </PERSON>, a former Waffen SS trooper, announced the platform for next year's elections and said the Republicans have set up organizations in `` several locations'' in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

It said security officials will continue to fight all fascist, neo-Nazi and racist tendencies. The Republicans' platform for the December 1990 federal elections in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> calls for a confederation between the two German states as a first step. It said free and secret elections would follow to choose leaders of a unified <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government based in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>.

 A truck driver testified Monday how he snatched some children from a burning church bus amid `` a constant barrage of screams'' from the 27 people who were trapped and killed. The bus was `` blazing furiously'' soon after it was struck by <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s pickup on Interstate 71, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` There was a huge fireball. It was blazing. ... It was just light like day,'' <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> said on the third day of testimony in <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s trial in <ORGANIZATION> Carroll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 36, is charged with 27 counts of murder. He also is charged with 12 counts of first-degree assault, 42 counts of wanton endangerment and one count of drunken driving. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> is alleged to have driven in the wrong direction of I-71, missing <PERSON> Thom </PERSON>'s tractor-trailer and several other cars and trucks before slamming into the bus at 10:55 p.m. on May 14, 1988.

He said he dashed to the back door of the bus and started dragging children out one by one while his wife dragged survivors off the pavement and into the grass median of the highway. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said he got `` maybe 25 or 30'' children out, but smoke and heat kept him from rescuing more. Forty passengers survived the wreck. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> said he ground his truck to a halt and sprinted to the burning bus. `` There was just a constant barrage of screams, cries for help _ people crying out, constant,'' he said. A few people were able to extend an arm or leg through the smoke and fire toward the rear door `` and I just pulled,'' <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> said. He rescued `` three or four at the most,'' <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> said. `` The heat and flames drove me away.'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> buried his face in one hand during <PERSON> Thom </PERSON>'s testimony, tears streaming down his cheeks.

 A leader of the Afghan resistance said Monday he hopes President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will persuade Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at their weekend summit to stop supporting the `` puppet regime'' of <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sibghatullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the Oval Office to thank him and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people for backing the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> rebels in their 11-year fight to oust the Soviet-backed government. <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON> later told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that he would ask <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials for high altitude anti-aircraft weapons to use against Soviet planes that he said were still flying bombing missions from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> territory. `` Still, the Russians our bombing our people, the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION>, from their own territory,'' said <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON> did not ask <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> directly for the weapons but said he would raise the issue before he departs <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday. He also said that while he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not discuss next week's meeting off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> between the two superpower leaders, `` I am sure that he will discuss -LRB- <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> -RRB- It is a very important issue.'' `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> must be convinced that this is a puppet regime, that the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> people do not support this ... puppet regime,'' he said. <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON> is the president of the Afghan Interim Government formed by seven main resistance groups after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> completed the pullout of 115,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> last February. Covert <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military support for the rebels is reported to exceed $ 500 million a year, but so far the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not granted formal recognition to the rebels' government-in-exile based in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had hoped the resistance would quickly topple <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>'s government after the Soviet pullout. The rebels control most of the Afghan countryside, but so far have been unable to dislodge the Kremlin-backed forces from the capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> or from <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and other major cities. White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in a statement that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` reaffirmed our support for the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> resistance's efforts to achieve self-determination and also expressed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest in a political settlement. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` called upon the Afghan Interim Government to continue and increase its efforts to fashion a stable, broadly based government responsive to the needs of the Afghan people.'' <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON>, asked why the rebels have been unable to topple <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>, said the Soviets have withdrawn `` partly from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, not completely.'' He said of Soviet soldiers, `` Still they are fighting in the name of Afghans inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' and he also said Soviet planes conduct bombing runs from their own territory against northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He charged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has doubled or tripled its support for the <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> government since the pullout to at least $ 300 million a month. And he said the rebels did not get supplies for eight or nine months. Asked about factional strife among the resistance fighters, <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON> called that `` wrong propaganda. We are not fighting amongst ourselves. We are all united. ... Sometimes it happens, but rarely, seldom.'' `` The Mujahedeen from different parties, they are united. And if we were not united, we would not have achieved such progress in our struggle,'' he said.

 A hearing on whether the tanker captain whose ship caused the nation's largest oil spill should stand trial got under way Monday with witnesses recounting the hours after the Exxon Valdez ripped its hull open. One said oil was welling up alongside the tanker at `` a rolling boil.'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, fired as an <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> tanker captain after the spill of nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil, sat with his counsel while they argued defense motions intended to show <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> is immune from the charges against him. Defense motions include claims that <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> received immunity from prosecution when he reported his ship's grounding and the oil spill the morning it happened. A law intended to encourage self-reporting of environmental calamities such as oil spills provides protection against self-incrimination, laywers contend. That led state Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Linton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to argue that discovery of the spill was inevitable and that information about the disaster was available from a variety of sources, not only from <LOCATION> Hazelwood </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was in charge of the 987-foot tanker when it hit the reef early March 24 after leaving the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil pipeline terminal at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. The ship's cargo of heavy North Slope crude oil poured into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, blackening shores, killing wildlife and interrupting fishing seasons. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, 43, a veteran mariner from <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, is scheduled for trial Jan. 22 on charges of reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil, all misdemeanors, and three felony counts of criminal mischief. <PERSON> Linton </PERSON> called witnesses <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Fish and Wildlife Protection Trooper <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Delozier </PERSON>, whose work as a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> investigator in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> ended Nov. 1. Lawyers on both sides questioned Lawn about his activities after <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> notified him of the spill less than an hour after the crash. Lawn, his agency's top representative in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> at the time of the accident, said he called his <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> supervisor and told him `` this was the nightmare we had been dreading.'' <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> said he went to the ship with the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> a couple hours after the crash and found oil welling up around the vessel _ `` a rolling boil, if you will.'' He said he saw <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, who appeared `` quiet and pensive,'' but did n't speak to him beyond an introduction. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said he was contacted by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and assumed he was wanted to help `` deal with a drunken sailor.'' `` I got up onto the bridge fully expecting to have to deal with a drunk-type situation, and it was n't that at all,'' he said. `` It was a very sad, quiet-type situation.'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said he was asked to obtain a blood sample from <LOCATION> Hazelwood </LOCATION> because intoxication was suspected. But <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said he was n't prepared to collect blood and conduct an investigation without evidence of a crime. The sample was drawn by a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> official about 10 hours after the grounding. The trooper said he was trying to figure out what problem caused the tanker wreck and <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> told him: `` You're looking at it.'' <PERSON> Delozier </PERSON>, who spent two days aboard the tanker after the wreck, said he detected `` a strong odor of alcohol coming from Captain <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>.'' He said <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> apparently had n't been informed about the need to draw samples for alcohol screenings. <PERSON> Delozier </PERSON> also said he urged his wife to talk to state troopers because she recognized <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> from a newspaper photograph about a week after the accident and remembered seeing him in a <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> establishment that serves alcohol. If convicted of the three felonies, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> faces a possible maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and $ 100,000 in fines.

<HEAD>Republicans Trying to Isolate Abortion Issue</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In simpler times, a politician, a president, could tailor his message to fit his audience, and chances were the adjustments would go unnoticed. In the era of instant communications that does n't work very well; television makes all audiences into one. But President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and some other Republican leaders are trying to deal with the abortion issue as though the old way might still work. The objective seems to be to deal with abortion separately, apart from other issues. That's understandable as abortion becomes an increasingly worrisome topic for Republicans, who saw it work against their 1989 candidates. The trouble is that isolating issues is as difficult as fine-tuning speeches. For example, Republicans pride themselves on a philosophy that seeks to keep government from intruding on private decision-making. Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, who favors abortion rights, suggested that <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> tenet could be cast into doubt by a candidate opposed to abortion, since that would involve the government in one of the most sensitive of private decisions. He raised the question at a conference of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governors earlier this month. It already had been answered in one election: <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Democrats made effective use of that theme in narrowly winning the contest for governor. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said in advance there was no evidence that single-issue voters would make abortion a decisive issue. But in the hairbreadth <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> verdict, it almost certainly influenced enough votes to shape the outcome. That points to the Democratic course in dealing with abortion in the 1990 campaign. Their 1989 candidates succeeded in claiming the center on the issue. Strategists for both parties agree that is where the majority of the voters are, pro and anti-abortion zealotry notwithstanding. `` My sense on this issue is that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are in the middle,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, the drug policy chief, offering the governors' conference some unsolicited advice. But the Republicans have had more trouble getting there. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s own position has come all the way from support for the 1973 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that legalized abortion to ardent, active opposition. He vetoed four appropriations bills this fall because they would have permitted the use of tax dollars to pay for abortions for needy women who were victims of rape or incest. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would permit abortion in those cases, but not with public funds. The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> platform advocates a constitutional amendment to bar abortions. That does n't bind anybody; as <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders hasten to point out, party platforms usually are ignored. But it does set a starting point. The national party position that counts is the one anti-abortion course President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is setting. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has been urging the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn its original abortion decision. That call is repeated in administration briefs on two cases that are to be argued before the court tomorrow, on <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> laws requiring that parents be notified before abortions are performed on their teen-age daughters. On a narrowed issue such as parental advice or consent for teen-age abortions, the opinion surveys and the political strategists agree that a candidate probably could find majority backing. When it is broadened and simplified into a flat yes or no on abortion rights, it's hard to handle. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there is plenty of room in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for differing opinions on abortion, and among Democrats, too. On Nov. 14, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with four Republican women <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who support abortion rights, listened to their arguments, but said his own views are not subject to change. His spokesman then said that agreement on abortion was not a test of support; that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would back all Republican candidates, without regard to positions differing from his own. Two of the four <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> women want to move to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in the 1990 elections, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned for them last week. He avoided the abortion issue, speaking as though it did n't exist. At a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> fundraising reception for Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the congresswoman has been `` right on issue after issue. She thinks like I do, like you do.'' Then he went to Providence in behalf of Rep. <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, and praised her independence. `` I always know exactly where she stands,'' the president said. Flying home on Air Force One, he vetoed another bill because of abortion funding. Rep. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a presidential passenger, said she was disappointed. Looking for the lessons of 1989, Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> and other Republican leaders are counseling 1990 candidates to take clear positions on abortion, state them early in the campaign, and stand firm. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told the governors he wo n't mind if Republicans are a minority because they stand on principle. He holds office by appointment.

<HEAD>Today's Puzzle: What Is an American Company Doing Helping Japan?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Imagine an American company that sponsors a science prize in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to `` breed a succession of next-generation Japanese Nobel Prize winners.'' Imagine an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> company that calls itself `` a valuable source of European strength in the drive for greater efficiency, and in competition for world markets.'' What is this American company doing, shooting itself in the foot? No. The company is <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and it is acting very much in its own self-interest. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s generosity in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and elsewhere may not please congressmen and government officials who are trying to build up the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to fight foreign rivals. But then, that's not <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s goal <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, as its name implies, is a truly international company that just happens to have headquarters on a wooded hilltop in a small town about 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Overseas, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is happy to be thought of as a local company. The perception helps the company sell more locally, hire the best people in each country and get good treatment from local governments on such issues as taxes and tariffs. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, is proud of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s success in spreading its research, manufacturing, sales and service operations into every corner of the world `` <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> to some degree has successfully lost its American identity,'' the senior vice president in charge of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said in an interview in his corner office earlier this year. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is the very model of a modern multinational. Others include <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> and, to a lesser degree, American companies such as <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which are entrenched in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and have alliances with Japanese automakers. The future belongs to such companies, which float above national boundaries, obeying the rules in every country where they operate but belonging to no country in particular. These companies are not merely multinationals, but transnationals, transcending international borders. It takes real effort to change perspective and see companies in this light. Most political leaders continue to miss the point by judging companies according to where their headquarters happen to be. Governments of individual nations are going to have to learn how to deal with transnational companies in ways that benefit their own people. It is not an easy task, because governments have less leverage against a transnational than against a company that does all its business locally. A transnational company is like a living organism, with each part dependent on the others for survival. A government that tried to nationalize an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> factory would find itself with a useless asset because <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> would cut the factory off from its worldwide system of distribution, manufacturing and research. Fortunately for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> does have a strong commitment to this country, which after all remains its largest single market and source of employees. For example, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has shared some of its most advanced computer chip technology with other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to assure itself of a steady supply of chips from outside suppliers. On the other hand, U.S.-based transnationals like <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> have few qualms about importing parts and even whole products for the American market, even though making them here would create more jobs for Americans in design and manufacturing. The point is not that these companies are somehow disloyal or treacherous. The point is that their interests do not always match the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national interest. The issue is more important than ever now that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is debating how to dole out the benefits of an industrial policy _ that is, a program to improve the ability of this nation to compete in world markets. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, a professional skeptic, put it this way in an essay earlier this year in The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>: `` Our economic future, as well as our national security, is better served by developing a large corps of technologically sophisticated workers within the nation than by boosting the profitability of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s global corporations.''

<HEAD>One Year After Quake, Leninakan Mired in Mud and Memories</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LENINAKAN, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A year after an earthquake smashed northwestern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> into rubble, the city of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> is a shantytown of mud and memories. The Garapetyans do laundry by boiling their clothes in a bucket on a tiny wood stove. The stove also heats a makeshift cabin they built from remains of their former apartment building next door. Far above, rain lashes the wallpaper of their old living room on the fourth floor, which was exposed when the side of the building sheared off. `` We're afraid of living in a large building again,'' <PERSON> Meruzhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garapetyan </PERSON> said. Popular songs speak of the disaster of Dec. 7, 1988, when an earthquake measuring 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale killed at least 25,000 people and destroyed the homes of 500,000 more. `` Oh earthquake, what have you done?'' one asks. `` Why did you leave so many parents without their children? ... You covered them with stones and dirt and left their parents in tears.'' The Armenian relief agency Search says 20,000 people still are missing, 2,000 of them children. Daily life is slogging through mud, relying on relatives and wondering when normality will return. A quake of 7.1 magnitude in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area on Oct. 17 killed only 66 people. Damage was estimated at $ 7 billion, but much of the destruction was cleared and service restored within weeks. In <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, <PERSON> Vartan </PERSON> <PERSON> Oganisyan </PERSON> and his family of five live in a shack made from bits of sheet metal, wood scraps, tar paper and salvaged window frames. Other families crowd into half-shattered buildings, construction huts, army tents, round Mongolian yurts, abandoned railway cars and even gasoline tanks fitted with doors and windows. A few open cooking fires can be seen in the twilight. Electrical power is intermittent as <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> enters the bitter Soviet winter. Children bundle up for classes in temporary, unheated buildings. They wake up crying at night and run from classrooms in fright at the slightest noise. After school they play `` earthquake,'' recreating the disaster in the muddy streets. Hundreds of people go to the huge city cemetery after work. Many graves are marked only by the flowers relatives leave. <PERSON> Sofik </PERSON> <PERSON> Torunyan </PERSON>, who lost both children, was there on what would have been her daughter's 20th birthday, with a cake fashioned from carnations. `` Oh, my young daughter! Oh, my love!'' she wailed, holding onto a friend. `` Why did n't I die, too, so I would not have to live without you?'' People struggle on, helping each other. Hospitality and pride remain. A dozen families share the only bathroom on their block that still works. A boy paints the window frame in his family's shack. Visitors are offered coffee and sweets, but often there is no electricity to boil water. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Tumanyan </PERSON>, who lives in the ground floor of a severely cracked five-story building, insists that `` we're making great progress.'' She concentrates on the vast stretches cleared of broken concrete and twisted metal, not the rubble remaining. The town of <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> was leveled. Kirovakan and 300 villages were shattered. In <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, which had 235,000 residents, the quake destroyed 99 nine-story apartment buildings, 10 schools and every factory, officials said. Reconstruction has lagged badly. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, the Soviet premier, said in November that the crash program to rebuild in two years already was a year behind schedule, meaning virtually nothing had been accomplished. Residents blame disorganization, central planning's failure to supply enough building materials and a two-month blockade of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> by ethnic enemies in neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Many foreigners building schools and hospitals went home because supply shipments were held up on rail lines in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. By early November, only three new buildings had been completed, all by the army for the army. <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambartsumyan </PERSON>, chairman of the city <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> committee, still hopes to move 4,000 families into a vast new suburb before year's end, but even that would be only one-fifth as many as planned. For now, <PERSON> Ambartsumyan </PERSON> is concentrating on getting the remaining homeless among the 190,000 people now living in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> into construction huts and other temporary housing, and getting heat for them before winter. <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON> <PERSON> Asaturyan </PERSON> lives in one such hut, generously called a `` little house'' in Russian but in reality a two-room insulated packing crate. She and her family of five must haul water from a block away, use nearby bushes as a toilet and travel to a relative's place for showers. Her washing flaps over a sea of mud. Mrs. <PERSON> Asaturyan </PERSON> is grateful, however, because they used to be in the remains of the towel factory where she once worked, and where 30 of her co-workers were killed. Her `` little house,'' like thousands of others, showed up without a door, window glass, heater, wiring or furniture. It was vandalized en route, apparently by <PERSON> Azerbaijanis </PERSON>, whom the Armenians accuse of stealing or destroying relief supplies. When asked about the Soviet leadership's promise to rebuild in two years, Mrs. <PERSON> Asaturyan </PERSON> said: `` I'll be glad if I get a home within five years.'' About 20,000 of the homeless are scheduled to receive apartments in the new suburb as sections are completed over 18 months. A forest of 129 cranes towers over the site, and buildings faced with local salmon-colored stone gleam in the sun. Because nine-story apartment blocks shoddily built of pre-formed concrete panels collapsed in the quake, the new buildings are made by assembling vault-like precast rooms, foreman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Pogosov </PERSON> said. None is more than four stories high. In May, a commission of the ruling Politburo blamed most of the deaths on shoddy construction and gave its findings to prosecutors. No charges have been filed, said <PERSON> Haik </PERSON> <PERSON> Minasyan </PERSON>, an Armenian government spokesman. Only a few projects are under way in the city itself. On the central square, a statue of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> looks over a scene of devastation: a ruined school, department store, government building, post office, shops and a sock factory. Cafes and movie theaters are gone. So are most food stores, and shopping sometimes amounts to picking over piles of cabbages and potatoes at what remains of the bus station. <PERSON> Ambartsumyan </PERSON> said experts had ruled out reconstruction on half the original city lots because the ground is too unstable.

 His family has n't seen <PERSON> Araik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sukasyan </PERSON> since the earthquake destroyed his school a year ago, but they speak of him celebrating his 13th birthday soon and hope a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> psychic can tell them where. `` We wait to find him alive,'' said his mother, <PERSON> Galine </PERSON>, weeping as she pulled out <PERSON> Araik </PERSON>'s school portrait. She hopes publicity will bring word from someone who has taken him in, if that happened. The fourth grader vanished in the rubble of School No. 9 along with more than 500 other people when the earthquake hit <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> during school hours Dec. 7, 1988. Authorities say it killed 25,000 people, but the Armenian relief agency Search says 20,000 more still are missing, including 2,000 children. `` They are not counted on the list of the dead or on the list of those evacuated,'' said <PERSON> Ashot </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgyan </PERSON>, director of the Search office in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. He said he had no way of knowing how many of the 20,000 were dead and how many were just separated from their families. `` We are now continuing the search for children, particularly orphans, who were sent in groups to various points in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and are still there in sanatoriums and resorts,'' <PERSON> Georgyan </PERSON> said. Many parents, like the Sukasyans, believe officials may have lost track of some evacuees. <PERSON> Larissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vagashakovna </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> office of Search, said she had asked in vain for state television to show pictures of the missing children. `` It's impossible to forget the faces of these parents,'' she said. `` They have n't found the corpse and they have n't found the child. Where have they disappeared to?'' <PERSON> Araik </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Narina </PERSON>, also was in School No. 9 when it crumpled. She escaped, and when her mother came running from home, <PERSON> Narina </PERSON> cried: `` Momma, I am alive, but I ca n't find my brother!'' For a month after the earthquake, the <PERSON> Sukasyan </PERSON> family watched workers claw through the concrete and dust that had been School No. 9. Searchers found the bodies, or identifiable parts of bodies, of 420 students and 26 teachers. There was no sign of 100 others, including <PERSON> Araik </PERSON>. `` There were people where they found only one leg, and identified the shoe or the skirt, and they buried that,'' said <PERSON> Lida </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryan </PERSON>, a teacher at another school and a friend of the family. The Sukasyans searched hospitals, opened every one of thousands of coffins at the cemetery and telephoned relief agencies in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. They found no sign of their son and cling to the hope that someone took him away. `` In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, there is a woman who can see where someone is by looking at his picture. We hope she can help,'' <PERSON> Araik </PERSON>'s mother said. Then she was worried again, because reports say the psychic's powers only work with an original photograph `` This is a copy,'' she said, staring at her son's young, serious face.

 It was a moment <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> savored. One could forgive him if he felt a bit smug as he stood before the large gathering at <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>'s ultramodern convention center. After all, the mighty <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had tried for years to isolate him and, here he was, about to gavel to order one of the largest summit meetings in history. With 55 heads of government on hand for the festivities, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> looked like a man ready to pop a champagne cork. But that was 10 years ago. The memory of that September 1979 summit meeting of the non-aligned movement, a collection of Third World countries, has long since receded. Since then, almost nothing has gone right for <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and, at this juncture, almost 31 years deep into the Cuban revolution, his prospects seldom have looked bleaker, most analysts say. It's hard to imagine any leader who will welcome the passing of the 1980s more earnestly than <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. In an age of pragmatists, he stands almost alone in clinging tenaciously to a socialist orthodoxy that each year seems to have fewer adherents. His anti-Americanism is as unbridled as ever but in a time when economic concerns dominate the global agenda, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is increasingly looked upon as a partner for trade and investment rather than as an expansionist power bent on imposing its will on others, essentially <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s view. Many Third World countries _ <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bissau </LOCATION>, to name a few _ that <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> once saw as partners in the international socialist movement have begun selling off inefficient state industries and are adopting market practices. The disrepute of communism throughout <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is widespread and the demands for democratic reform are becoming increasingly strident. Strikes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and mass protests in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by workers and students have exposed weaknesses in the Marxist approach, but <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s commitment to that course seems unbudging. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has drifted so far from <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s vision of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader has implied he wonders how much longer the 2-decade-old Moscow-Havana alliance can last. While <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> rants about the `` imperialists,'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> makes deals with them, and there is even talk of a Soviet-American partnership. It is no longer astonishing to suggest that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> seems closer to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in some ways than it does to <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. Two of the countries for which <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has felt the closest ideological kinship, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, are bleeding refugees at a rate that leaves defenders of the socialist faith groping for explanations. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s dilemma is that he ca n't start a Soviet-style reform process without robbing his own revolution of its identity. He has been determined from the outset to create a society that bears as little resemblance as possible to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He has associated the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with all of the evils of pre-revolutionary <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> society _ prostitution, gambling casinos, repressive military government, foreign domination, exploitative capitalism, unemployment, illiteracy and disease. But while eradicating the worst abuses of the past and eliminating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> influence almost completely, he has built a new society plagued by chronic shortages and showing little economic vitality. But if <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> adopted Soviet-style reforms, that would call into question the most basic premises of the revolution, one of which is that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with its disreputable value system and unquenchable expansionist tendencies, is on the losing side of history. He shows no sign of backtracking from that view. `` Will he change before he dies?'' asks <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> biographer <PERSON> Georgie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Geyer </PERSON>. `` No, he is an extraordinarily unified, stubborn man.'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, 63, seemed to confirm that view last January when he said: `` Socialism or death. Marxism-Leninism or death.'' He has not retreated from his position that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is in the vanguard of an international process, governed by irrevocable `` historical forces,'' that will end with the worldwide triumph of socialism. It is an increasingly lonely stand, shared by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and a small and diminishing number of others. `` No one, beyond perhaps <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, looks to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for political and economic leadership and inspiration,'' says <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton-Colby </PERSON>, who served during the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration as an expert on Latin American affairs. Far from mellowing as his revolution approaches middle age, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> stresses increased reliance on moral incentives, cracking down on ideological deviants and arresting human rights activists thought to be too irreverent in their criticism of the government. This past summer, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> even banned two Soviet Spanish language publications _ products of the glasnost era under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> _ which <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> felt were downright subversive. According to independent human rights groups, about 30 Cubans who spoke to delegates from a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> human rights panel that visited <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> last year are now in prison. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary of state for human rights, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON>, says that in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> there is `` complete intolerance for the slightest form of dissent.'' -LRB- <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> officials reply that it is safer to be a dissident in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> than in most Central American countries, where non-conformists risk being targeted by death squads, a phenomenon unknown in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. -RRB- 1989 also produced the biggest political scandal in the history of the revolution. In July, four high-level military and intelligence officers, including a highly decorated <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> hero, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, were executed for drug trafficking, corruption and `` betraying the revolution.'' Seven weeks later, a former interior minister, one of <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s closest confidants, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for abuse of office and other charges related to drug trafficking The cases shocked many Cubans, who had long been taught that high officials were models of revolutionary rectitude. Some analysts contend the crackdown was related less to a drive for law and order than to a move by <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> to eliminate possible rivals and reformers. A decade ago, the world seemed more congenial to <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. 1979 produced for <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> two new ideological allies in the hemisphere _ <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The ouster of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s military dictatorship in October of that year seemed to breathe new life into the leftist insurgency there. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration appeared overwhelmed by crises both foreign and domestic. In one unhappy four-week period, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies in three Islamic countries were assaulted by angry mobs.

 The administration seemed especially inept when it announced the `` discovery'' of a Soviet brigade in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, only to ruefully acknowledge later that it had been there all along. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s international reach extended well into <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where thousands of Cuban soldiers were deployed in support of pro-Soviet regimes in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. But, perhaps as a portent for the bleak decade that lay ahead for <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, just four days before the 1970s ended the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, creating an extremely uncomfortable situation for <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> in view of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s role as a founding member of the non-aligned movement. The invasion occurred less than four months after <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> was touting to the non-aligned summit in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was the `` natural ally'' of the movement. The overwhelming majority of the more than 100 members in the movement criticized the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> action when it came up in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, despite <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s role as chairman of the movement, consistently cast its vote with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Now even the Soviets themselves have repudiated the invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, calling it a `` most serious violation'' of Soviet norms. For <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, one of the most dispiriting events of the 1980s began less than 100 days after the decade began. In April, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> opened the port of <LOCATION> Mariel </LOCATION> to Cubans wishing to head north to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. For five months, wave upon wave of Cubans _ an average of almost 1,000 a day _ escaped the island on the Mariel `` freedom flotilla'' until <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> closed the port in September. The departure of that many Cubans left the impression among many that something was gravely wrong with the revolution. Other reverses were to come. The election of perhaps the most committed anti-Castro American president in the history of the revolution, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, meant no respite for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> as far as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was concerned. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> steadily tightened loopholes in the economic embargo against <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and also dealt setbacks to <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> in other ways. The Cuban-backed government in <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> was ousted by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion in 1983. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, meanwhile, was arming anti-communist insurgents in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and was sending large-scale military assistance to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to help counter Cuban-backed leftist guerrillas. The overall trend in the hemisphere was toward democracy, not violent revolution. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s high hopes of acquiring new allies in the hemisphere have been stalled. Not long after <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> assumed power, President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was worried that Cuban-style upheavals could erupt all over the hemisphere. As the 1980s end, says <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton-Colby </PERSON>, the `` growing rejection'' of the Cuban model even by the Latin American left is `` the single most startling change'' that has occurred in the hemisphere in 20 years. Domestically, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> can point to some successes, particularly in social services. There is quite possibly no leader anywhere who pays closer attention to meeting the health needs of his people than <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, and his efforts have produced impressive results. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> says its infant mortality rate is about a half to a third less than that of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The good health of Cubans is underscored by the unusually large number of world-class athletes the country continually produces. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> also is able to boast that virtually every school-age child has access to education. A child in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has a much better chance of becoming a healthy, productive adult in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> than, say, in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. If the revolution sometimes falls short in its promise of a job for everybody, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s employment rates certainly have been much higher than the typical Latin American country. But critics, such as Professor <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, maintain that the <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> inherited in 1959 was not a typical Latin American country. He claims <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> was the third-ranking developed country in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1959 and now ranks `` something like 16th or 18th'' because of Marxist economics. The undercurrent of dissatisfaction is obvious. For many, access to jobs, education and health care is not enough. There are powerful constraints on personal and political freedom, and life for many is a chore. Rationing imposes strict constraints on both diet and fashion, lines are long at stores and restaurants, commuting is a nightmare and recreational opportunities are scarce. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has acknowledged the existence of widespread corruption at government enterprises. He also complained about a tendency among Cubans not to give their best effort on the job or not to show up for work at all. Despite <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s exhortations, the work ethic among many Cubans is sadly lacking, partly a result of a system that provides only meager material rewards for a day's work. As many observers see it, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s vision of a nation populated by selfless workers who think only of the common good seems illusory. He once said he never visited a construction site without finding the workers taking a break. If <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s landslide re-election in 1984 was grim news for <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, there was an even more ominous development seven weeks after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s second inauguration. The death of <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON>, secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, did not seem to be a momentous event at the time. But the accession of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> not only transformed the face of <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> relations it also has raised questions for the first time about the durability of the once seemingly unshakable Soviet-Cuban alliance. Analysts wonder how long the Soviets will be willing to continue subsidizing the Cuban economy at the rate of more than $ 4 billion annually, particularly if the Soviets continue their policy of focusing increasingly on domestic problems while de-emphasizing international issues. As the Cuban troop commitment to pro-Soviet regimes in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> fades and <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> becomes less useful politically to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s compulsion to assist <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> economically presumably will fade with it. According to the current schedule, the last of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s troops will be leaving <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> early in 1991. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> can point to some achievements during the decade. The Cuban military presence in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was a major factor in bringing about the removal of South African forces from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and the breakthrough in 1988 toward independence in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Once feared as a promoter of violent revolution and scorned by his neighbors, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> now has normal diplomatic relations with most Latin American countries. Over the past year, he has attended presidential inaugurals in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> even received the support of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> objections, for one of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> seats reserved for that region and will begin a two-year stint on the council starting in January, a new role for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> as the next decade begins. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Falcoff </PERSON>, resident fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a research organization, says the new decade might produce for <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> a crisis of a different nature for his revolution. `` Without allies, without enemies, without an ` internationalist mission,' can <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> survive?'' <PERSON> Falcoff </PERSON> asks. `` This promises to be one of the really interesting questions for the next decade and beyond.''

 With a donated boat and an eighth-grade education, a third-generation fisherman tries to stem the decline of the waters that sustain him. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Backer </PERSON>, the first <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Soundkeeper, considers his work a legacy to his children.

 As the third generation of his family to earn a living from the rich shellfish beds of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Backer </PERSON> grew up well-versed in the language of the sea. As spoken by his father and grandfather, it was an ancient language, as timeless and salty as the currents and tides. In Backer's lifetime, that has changed. New words _ petroleum hydrocarbons, bacterial effluvium, polychlorinated biphenyls _ have seeped into the fisherman's vocabulary. `` As a child,'' says the 36-year-old Backer, `` I would yell at people not to throw things in the water. I've been hollering at my dad since I was 8 years old for throwing cigarette butts or soda cans overboard. It just struck me that they did n't belong. `` Dad would say, ` You ca n't compare a soda can to 300 million pounds of sewage.' The hell you ca n't. It's the exact same philosophy at work.'' If a man takes offense at a stray cigarette butt, how does he feel about PCBs in his bluefish? If he finds floating soda cans an affront, how does he cope with petroleum hydrocarbons? <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Backer </PERSON> has coped by learning a new language, peppered with such terms as `` fax machine,'' `` environmental litigation'' and `` regulatory process.'' The time once spent fishing for oysters and pulling lobster traps is now given to tracking polluters and battling developers. Evenings once devoted to family are taken up with a steady agenda of speaking engagements at civic clubs. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Backer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> fisherman, has become <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Backer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Soundkeeper </LOCATION>, an officious title for a $ 400-a-week job that carries no badge, no benefits and no illusions. `` I'm not naive enough to think that anything I do will have any immediate effect. It's a long-term thing. I do n't think I can change the world. But I do need to start. We're talking about the family farm.'' The `` farm'' is 1,300 square miles of water rimmed by 570 miles of coast, much of it gold, home to 5 million people. `` The population is constantly shifting to get closer to the shoreline,'' says <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON>, a Connecticut-based ecologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` Easily between 300 and 500 projects a year are proposed for Long Island Sound. Even in this glutted market, it's still the most desirable real estate in the world.'' The man who keeps watch has an eighth-grade education, a bad back, a wife, two young sons and a sense of urgency. He also has `` hands-on, feet-wet experience, and an intimate knowledge of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Sound,'' neither of which can be found in a textbook. `` Maybe the heart is more what this job needs than the book,'' Backer says. Maybe so, agreed the directors of the non-profit <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Soundkeepers Fund, who chose him over college-educated applicants. `` He knows more about the water than most marine biologists we deal with,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, clinical professor at <ORGANIZATION> Pace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> and supervising attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishermen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> knows when there's stuff missing. He has seen species disappear, acres of yield grass, smelt. He can say there used to be blue crabs here but there are n't any more. He has an institutional memory that goes back three generations.'' Unlike many fishermen, who've accepted the sound's decline and taken part-time jobs to supplement their income, `` <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s never accepted it,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> says. `` He feels for the resource. He loves it. And he's decided to make a stand and fight for it.'' Making a stand often means making enemies. Backer's been called everything from extortionist to ambulance-chaser by elected officials throughout the region. `` He goes into town board meetings where everybody hates him, the wealthiest people in these towns will be screaming at him, and he'll state his arguments and fight with them,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> says. `` Developers hate him because one of the big battles is against shoreline development that requires marinas; marinas require dredging, which <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> opposes. Municipalities hate him because he's sued every municipality from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The suits were brought during his tenure as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishermen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a group he co-founded to help fishermen deal with regulatory agencies and polluters. The Soundkeepers Fund was established with proceeds from the settlement of an association lawsuit against <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION> in 1986, when local oyster beds were closed due to sewage contamination. Publicity about contaminated shellfish beds `` is a double-edged sword,'' says <LOCATION> Stonington </LOCATION> fisherman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. `` On the one hand, we need municipal and federal agencies to take note.'' On the other hand, he says, such publicity causes sales to drop immediately, even though `` pollution in one place does n't mean contaminated shellfish all up and down the coast.'' Nonetheless, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> approves of Backer's work. `` <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s always working to improve the lot of fishermen. He goes to a lot of meetings, he speaks up, and he speaks for a lot of people.''

 Though he still manages to go oyster fishing, Backer's campaign on behalf of the sound is a seven-day-a-week job. `` It's the house I do n't own, the novel I did n't write. It's the legacy I will leave my children.'' He is thickset and stocky, with <PERSON> Popeye </PERSON> biceps, unanchored shirttail and a face that evokes a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> autumn: sky-blue eyes, wind-chapped skin and a chinful of reddish-gold scrub. A tiny gold anchor pierces one earlobe, and a faded denim cap stained with fish blood moors his hair. A self-described `` walking contradiction,'' he's a smoker who worries about air quality; a fisherman who frequents a seafood restaurant, then orders hot dogs for lunch. He's also a pollution fighter who objects to being called an environmentalist, `` a word that conjures up images of kooks in canoes, tree-huggers, liberals.'' He prefers `` fisherman,'' and when asked why, cites <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>: `` My God, it's a noble trade! It was the apostles' own calling.'' `` There is something noble about being a fisherman, about producing food for people to eat,'' Backer says. However, it was restlessness, not nobility, that led him to choose his father's lobster boat over a high school education. He also worked at a gas station, then set off at 16 to see the world. `` I picked crops in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, I logged in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. To give you an idea of the politicizing of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Backer </PERSON>, I once owned a T-shirt that said, ` <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>: Kiss My Ax.' There is some confusion in society about just what natural resources are for.'' The T-shirt is long gone, as is any confusion on its owner's part `` The Earth is for everyone,'' Backer says. `` I'm not against progress. But if progress means water you ca n't drink, plants you ca n't grow, fish you ca n't eat and air you ca n't breathe, we need to redefine progress.'' His effort on behalf of the sound began in earnest after a fishing trip to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> in the early'70s. `` It was very beautiful _ as pristine as you can get. Then I came back here to work with my father and one day, while looking over the side of the boat, I saw that the place had really gone downhill. There were rafts of human sewage floating downriver. `` Each generation leaves less behind. My grandfather did n't know it could all be consumed, that it could be possible to dig out all the marshes. How we got here is ignorance. How we stay here is arrogance.'' Backer's credentials as a fisherman help buttress his argument. `` He's not an ivory-tower environmentalist,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> says. `` He can be much more persuasive because he's able to say, ` I've got a family that may go hungry because you are discharging this stuff into <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> and I want you to stop.' Or, ` Because you are dredging this shoal for your pleasure boat, I'm going to lose income this year.''' `` The idea that environmentalists take jobs away from people is still very prevalent,'' Backer says. `` We've become supermarketized. Clean water and the first 6 inches of soil are what keep us all going. `` People say that you ca n't compare worms and clams with people. What I'm trying to tell them is that when the worms and the clams go, we are not far behind.'' He uses a donated 19-foot powerboat to look for things that do n't belong: dead fish, raw sewage, detergent foam, spewing pipes. The boat is small for a reason. `` Most of the problems are right around the edges,'' in shallow water. With 86 sewage treatment plants all emptying into the sound, there's always something to find. On this particular Sunday _ `` Sundays are good days to catch people doing things they should n't be doing'' _ he finds a solvent leaving a sheen on the surface of the <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Backer frowns at the sight of a hen mallard dipping her bill into a tiny oil slick, then follows the trail until the river narrows, forcing him to turn back. He'll cover the rest of the distance on foot. `` When I find something in the water, that's when the real work begins.'' Tracking the culprit could take weeks. Much of the work is done in the office, the second floor of an aging clapboard house overlooking an inlet. A hand-lettered sign over the door says `` War Room.'' `` It's considered good form for people involved in causes to say things like, ` There are no enemies here,''' Backer says. `` But there is an enemy. The enemy is people, companies, municipalities. Whoever puts that dollar ahead of the environment that's going to sustain my kids, you're my enemy.'' Far more battles take place in the hearing room than the courtroom. `` Every problem does n't need to be addressed with a lawsuit,'' Backer says. `` If I can go to a community and talk to people, write letters, or show up and do interviews with the local newspapers, a lot of times that's all it takes to get people thinking differently. `` Government works best when people participate. Without citizen input, the guys in the $ 800 suits are going to get what they want for the people they work for.'' Though the battles continue, <PERSON> Backer </PERSON> believes he and the sound already have won the war. `` What we've won is an awareness around the area that someone is here, and someone is watching.''

 Isle Royale is a fascinating natural phenomenon that has beckoned Indians before the birth of Christ and archaeologists and biologists in modern times. The Indians mined natural copper from the island. The scientists used it as an insulated laboratory to study animal behavior. But now there is trouble. One link in the balance of nature, the wolf, is dying out.

 For 40 years, the wolves and moose of <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Royale </LOCATION> have engaged in a macabre dance of predator and prey before a fascinated audience of scientists and summer campers. This island has been the site of one of the world's most intense wildlife studies, neatly confined to an 8 - by 45-mile laboratory isolated in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION> Now the wolves are dying. No one knows why. Dr. <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, who for the past 19 years has been chief researcher for the 31-year-old Isle Royale Project, fears there will soon be a winter when he can not find a single wolf on the island, where more than 50 roamed a few years ago. Until 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> dictated a policy of non-interference with the wolves. While researchers elsewhere captured the animals for blood tests and to attach radio collars, on Isle Royale scientists learned what they could from aerial surveys and by examining moose carcasses. Nobody under any circumstances touched a wolf. `` This was one of the last really unmanipulated wolf populations in the world,'' former park superintendent <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON> said from his office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where he is now is chief of operations for the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` These wolves were really a museum test specimen of wolves in the wild.'' Despite <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON>'s objections, the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> last year gave <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> permission to collar the island's dwindling wolves. `` The line was crossed. Now we can never say these wolves have never been touched by man,'' said Assistant Park Superintendent <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferranti </PERSON> on the island. `` Isle Royale is different for me now. I feel a loss just knowing that.'' Isle Royale is a rugged collection of high ridges plunging into tangled swamps, a serrated edge of the earth rising out of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION>, 18 miles from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the nearest mainland. The Indians called it Minong and traveled across open lake in canoes to pry copper from the island's crevices. Today backpackers alight from ferry boats. Isle Royale is teeming with moose, more than 1,600 at last count. They were a waiting food supply when wolves from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> loped across the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION> ice in what must have been 1949, the winter the lake froze. They arrived unseen, nine years after the island became a national park. Former park ranger <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakala </PERSON> first confirmed there were wolves on Isle Royale. It was November 1951. He and his wife were taking one last hike up <LOCATION> Feldtmann </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> before snow closed the island and sent them retreating to the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> mainland. In that first frost of winter, he saw wolf tracks. <PERSON> Hakala </PERSON> also remembers the mournful sounds that came later. `` You figure you're hearing the call of the wild when you hear that howl,'' he says. `` It has that sad quality.'' That did n't stop a public relations campaign the next year to stock Isle Royale with four wolves from a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> zoo. The pack tore a housewife's laundry into strips, ate a fisherman's nets and then stalked a tourist. Rangers shot two of them and deported a third. The fourth, a black creature called <PERSON> Big </PERSON> <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, escaped and disappeared into island folklore. In 1958, Dr. <PERSON> Durward </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> arrived with his doctoral candidates to begin one of the world's precursor studies of wolf predation. There was precious little known about the wolf and its prey. Thirty-one years of research since then have told science much about the way wolves live, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> says.

 `` These life communities are the most complex things we know about in the whole universe,'' he said. `` We are only beginning to unravel it.'' When <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> stepped in, he inherited a stable pack of about two dozen wolves and a celebrated study that mapped the harmony of nature. Something snapped the balance. The population exploded. By 1980, <PERSON> Isle </PERSON> <PERSON> Royale </PERSON> had three wolf packs and 50 wolves. It was the highest density of wolves recorded in the world. Just as suddenly, the wolves began dying. In 1981, 30 wolves survived the winter. In 1982, the population was 14. In those two years, counting new generations born and lost, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> figured 52 wolves died. He found six carcasses and no conclusions. The survivors roamed at a nervous pace. Evidence suggested the wolves were killing each other. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> did n't think it was anything more than an ordinary population swing for several more years. But the wolves failed to make the comeback he hypothesized. By 1988 there were just 12 animals left and the pups born each year were too few to replace the dying elders. He persuaded the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to let him capture <PERSON> Isle </PERSON> <PERSON> Royale </PERSON>'s wolves and take action. Blood samples taken from four of the animals last year showed three were exposed to Lyme disease, transmitted by infected ticks and suspected of causing reproductive failure in wolves. The blood also showed two wolves were exposed to canine parvovirus, a fatal disease of domestic dogs. No dogs are allowed on Isle Royale but the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> suspects boaters sneak their pets ashore. A third test showed the four wolves had look-alike genes, in keeping with the theory the whole population comes from a single female who colonized the island 40 years ago. Island inbreeding could mean reduced fertility and the doom of the population. It would not cause a population crash, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> thinks. `` The big unknown is, did disease cause the crash? Very likely it did and we will never know,'' he said. The only theory <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> can write off is starvation. There is plenty of food. A faint odor wafted on the lake breeze when he returned to the island last spring after a winter of teaching at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houghton </LOCATION>. Carcasses of winter-starved moose rotted in the warm air. Over the next few weeks, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>'s field assistants found dozens of dead moose, their legs tucked beneath them where they died in the snow. There were more weak moose than wolves could kill, more carcasses than wolves could scavenge. Meanwhile, the island's wolf population dropped to 11. The Park Service has not decided what to do. One proposal is to simply let the wolves die without human intervention. But Isle Royale without wolves could mean more moose, more starved moose. `` My own advice is just reintroduce wolves,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> says. `` Get with the program.'' This summer, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> watched in frustration as the remaining wolves abandoned their traditional rendezvous sites. There was no cohesive pack, no evidence of denning, no promise of pups. Where were the animals? `` I have n't the foggiest,'' he said from the fisherman's cabin where he keeps a graveyard of moose skeletons out back and writes a eulogy for wolves within. Then unexpectedly in September, field assistant <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurber </PERSON> saw something hopeful. She saw wolf pup tracks in the earth.

 Coal has long been one of <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>'s most valuable natural resources. But there's something else in those hills that's coming into strong demand even as the coal industry flounders. Water. Pure mountain mineral water. Bottled water has become the fastest-growing segment of the beverage business.

 From smart shops in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to the White House dinner table, water from the mineral springs of <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> suddenly has cachet, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> bottlers are helping quench the thirst of the health-conscious. Water straight out of these hills is just plain good and good for you, they say. `` Out West, they look at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> as a wild, untouched area,'' says <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Greider </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Quibell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, bottler of the state's best-known mineral water. `` They are n't concerned with pollution from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> We find that to be a good selling factor.'' <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillion </PERSON>, co-owner of the smaller <ORGANIZATION> Nu-Mint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Springs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lindside </LOCATION>, agrees. `` A lot of people in other states and different cities like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> think <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> is wilderness,'' she says. <PERSON> Geary </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottled </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, says the $ 2 billion industry has grown dramatically in recent years. `` We've seen over the past decade a growth of up to 500 percent in sales,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> says. `` In 1988 alone, the bottled water market grew by 14.9 percent in terms of sales, which was an increase over all other beverage segments.'' By far the most successful operation has been in rural <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, about 140 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, where Quibell captures 12,000 gallons of mineral water daily and trucks it 40 miles over <LOCATION> Peters </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. It is bottled and shipped in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Greider </PERSON>'s company has increased its profits by 250 percent since August 1987 and has more than 200 distributors across the nation. The executive says bottled water is becoming more popular because it's no longer a drink for just the well-to-do. `` People are concerned with what they consume. We're finding that mineral water is becoming more mainstream to the American public,'' <PERSON> Greider </PERSON> says. `` It's the fastest growing segment in the beverage industry.'' Quibell, which is sold throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mineral water to be exported and can be found on store shelves in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Mineral water from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> is even served to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his guests, says <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Freemyer </PERSON>, an assistant usher at the White House. There are eight companies in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> bottling water and officials say that number will grow. `` I certainly think it has a potential of becoming a fairly sizable industry that could greatly contribute to the state economy,'' says <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Forren </PERSON>, director of the state's public health and sanitation division, which oversees the bottling of mineral water. <LOCATION> Nu-Mint </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> is the latest <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> company to get into the market, spending $ 400,000 for a water bottling plant in southwestern <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` It's going to pay off. This business is real profitable,'' <PERSON> McMillion </PERSON> says. `` It's providing jobs in the area. It's giving us some self-esteem and southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> needs self-esteem.'' <PERSON> Forren </PERSON> says <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s large number of springs and heavy concentration of limestone makes it a natural for producing mineral water. `` The minerals in the springs and the bacteriological quality of the water apparently make it just a good, sweet-tasting water that individuals like,'' he says. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> extension agent, says many of the hundreds of springs located in his county have high-quality water. `` We have tested the water and you can almost advertise that it has zero percent sodium, it's that low,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> says. `` The good things that water should have, it has in it.'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lead the nation in bottled water consumption, averaging 19 gallons per capita per year, while the national consumption rate is 6.4 gallons. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Deal </PERSON>, executive vice president of the bottled water association, says production rankings for each state are n't available `` Right now it is still mainly regional, but certainly _ especially in the sparkling category _ more products are being marketed nationally because they are primarily an alternative to soft drinks and alcohol,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> says.

 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s growing numbers of homeless people have problems more complex than the hobos of yesteryear. No longer will just a meal and a bed get the job done, says one innovative shelter director. The answer? In <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, it's computers to the rescue.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>, the oldest relief agency in the city, is n't interested in just feeding, clothing and saving the souls of the down-and-out. It wants them to read, write and understand computers, too. red-brick building with the blue `` Jesus Saves'' sign over the door, director <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxfield </PERSON> is trying to redefine the goals of a shelter for t Inside thehe homeless as well as the needs of the men who seek help there. The latest innovation is a computer-based program for functionally illiterate adults. It is part of `` a new sophistication of the old urban missions'' in response to changes in the makeup of the growing homeless population in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Maxfield </PERSON> says. In the past, he says, shelters were thought to be doing their job by providing a roof, a prayer and a meal for hobos and alcoholics. The new homhelter's board chairman, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, a retired schoolteacher, and other volunteer educators began a tutoring program to help the shelter's wards earn high school equivalency diplomas. Then, a year ago, <PERSON> Maxfield </PERSON> visited <ORGANIZATION> Accelerated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to take a look at its computer-oriented education courses for schools. He worked with ACE to develop similar programs for adults, from the illiterate to those in need of refresher courses. The resulting program began at the mission a few months ago. The literacy and other programs are financed entirely by donations, <PERSON> Maxfield </PERSON> says. In 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> reported revenues of $ 717,000, all of it from donations and interest. The shelter probably has invested at least $ 6,000 so far in the literacy program, <PERSON> Maxfield </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Maxfield </PERSON> believes in taking the mission to the streets as well, where the homeless live. He says many can not leave their camps in railroad yards or under viaducts because they are afraid of being robbed. This does n't faze <PERSON> Maxfield </PERSON>. He says he developed street smarts at a previous job as chaplain in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail system. The mission also has a truck that collects leftover food from Denver-area supermarkets and drops it off in poor neighborhoods. And it has a farm in northern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> where interested shelter residents can get away from city pressures and help grow food for the shelter. Now <PERSON> Maxfield </PERSON> is expanding the mission to include a shelter and vocational training center for women in a building being renovated nearby. It is scheduled to open in January. <PERSON> Maxfield </PERSON> hopes the computers ultimately will be used not only for educational and vocational training but for personal development. Such as? `` How to balance a checkbook,'' he said.

 In the Old West the fight was between the cattlemen and the homesteaders, barbed wire vs. open range. In today's West the terms are different, but the fight has a similar ring. It pits developers with promises of riches against those who chose to be there because they like it the way it is.

 Plans for a giant ski resort in this pristine corner of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> near the Canadian border have divided the local residents as decidedly as the <LOCATION> Methow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> bisects the magnificent valley. The conflict is not new in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It involves 1,200 jobs and economic growth for a depressed rural county on the one hand, and a radically altered lifestyle for the <LOCATION> Methow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> on the other. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision this summer helped pave the way for construction of the $ 280 million Early Winters ski resort. There are still formidable environmental obstacles before construction can begin, but the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision is the biggest hurdle that the developers, <ORGANIZATION> Methow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, have crossed. That has brought the 3,600-acre resort much closer to reality. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lacks a major destination ski resort on the order of <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION> or Big Sky, and state officials have supported the project as a way to keep ski dollars at home. `` There is n't a ski hill where you can stay with your family for a week,'' says <PERSON> Cal </PERSON> <PERSON> Merriman </PERSON>, owner of the 20-room <ORGANIZATION> Mazama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION> in the shadow of 6,088-foot <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Butte </PERSON>. Like other area business owners, <PERSON> Merriman </PERSON> expects the resort business to spill over to his operation. But he is also aware of the changes it would bring. A resort with accommodations for 7,000 would be a small city, and would require services such as grocery stores, sewer systems and streets, he says. `` The social structure of the valley would change.'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, an employee of Winthrop Mountain Sports, feels the resort would give young people like herself more incentive to stay. `` A lot of kids who graduate leave the valley,'' she says. `` People do n't make much money.'' <LOCATION> Okanogan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials and many <LOCATION> Methow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> business people are enthusiastic about increased tax and retail revenues, since the resort would be one of the biggest employers in the sparsely populated county of 30,000 residents. But there is little doubt a resort the magnitude of Early Winters would significantly change the region. Home to just 3,600 full-time residents, the valley's depressed economy depends on tourism, logging and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Work is seasonal, wages are low and there is widespread unemployment in the winter. `` Last summer I hired 10 people and kept two on in the winter,'' says <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Tenderfoot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a general store in <LOCATION> Winthrop </LOCATION>. `` There is 80 percent unemployment in the winter.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> supports the resort, as do many business owners along <PERSON> Winthrop </PERSON>'s Old West-style main street. Just 15 miles west of <LOCATION> Winthrop </LOCATION>, which has 400 year-round residents, the resort would likely be a major boost to an area that currently thrives only during the summer travel season through nearby North Cascades National Park. But the area is also home to an independent collection of residents who came to escape urban pressures and are ekeing out a living. To them, the remoteness and lack of opportunity are a challenge. `` One reason people move to the <LOCATION> Methow </LOCATION> is it's really hard to get by here,'' says <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Spohn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Twisp </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Methow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an environmental group that challenged the resort in court. `` A lot of us could make lots more money in the city,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Spohn </PERSON>, who commutes 100 miles a day to teach special education in <LOCATION> Brewster </LOCATION>. `` We decided to make less money and live in a place we like.'' In addition to the evergreens, the wildflowers and the burbling streams, the <LOCATION> Methow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> is wonderfully quirky. Hotels in <LOCATION> Winthrop </LOCATION> lack television sets and telephones, two modern conveniences much desired by visitors. Area bookstores are heavily stocked with the classics. The Confluence Gallery in nearby <LOCATION> Twisp </LOCATION> -LRB- pop. 800 -RRB- is currently showing the ceramics and tapestries of <PERSON> Zeljko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kujundzic </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Twisp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pastries </ORGANIZATION> and Savories cafe next door serves wonderful scones and strawberry muffins. The local theater group is putting on `` Oklahoma!'' `` There is a lot of cultural diversity,'' says <PERSON> Pema </PERSON> <PERSON> Choki </PERSON>, an organic herb farmer who also waits tables at the cafe. Like other resort opponents, Ms. <PERSON> Choki </PERSON> is concerned the resort will ruin air and water quality, wildlife habitat and the pastoral lifestyle of the valley. In the planning for two decades, Early Winters would transform <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Butte </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Okanogan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> into a downhill ski area, averaging 3,500 skiers a day, and at the bottom a golf course and resort village with overnight accommodations for 7,000. It would easily be the largest community and largest job generator in the valley. The <ORGANIZATION> Methow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a grass-roots organization, sued in 1985. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, but the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reinstated it, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> had to come up with detailed measures to protect the valley's air quality, mule deer herd and other environmental aspects. But the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled on May 1 that additional environmental impact studies were not required for the resort. Despite the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> victory, the developers still need to obtain state permits and complete supplemental environmental impact statements on issues not covered by the high court. Still, developers have said they hope to begin construction next year.

 <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> says it was a `` hoot'' to return to the theater of her childhood for her third special musical appearance with <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>. The first was at <LOCATION> Carnegie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1962, the second at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in 1971. `` <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>: Together Again,'' which <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> will televise on Wednesday, took them to the Pantages Theater in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. `` That's four blocks from where I was raised,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> says. `` My grandmother and I occasionally went to movies at the Pantages. It was still a movie theater then. They had a lot of premieres there and I can remember standing behind the ropes and watching the stars come in. So, it was a hoot to be on that stage.'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> do a series of skits and songs for the one-hour special. `` <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> and I, of all people, do a rap,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> says. `` I fell down when she suggested it. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitzie </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> wrote the rap song for us. It's called ` Mama's All Right' and it's us complaining about the way adults are treated by teen-agers, usually their own children. `` For <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> and I to do a rap was silly. Backstage, we called ourselves ` White Bread and Mayonnaise.''' They also do a send-up of `` The Phantom of the Opera.'' It's called `` Phantom of the Opry'' and it's done as a country-western number `` <PERSON> Julie </PERSON>'s a singer with hair as long as <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON>'s,'' she says. `` I'm an evil country-western singer with a twin sister banished to the catacombs of the Opry. She's the phantom and wants to make <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> the star.'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> is interviewed in her third-floor production office at the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>, where she is making her new series for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` <ORGANIZATION> Carol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Company.'' She points out the window to <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the current week's guest star, taking her lunch break outside. On one wall of the office is a large oil painting of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> as it might have appeared in the 1940s. She had the painting done by <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. She puts a finger on one building and says, `` That's the building where I lived with my grandmother. My friend <PERSON> Ilomae </PERSON> and I would go on the roof and shout down the air shaft. People would yell back, ` You girls get out of there and stop that noise.''' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> has written of her early experiences in `` One More Time.'' Her new show for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> probably will make its debut in the spring. It will be her first regular television appearance in some time. She made her TV debut as <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON>'s girlfriend on `` Stanley'' in 1956-57. The following year she was on `` Pantomime Quiz,'' then spent three years on `` The <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show,'' beginning in 1959. She co-starred on `` The Entertainers'' in 1964-65. `` The <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> Show'' ran on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> from 1967 to 1978 and four new shows were televised the following summer on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. She made occasional appearances on `` Mama's Family,'' a spinoff of the show. Since then she has starred in such feature films as `` A Wedding,'' `` Health,'' `` The Four Seasons'' and `` Annie'' and such TV movies as `` Friendly Fire,'' `` The Tenth Month,'' `` Between Friends'' and `` The Laundromat.'' `` <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> and I met in 1960 when she came backstage to see me when I was doing ` Once Upon a Mattress,''' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> says. `` A mutual friend had said we'd like each other and that usually puts you off. We hit it off. We performed together on ` The <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show' and we worked so well together the idea was born that we should do a special. `` It was a hard sell at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. I was a second banana on <PERSON> Garry </PERSON>'s show <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> was in ` Camelot' and nobody west of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> knew who she was. She had n't done ` <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Poppins </PERSON>' yet. We finally got it on and the show won an Emmy and the Golden Rose Award at the Montreux Film Festival.'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> have never done a movie together, although they've talked about it. Her new series, `` <ORGANIZATION> Carol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Company,'' is a comedy anthology conceived by <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, creator of `` Roseanne.'' The half-hour episodes feature different characters each week and such guest stars as <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nell </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillaume </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandel </PERSON>. `` The appeal to me was doing different characters,'' she says. `` I ca n't think of any character I'd want to do every week. A few years ago I thought of doing something like this. Then after <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> signed <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> they called me to meet <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>. He had this idea; I liked him, and what the heck. `` We do this before an audience, like variety, but it's much harder. For me, anyway. On a variety show a sketch ran only seven or eight minutes. If it did n't go over we could redeem ourselves with a song or another sketch. This time it's the entire show.''

 <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, who has finally won critical acclaim in <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> McNally </PERSON>'s off-Broadway hit, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Lisbon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traviata </ORGANIZATION>,'' knows the pitfalls and pratfalls of an actor's struggle upward. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> thought his breakthrough into public recognition would come with the play `` The <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>,'' in which he played the lead, a teacher in a private school in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

He did dinner theater and summer stock. `` Eventually I moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and starved,'' he says. `` I did singing telegrams, sold TV Guide and cookbooks by phone, did telephone polls. I called wheat farmers about what insecticide they were using.'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> did stand-up comedy with a partner. He was in `` One of the Boys,'' a TV series that shot only 13 episodes, then got an audition in 1982 for <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coward </PERSON>'s `` Present Laughter'' directed by and starring <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. `` It was the easiest audition I ever did,'' he says. `` Two days later they called and said, ` You got it.' I thought they'd get somebody more established in the theater. It was my Broadway debut. `` No show since has gone as easily. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> was such a gentleman, so great to me, like a father. If he'd asked me to jump off the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, I would have.'' Asked whether scripts are pouring in now that `` The <ORGANIZATION> Lisbon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traviata </ORGANIZATION>'' is a success, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> says no, then amends it to, `` One poured in today.'' Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillinger </PERSON>, who had directed <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> here in 1988 in `` The Film Society,'' suggested he be auditioned for the role of <PERSON> Mendy </PERSON> in `` The <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Traviata </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, who considers himself a character actor not a comedian, says: `` I love working with <PERSON> John </PERSON>. He's the first director in a long time who thought of me in terms of more than just comedy.'' Some people go to see `` The <ORGANIZATION> Lisbon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traviata </ORGANIZATION>'' without knowing whether it's a comedy, tragedy, musical or drama, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> says. `` It's a successful play,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> says. `` If they are n't familiar with the world they're going to enter, they're in for a big surprise. The opera jokes are self-explanatory. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> says, ` <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> sings like a truck driver.' I say, ` <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> IS a truck driver. She was discovered driving a fork lift in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> gravel pit.' `` And after the initial realization that all the characters are gay, the play becomes very universal. `` Slowly you realize it is about the fear of getting older and of being alone and feeling so desperate about that you'd rather kill your lover than let him leave you. `` I think it's a brave play, because it deliberately turns dark in the second act,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> says. `` By the end of the first act, you see the darkness coming and the pain an sadness that is there, if you're really paying attention. Some people feel cheated; they thought it was just going to be laughs. `` People have walked out. It gets very frank. The moment of nudity is not gratuitous. For <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> to go home and see a nude, young man there is meant to be shocking.'' Older men and women whom one would expect to be put off by the sexual frankness seem to respond to the play more than anyone, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> says. One older man told him: `` This was an old-fashioned drama told in a whole new way. This is the most moving experience I've had in the theater in 20 years.

<HEAD>At the Movies: `True Love'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 While big-buck movies crowd into the nation's theaters during the holiday season, a number of smaller, worthy films face the danger of being pushed out of the marketplace. Among them: `` <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> V </PERSON>,'' a daring new version by <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Brannagh </PERSON>; `` Staying Together,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s warm study of a small town family in trouble; `` My Left Foot,'' an inspiring tale of human survival with an electrifying performance by <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON>; `` Drugstore Cowboy,'' grownup <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> in a highly original film about druggies in 1970 <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. Add to the list `` True Love. Amazingly, it was filmed for less than $ 1 million. But `` True Love'' has far more heart and humanity than today's bloated sequels and star ego trips _ notably the noxious `` <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> Nights.'' The movie contains no recognizable names or faces. Nor does it boast a high concept plot. Its fascination lies in its high-spirited acting and verisimilitude to Italian-American life in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>. Director <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Savoca </PERSON> and her husband and co-producer, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Guay </PERSON>, have written a script centering on the rituals of a traditional wedding. The bride -LRB- <LOCATION> Annabella </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sciorra </LOCATION> -RRB- frets over why she is marrying <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldard </PERSON> -RRB-. He is unreliable, immature and selfish. His qualms are just as severe. He enjoys his life of freedom, of being able to hang out with the boys whenever he wants. Why take on the hassle and responsibility of marriage? Their doubts and fears continue right up to the wedding night, which he wants to spend with his chums. It's hard to imagine anything so dumb, but that's about the only disparity in the film. As a director-writer, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Savoca </PERSON> has a marvelous eye for detail and human touches. The interplay among the males and especially among the females -LRB- Are women so profane among themselves? -RRB- is carefully drawn and exploited for all its humor. She also makes her actors look as if they were n't acting. Both <PERSON> Sciorra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eldard </PERSON> show sparks of star quality. `` True Love'' is getting a desultory release by <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> and deserves time to find its audience. Rated R for language. Running time: 1 hour, 4 minutes.

Oboe, clarinet or violin often sings the melody over the usual bouncing accompanying figures. The score has moments of highly charged drama, and the orchestration is always superb. <PERSON> Chailly </PERSON> induces this somewhat rough-edged orchestra to give rhythmically taut, high-spirited and at times exciting performances. The band has its high spots, but an unfortunate number of low ones _ bad intonation in the brass, blurry strings and loose-knit pizzicati. The pieces are drawn from `` Macbeth,'' `` I vespri <PERSON> Siciliani </PERSON>,'' `` <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON>,'' `` Aida'' and `` Otello.'' _ By <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` We Too Are One'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Arista </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Eurythmics Once the darlings of post-modern, synth-pop enthusiasts, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennox </PERSON> have at last begun to speak to all of us. Their hard-edged `` We Too Are One'' builds on a more guitar-heavy rhythm and blues sound and sticks with lyrics rooted in a strong sense of self-worth. <PERSON> Lennox </PERSON> plays the jilted woman in the powerful lead single `` Do n't Ask Me Why,'' and the brutal `` You Hurt Me -LRB- And I Hate You -RRB-.'' She sounds nasty and unforgiving, but only because a man pushed her too far and she knows she's too good for that. In the sharply critical `` The King and Queen of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lennox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> comment on arrogant, phony political figures who exploit people with empty promises, people who `` never did anything _ to make ourselves feel proud.'' The real highlights on `` We Too Are One'' come in its ballads. <PERSON> Lennox </PERSON> laments the death of her father and grieves over her recent miscarriage in `` Angel,'' a poignant comment on the sadness of death and the hope of a better life in the netherworld. The hymn-like `` When the Day Goes Down'' is dedicated to the less fortunate and downtrodden, telling them, `` all God's children are beautiful and pure _ and you're as good as all of them.'' <PERSON> Lennox </PERSON>'s rich alto caresses the words, lending them a genuine sincerity, as <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>'s guitar weaves a gentle background. Nowadays, <PERSON> Lennox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> write songs that are modern without being threatening. `` We Too Are One'' seems more listener-friendly than some of their previous eight albums. It wo n't scare away aficionados of other types of music. Quite an accomplishment. By <PERSON> Kira </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Billik </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

<HEAD>Star Watch: The Season of Olympia Dukakis</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This seems to be the season of the <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Film Festival, since the Academy Award winner is simultaneously appearing in three major productions. `` It seems that way,'' she comments with a throaty laugh, `` but actually, it's a coincidence. These films, which have been done over the past 2 -LCB- years, just happened to be coming out at the same time.'' They are: `` Look Who's Talking,'' as the nagging mother of <LOCATION> Kirstie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alley </LOCATION>; `` Steel Magnolias,'' as a sardonic widow in the small-town comedy drama crowded with stars; and `` Dad,'' as the overbearing wife of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> and mother of <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Danson </PERSON>. The trio may seem like a bountiful harvest from her warmly applauded win of the supporting actress Oscar for `` Moonstruck'' earlier this year. But all were in the works before that happy event. The actress was here for `` Steel Magnolia'' festivities, and she appears in an interview as she does on the screen: warm, worldly wise and intelligent. The Oscar seems to have changed her not at all. She's still the same <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> who did such a fine selling job as <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> in the spaghetti sauce commercials. `` Steel Magnolias'' threw six volatile actresses together in a small Southern town, a potentially explosive situation. But <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> said she and her co-stars _ <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dolly </PERSON> <PERSON> Parton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>, <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> _ had a ball. `` Sometimes it was very raucous, and lewd and lascivious,'' she chuckled. `` We had a lot of fun together, bawdy. At other times it was very reflective, philosophical. We discussed life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. `` It was really a very nice time of coming together, the best of what happens when women are together. Strongly supportive and conciliatory, nurturing, caring. `` No temperament. Everyone seemed to like their characters a lot. You felt that everyone around you was really on target.'' It was different on `` Moonstruck,'' she reflected, recalling when two of the actors had a blowup and in the scuffle she had coffee spilled on her. But she agreed the incident might have derived from the Italian nature of the movie. In `` Steel Magnolias,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was able to play her own age, meaning 50ish. For `` Dad'' she had to endure two hours in the makeup chair as latex was applied to age her 15 to 20 years. `` The makeup helped to assume the age,'' she said. `` Also the clothes were specifically and carefully worked out. The length of the sleeves, the pants so that the bones showed, the hump in the back, the jewels oversized, the pocketbook a little too big. There was a kind of physical tightness about her that matched her feelings.'' Her opinion of <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON>: `` A very serious actor. I say that because having seen him in movies being so funny and carefree and bouncing off walls, then to meet him and see how seriously he takes his work. ... It's not that he did n't joke and kid off the set. But he was very concentrated on his work.'' The actress was as surprised as anyone when `` Look Who's Talking'' went through the roof -LRB- No 1 at the box office five weeks in a row, $ 85 million in 38 days -RRB-. `` I'm so happy for -LRB- director -RRB- <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckerling </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Kirstie </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Travolta </PERSON> -RRB-,'' she said. `` I have to admit that I never thought it would have this kind of popularity. I thought it was well done, and <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckerling </PERSON> has a nice way with actors. There was a nice feeling on the set, a kind of freedom to work and move around. At the same time you feel she sets boundaries. So it's a nice working situation.'' <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a late starter in the business. Born to Greek-born parents in <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, she grew up in the same political ferment that produced her cousin, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor and presidential candidate. After graduating from <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, she worked as a physical therapist, then returned to college to study theater arts. She worked in a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> regional theater, then moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at the age of 29 with her actor-husband <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorich </PERSON>. She taught at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> while playing in soap operas and off-Broadway. This might have been the story of her career except for a series of events that started six years ago. `` I did a <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Durang </PERSON> play, ` The Marriage of <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> and Boo,' that <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Ephron </PERSON> saw,'' the actress related. `` She recommended me to <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> for ` Heartburn.' I played Meryl Streep's mother and was eventually cut out of the film. He cast me in the play ` Social Security,' which ran for quite a while. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewison </PERSON> saw me in that and put me in ` Moonstruck.''' And what has been the result of her Oscar win? `` We no longer have a mortgage,'' she said with a laugh. She and her husband live in 100-year-old house in <LOCATION> Montclair </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>.

Yes, both a hero and a friend, says <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON> about the late <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON>, chief concert technician at <ORGANIZATION> Steinway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sons, accompanied the pianist to performances that included his heralded comeback at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> in 1965, his 1986 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> concert and two appearances at the White House. He last saw <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> four days before he died, during a Wednesday session for a new recording at <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> home. When <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON> arrived Friday for another session, he was told that <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> had practiced for half an hour but did n't feel well. The pianist died suddenly Nov. 5 while discussing with his wife, <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON>, a menu for that night's dinner to which they had invited pianist <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Perahia </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> was in a class by himself,'' <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON> said. `` He had tremendous command when it comes to technique. Many young artists have technique today, too. But nobody has such a wide range of color like <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>. He had from a super-fortissimo to a super-pianissimo so soft it hardly exists. When he played his last European tour, in 1987, he played <PERSON> Liszt </PERSON>'s ` Consolation' with such command it made you cry. `` He played dangerously in a way, in his phrasing and his tempos, almost many times to the breaking point but never over it. He had such clarity. In fast passages you heard every note. Many pianists smear through. Even now, at 86 ... he was tremendous. Listen to his last record, ` <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> at Home.' Unbelievable.'' They were friends, too, <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON> said. `` Many times I'm invited for dinner after a concert. We had the <ORGANIZATION> Horowitzes </ORGANIZATION> for dinner at our home. They appreciated my family very much. I have two boys in the piano business, in leading positions I would say. My daughter is getting married in February. <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> said they would come. `` <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> was the best critic for him. He listened to her. She is profound and knows music. My wife and I love her, too.'' <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>'s own piano, a wedding gift when he married <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Toscanini </PERSON> in 1933, was moved from his home to the basement of the Steinway showroom three years ago. His last recording was done on a new piano from Steinway. Gesturing to <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>'s piano, which he always took with him on tours, <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON> said: `` He was planning to take this piano again on tour. I prepared it for him. He was coming in this week to look at it. He said soon he would play in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, maybe <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>.'' Asked whether <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> was even-tempered or volatile, <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON> said: `` I would say that being such a genius, as he really was, a man of his caliber would change emotionally hour by hour. You see it in his playing. He never played the same piece the same way. `` Of course he could blow up or get excited on the spur of a moment that some little thing is not just right. That can happen but it is understandable. `` For a technician, he was very easy to work with, because he was consistent in what he did. He always had his rehearsal at 4 p.m. Saturday and his concert at 4 Sunday. He never practiced the day of the concert. He said if he did n't know the piece the day before, he should n't play it.'' <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON> has traveled with pianists, some of them famous, who played every day, on whatever piano was available and often practiced so close to the time of the concert that he had no time to prepare the piano. `` Tuning is extremely important,'' he said. `` An action has more than 10,000 parts, consisting of wood and felt, therefore subject to changes in humidity. You have constantly to check the regulation of the instrument, especially a piano which travels. In <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> I had two sets of tools with me, plus quite a few parts, like strings.'' <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON> is nervous only for the first few bars. Then, when he hears the piano sounding all right, he relaxes and enjoys the music. He started his music career in performance, studying violin in his native <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` I had problems with my left wrist. I came to the painful conclusion I could n't pursue a musical career. I was already 22 when I went into this -LRB- tuning -RRB-. I worked my way through the factory.'' Some technicians shrink from contact with musicians but <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON> relishes it. <PERSON> Steinway </PERSON> moved him to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1962. `` My predecessor was <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hupfer </PERSON>. He was a legend. He had traveled all his life with <PERSON> Rachmaninoff </PERSON>. When he retired, I took over as chief concert technician.'' <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON> recalled one <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> incident with a smile: `` He made me pretty famous. When he played in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, it was a tremendous success. I came home on Monday. He called me, ` You have to come back. I play a second concert.' He said to the press in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, ` If <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> does n't come back, there wo n't be any second concert.' It ended up on TV and all of that.''

 He grew up in basketball-crazed <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and the irony was n't lost on <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Summer </PERSON>. Here he was, cooling off in the basketball locker room at <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Activity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, wearing his favorite, black hightop sneakers with the cheers of the crowd still ringing in his ears. But on this late September night, people did n't come to watch Summer play hoops in a charity pickup game. The fans paid big bucks to see him do what he really does for a living _ sing. `` Ever since I can remember, I wanted to be involved in music,'' said Summer in a backstage interview. `` I started out singing at age 3 or 4 in a church choir. I knew I could sing, and when I did people reacted differently than when other people sang. `` It was n't that I had a better voice than everybody else. I just know that when I do sing and I'm feeling what I'm singing, people can feel it, too. I love to get people excited. I noticed that real early on and got into it, even as a kid. There's a fine line between church and rock' n' roll, anyway. They're both dealing with the human spirit.'' Summer, now 34, is touring the country to promote his second album for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> called `` I've Got Everything.'' The LP, released in May, has sold about 400,000 copies and is closing in on gold status thanks to the hit single `` Hey Baby.'' His self-titled debut album for the label last year had the Top 20 hit `` I Wish I Had a Girl,'' but peaked at `` around 300,000-something'' in sales, according to Summer. `` I was n't happy with the way that album came out, but it was n't the producer's fault,'' said Summer, who writes and arranges his own songs and plays both acoustic guitar and keyboards `` I do n't like doing things more than once In the studio, you do things over and over and over and over. I only want to do it once and that's it. Summer's new LP, which he produced himself, was recorded at `` <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noise </ORGANIZATION>'' _ his home in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. `` There was equipment everywhere except the bedroom,'' he said. `` We miked the guitars in the kitchen, had the drums in the garage and put the mixing board in my living room. I just wanted things to sound live and most of the songs were done in one take. `` I was comfortable in my house and could sing whenever I felt like it, as opposed to being on a schedule. I used my band and three people from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cougar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellencamp </PERSON>'s band -LRB- guitarist <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanchic </PERSON>, bassist <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> and violinst <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Germano </PERSON> -RRB-. We recorded everything like a band and the vibe was right. When it was n't happening, we went and played basketball. The lanky, 6-foot-3 Summer grew up as <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON> in the small, farming community of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. -LRB- population 5,000 -RRB-, where he first sang at the Church of the Nazarene. He was a good enough high school guard to earn a full basketball scholarship to <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, but dropped out after one year. `` I was a big fish in a small pond. But that was the first time basketball started getting in the way of music,'' Summer said. `` I remember missing half the games. I was in bands and it was either go to the gigs or go to the away games.'' Summer, self-taught on drums, guitar and piano, headed to <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, where he perfected his husky vocals in nightclubs and learned roadhouse rhythm and blues plus fatback Southern boogie. He returned to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> in the early 1980s and released four singles and two albums on local, independent labels in 1982-86 before being signed by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> in October 1986. By then, he was already known as <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Summer </PERSON>. `` I started going by that 15 years ago,'' he said. `` I was in band called The Summer, so that's where the name came from. I got my first band together when I was 11. I've been in a million bands since then.'' Summer and his current six-piece band have opened for <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Money </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Doobie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> this year, and currently are on <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>'s tour. On the road, he often drives himself in a mini-van behind the band's bus and writes his melodies by humming into a tape machine on the seat next to him. Most of his latest songs are love ballads such as `` Something Is Missing,'' and `` What's a Poor Boy to Do.'' But he promises `` more up-tempo stuff'' for his next album. Summer has three tracks ready, including the song `` Low Flying Man'' that he is testing out on the road with favorable reaction. His shows usually end with a standing ovation after a few encores. `` I've always known that I had something to say musically. I know when I'm playing live, a lot of people can relate to what I'm singing,'' Summer said `` I doubt that I'll be the next <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>. But I think I'll be able to keep making records and reach a level. Maybe not platinum. If I can turn out gold records, that would be good enough for me.''

<HEAD>Elderly Recluse Froze to Death; Brother Charged</HEAD>

 Everyone in town knew of <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Krampitz </PERSON>, a deaf recluse who lived in a rundown white house next to a car dealership. They'd see her on frequent walks to the Bixby Memorial Free Library, where she would check out teen-age romance novels. She never married, never held a job. That's about all most folks know of her life, but many know of her death. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Krampitz </PERSON> was found frozen to death, alone, in the house in which she was born 82 years ago _ a home with no running water, no central heat and just a coal stove to warm the single room in which she lived. Her 69-year-old brother, <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON>, was charged with neglect of the elderly. <PERSON> Krampitz </PERSON> was his sister's legal guardian and the state says he is responsible for the conditions in which she was living. He has pleaded innocent and wo n't talk about the case. Trial has been delayed indefinitely. `` I think most folks are afraid of dying by themselves,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the business next door to <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>'s house at 20 Main Street `` I do n't know if that could be true of <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Krampitz </PERSON>.'' Community efforts to reach out to her simply failed, some neighbors say. City Clerk <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> recalled that one Christmas a Boy Scout troop wanted to take her a holiday basket. She threw the contents across her battered porch. It seems many folks have their own <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Krampitz </PERSON> stories. On several occasions, <PERSON> Jackman </PERSON> said, she dumped leaves and shrubbery on cars parked alongside her home. Maybe she did n't like their color, he said. A barbed-wire fence was erected between the dealership and the house. Conditions were a surprise `` and we were right next door. Nowadays, something like that, in a little country town, you do n't expect that to happen,'' he said But authorities say <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Krampitz </PERSON> knew how his sister was living. In a 1985 letter to the city arguing that a $ 30,200 appraisal on the house was too high, he wrote: `` The house has no running water due to the pipes and plumbing all freezing up and breaking everything. There is no kitchen as such, no electricy -LRB- sic -RRB- in the upper part of the house ... The roof leaked badly in the past and the plaster is off the ceilings and walls in most of the house. The windows and the outside of the house is allin -LRB- sic -RRB- bad need of repair, but I: m -LRB- sic -RRB- nN he position ot -LRB- sic -RRB- spend 20,000 to repair the old place under present circumstances with my sister in there.'' The appraisal was lowered to $ 24,400, according to court documents. Because there was no plumbing, <PERSON> Krampitz </PERSON> took his sister water in jugs, court records said. When <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Chartier </PERSON> asked if he had considered getting the plumbing fixed, <PERSON> Krampitz </PERSON> said, `` No chance _ cause it would just get ruined in no time at all.'' Chartier wrote in an affidavit that there was a three-foot pile of human waste in a room that used to be the kitchen. <LOCATION> Vergennes </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON> said it was so cold in the house he could n't even smell it <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON> also recalls the books found all over the house _ even the bathtub was full of them. And there was <PERSON> Krampitz </PERSON>'s diary, in which she noted holidays and made detailed entries about the weather. The last entry was Dec. 9, 1988. Her body was found 10 days later. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> provided fuel assistance checks, and some of that money can not be accounted for, <PERSON> Chartier </PERSON> wrote. Few people admit knowing <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Krampitz </PERSON> well, and those who did declined to talk about her. But one librarian made a face when told that others in town had said <PERSON> Kramptiz </PERSON> was crabby. She looked away and murmured it simply was n't true. <ORGANIZATION> Addison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, said, `` I'm aware that she was an unfriendly old bird,'' but `` the purpose of having a guardianship of someone is because they're unable to take care of themselves.'' Some 500,000 elderly Americans are believed to be under guardianship, judged unable to care for themselves or their finances and made wards of the court. This strips the wards of control over their lives, including where they can live, what medical treatment they receive and how their money is spent. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> believes the case has done a great deal to raise awareness about elder abuse. `` Perhaps probate judges may not have as high a good faith assumption now that they might have had in the past,'' he said. One in 25 older adults is abused, according to an estimate in a 1985 report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, `` Elder Abuse: A National Disgrace.'' The abuse takes all forms: psychological and physical torment, neglect and theft. The <PERSON> Krampitz </PERSON> case `` made every public official ... more aware of these kinds of conditions,'' said City Manager and health officer <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON>, adding he did n't realize the conditions but he's not certain what he could have done. `` <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> was left in the care of her brother. There it is. I'm not proud of this situation. I do n't think I'm responsible -LRB- But -RRB- I'm a part of this community.'' <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> wondered what would have happened had he kicked <PERSON> Krampitz </PERSON> out of the house. `` I just wonder what the editorial would have been.'' `` It has opened the city's eyes, A lot of these things you're not aware of until something happens And then you say, ` Oh, my goodness,''' <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said. `` I feel awfully bad about this one,'' said Probate Court Judge <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>, who supervised <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Krampitz </PERSON>'s guardianship. `` I was asked by an agency, ` Do you think you've got any more?' I mean what can I say. I hope not. I'd hate to think anyone else is out there in this position.'' When <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Krampitz </PERSON> died, she had no resources to draw on. The state paid $ 885 to bury her. Prospect Cemetery caretaker <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rheaume </PERSON> erected a simple wooden cross near the family monument to mark her grave. <ORGANIZATION> Vergennes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Methodist Minister Rev. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen-Crowder </PERSON> remembered the stark burial attended only by <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Krampitz </PERSON>, his wife and funeral home workers. Afterward, <PERSON> Krampitz </PERSON> told him, `` I'm glad it's over. `` It was an unsettling kind of thing,'' said <PERSON> Andersen-Crowder </PERSON>. `` I felt a certain amount of guilt. I felt like we as a community really let her down.''

<HEAD>Innovative Volunteer Credit Program Helps Elderly, Disabled</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Cassie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> cooks breakfast and lunch for <PERSON> Josh </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> every other day when he's not on dialysis, and does laundry for his grandmother. `` I understand elderly people because I'm 63 years old and I have an older father, too. He's 90,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a team leader with the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consortium </ORGANIZATION>, a volunteer program for the elderly and disabled. She collects one service credit for each hour she volunteers. Working three to five hours a day, she takes clients to doctor's appointments, fixes meals and runs errands She can save the credits for herself or donate them. `` It's kind of like insurance. The best kind is the kind you never have to use,'' said a volunteer in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. Other states with programs are <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Only in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> are they statewide. Service credit programs, operating much like barter banks, are run by groups ranging from a health maintenance organization serving Hassidic Jewish and Italian communities in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on Aging in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Mission District. Volunteers are most commonly used for respite care, giving a break to the person with the primary responsibility for a sick or disabled relative. Federal studies show families provide about 80 percent of care to the ailing elderly. Service credits `` can be used to target specific needs that are a public priority,'' said <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor and head of the project at the <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Aging. <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, a speechwriter for then-Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and later for <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON> <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON> in the War on Poverty, devised the idea of service credits nine years ago while teaching law at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>. He worked out the economic implications during six months at the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>. `` The purchasing power of a service credit may or may not be that important, but just accruing them seems to make people feel better,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, 26 agencies from churches to hospices and neighborhood groups send service-credit volunteers to play checkers, read, go for walks and write letters but not get involved in household chores, bathing or medical services. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, 515 volunteers are working up to 6,000 hours a month, mostly performing services that were never done before and are not funded by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> or other federal programs. The average age of volunteers in a program run by the HMO in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> borough of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> is about 75. Credits are recorded, usually on a computer, and monthly or quarterly statements may be mailed, given at meetings or on the phone. `` The beauty of it is that it says everybody's time is valuable. We just ca n't put people on the scrap heap,'' said <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>. `` I think we're really talking about a redefinition of the roles of the market economy and what it does well and the non-market economy and what it does well.'' Pressure on the government to provide more services can be resolved with service credit programs at little or no cost, said <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, who also helped write the blueprint for the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> program, led an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> citizens watchdog group that produced a pioneering report on hunger in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and served as special counsel to the chairman of the Navajo tribe. The <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> invested $ 1.2 million in six groups as a test of the concept. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> is in the second year of its three-year grant. `` The programs are feeling that they're riding a crest now, that everybody feels the money is n't there to solve social problems so there's got to be another solution,'' <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said. The mobility of the American family also played a role in his thinking. `` It fills a critical gap in a community where we live as strangers'' by giving a way for people to help. `` If this did n't go on, neighbors could live next to each other in abject need with no mechanism to bring them together.'' `` We are not attempting to reinvent the volunteer services,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Incentive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our programs are asked to network with the existing volunteer programs, so if we are alerted to a caregiver at such and such an address, if there is a church group that already has volunteers available, that volunteer receives the service credits.'' <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, which offered its first services in January, has recruited young volunteers who can offer their credits to grandparents as Christmas or birthday presents. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> is working with schools to recruit teen-age volunteers.

 It sounded more like a kennel than a corporate lunchroom, but despite all the yelping, yapping and leash-tangling going on, the luncheon for the Pets for People Program went remarkably well. `` I was pleasantly surprised. We did n't have any ` incidents' at all,'' said <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Ralston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purina </ORGANIZATION> nationwide pet adoption program that pairs senior citizens with homeless dogs and cats. The potential was there, to be sure. But the lone cat went mostly unnoticed and trained dog handlers were on hand in case of trouble. `` I've been to all kinds of parties,'' said one guest who attended with his adopted dog. `` But this is the first time I've been to a dog party. The recent party was the kickoff for the third year of the program that has matched people with nearly 25,000 pets from 180 participating shelters. Hosts were actresses <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockhart </PERSON>, of `` Lassie'' fame, and <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Meadows </PERSON>, best known for her role as <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramden </PERSON> on `` The Honeymooners.'' `` Pet-owning seniors are healthier and happier,'' <PERSON> Meadows </PERSON> said. `` But no one needs to tell you how they've changed your life.'' `` We're very pleased with the success of the program,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` We've had a positive impact on two seemingly unrelated problems, pet overpopulation and our nation's lonely senior citizens.'' The benefits of pet companionship has yet to be fully documented, but it's clear pets can provide affection, entertainment and companionship. A recent survey of 900 adopters found that 92 percent felt less lonely, 91 percent were happier, 80 percent felt less stress and 69 percent thought they were healthier as a result of owning a pet. Caring for pets gave many adopters a feeling of being needed and even a reason to exercise. For some, it provided a source of conversation and an avenue for new friendships. Angel has certainly made a difference in <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Knollhoff </PERSON>'s life <PERSON> Knollhoff </PERSON>, 87, was honored at the luncheon with a special prize for being the oldest adopter. Angel _ part schnauzer, part poodle _ accompanied her. `` She's my alarm clock at seven in the morning,'' <PERSON> Knollhoff </PERSON> said, giving the little dog a hug. `` I'd sleep all day if it was n't for her. Nearby, a tablecloth hid all but the head of a large collie named Coty, whose chin rested on <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardrey </PERSON>'s knee. <PERSON> Ardrey </PERSON> said she adopted Coty from a shelter because of her niece's concerns about her living alone at age 85 `` Everybody was walking right by <PERSON> Coty </PERSON>,'' she said, patting his head. `` Nobody wanted him _ they said he was too big. But he turned out to be a good dog. I would n't give him up for nothing.'' <PERSON> Hester </PERSON> and <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> had always owned dogs, so when their last pet grew old and sick and had to be put to sleep, they soon adopted another one. `` I told them we did n't want a little lap dog, so they gave us a big lap dog,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, pointing to Buddy, a golden retriever at her feet. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> eased his concerns about his parents, who are both in their 80s. `` My dad was in the hospital and <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> kept my mom company while he was gone. He laid right by the door and barked when anyone came. We did n't even know he could bark until then.'' Pets for People is a non-profit organization financed through the purchase of Purina products. For every dog or cat adopted, it gives $ 100 to the shelter to cover the adoption fee, inoculations and spaying or neutering. The adopters also receive a pet-care starter set with a collar, leash, bowls and food. Any person over 60 can apply. Participating animal shelters help evaluate applicants and help them choose compatible pets. `` I just ca n't say enough about it,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Grove </PERSON>, the executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associaton </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. `` I think the idea of taking older animals out of the shelter _ the very ones who do n't get adopted as often _ and making them special to other people is what it's all about. `` We've often had older people come in and ask us if they could get a dog for free, and up until now, we were unable to afford that.''

<HEAD>Families Alone Can't Bear Growing Burden of Caregiving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s older population growing and women entering the workforce in record numbers, families alone will not be able to handle their long-term care needs, business and government experts agree. Caring for an aged relative can be a `` treasured time of sharing'' for many, but competing family and career demands can make it `` a time of pain, struggle and exhaustion that may stretch to the breaking point their capacity to care,'' <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasse </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Older </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said at a recent congressional forum on `` eldercare.'' `` Without help for family caregivers, the only alternative for the elderly may be a nursing home. By helping prevent caregiver burnout, we enable families to continue caring for their elderly members,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, a forum sponsor. The American Association of Retired Persons found in 1987 that nearly 7 million Americans spent 10-12 hours a week providing care to older people. More than half also worked outside the home and almost one-third cared for children. As the population ages, the probability is overwhelming that virtually every American will become a caregiver, according to <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION>. With some surveys indicating as many as 25 percent of American workers already bear some caregiving responsibility, employers are increasingly helping workers double as caregivers without their job performance suffering. `` We certainly recognize that caregiving is a demanding and distracting job, especially caring for the elderly,'' said <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullady </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Champion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s employee assistance program. Champion is among a growing number of companies offering `` eldercare'' benefits such as unpaid leave, workshops and advice on caring for dependent relatives, and educational materials on aging issues and services. Employees are `` trying desperately to hold it all together'' as they juggle work and family responsibilities, said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Leibold </PERSON>, of Stride Rite Children's Centers. In addition to the `` mommy track'' _ where working mothers are unable to take demanding job promotions because of competing needs at home _ there is a `` daughter track'' that holds back women who care for aged relatives. `` We as employers really have to begin taking a pro-active stance in helping our employees meet all of these needs,'' <PERSON> Leibold </PERSON> said. `` Anything we can do as employers to help in their efforts can really create a win-win situation for everyone.'' Stride Rite next year plans to expand the child care center at its <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, headquarters into an intergenerational facility that will serve about 55 children and 24 frail adults. Half the slots will be filled with relatives of company employees and half from the community. `` We think and we hope that it's really going to address issues like absenteeism and turnover,'' <PERSON> Leibold </PERSON> said. The support for eldercare benefits comes in response to mounting evidence that the stress of caregiving can hurt job performance. Executives surveyed by <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hancock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and Fortune magazine, for example, said caregivers took more unscheduled days off and left work early. <PERSON> Mullady </PERSON> recalls that her own job evaluations slipped a notch when she was caring for her dying 92-year-old mother. `` I was not at peak performance; there was no way I could have been.'' The prolonged stress of caregiving also can adversely affect mental and physical health, said Dr. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on Aging. Studies found significant symptoms of depression in many caregivers, and some experienced changes in their immune system that made them more vulnerable to a range of physical illnesses. `` Society is beginning to appreciate the ramifications of the remarkable demographic revolution,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` What society has n't fully appreciated is that those ramifications apply not only to the older individual but to the family system as a whole.'' Caregiving needs are expected to triple over the next four decades, requiring further growth in the `` eldercare'' industry and more cooperation between businesses and state and local agencies on aging, said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Posman </PERSON>, acting associate commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Aging. <PERSON> Glasse </PERSON> said employers' programs are only part of the answer; the nation needs to ensure that all Americans receive the long-term care they need, both in nursing homes and at home, without putting all the burden on family members. Some advocates for the elderly have expressed concern that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may shy away from addressing the problem after biting criticism from senior citizens over the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> catastrophic care program enacted last year.

<HEAD>No Regrets After 32 Years On The Federal Appeals Court</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Nothing short of catastrophe stops 84-year-old <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Minor </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisdom </PERSON>, now in his 32nd year as a federal appeals court judge. It hurts to watch him walk. A slight man, stooped and gray, he creaks along, leaning heavily on a cane. Both knees are artificial; arthritis ruined the ones he was born with. Surgeons rummaged around inside his chest recently to repair a major artery in his heart. His aorta was about to blow out like an old inner tube. Surgery cost him six weeks in a hospital and a month at home. But being stuck in bed did n't mean not working for Wisdom, a member of a special three-judge court handling still another racial desegregation case. Court fights involving race have been a large part of his working day since he was appointed to the 5th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> in 1957. He nearly always came down on the side of blacks fighting segregation. `` The more exposure you get to this problem the more you realize that the blacks have had a raw deal for 300 years and that we owe a debt to them.'' Wisdom and one or more of three other judges with similar outlooks _ <PERSON> Elbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rives </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> _ got most of the racial cases, and were dubbed `` The Four'' by their brethren Four landmark decisions, written by Wisdom in 1965-67, whipped the crawl of school desegregation to a gallop. Instead of the `` all deliberate speed'' pace of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> imposed immediate affirmative action. When he was appointed to the court, <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisdom </ORGANIZATION> seemed more like a contented member of the upper crust than likely to shake up the Deep South. `` I was much more moderate than I am now. It was a gradual progression in my philosophy,'' he said. Wisdom's ancestors came in the 1840s from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. He was born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in 1905, graduated from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, studied English at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> for a year, took law at <LOCATION> Tulane </LOCATION>. Political activism was Wisdom's road to the bench. At the 1952 Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> he led a fight to have <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> delegates from <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> seated instead of delegates committed to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>. The victory was the turning point in <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>'s bid for nomination. Buses full of tourists used to pause in front of the Wisdom mansion while the tour guide exalted him as the man who made <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> president. In return, <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> kept Wisdom from becoming a much richer man. At the time of his appointment to the <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION>, he was a founding member of what is still one of the city's biggest, busiest law firms. Decreeing racial integration for others did not change his own social habits much. He remained a member of all-white, all-male exclusive clubs. Such conflict with his legal views did not disturb him. `` I ca n't change their minds,'' he said, `` and they ca n't change mine.'' `` I took a lot of kidding,'' he recalled recently. `` One fellow, every time he saw me would say, ` Hey, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, what have you done to us white folks today?''' Amiable jibes were n't enough for some. Wisdom found rattlesnakes on his lawn. Two of his dogs were poisoned. `` For years they tried to keep me awake nights. I'd get telephone calls between one and four o'clock in the morning. We could n't take the phone off the hook because we had two kids off at school and we felt they should be able to get hold of us.'' Hostilities stayed at the harassment level. Wisdom never bothered to ask for police protection, `` and to my knowledge I was never given protection,'' he said. `` My office door was open, just like it is now.'' Despite age and aches, Wisdom still works. In 1977, he stepped back to senior status _ semi-retirement _ eliminating administrative duties. But he hears as many cases as ever and often sits on other circuits. `` I sit all over the place,'' he said. `` I go to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. But I am going to lessen up over the coming year.''

 From time to time everyone forgets where he or she leaves the car keys, or the car. But can you imagine forgetting how to drive? Whether it's an aged aunt, grandparent, or our own parents, many of us have had some experience with older people who experience failing mental abilities. I am surprised how many people still equate this loss with old age. Thirty years of research on aging tells us that when memory loss interferes with daily living, it is not normal but the result of some underlying disease. Identifying the disease is n't always easy but it is extremely important for the person with this problem to have a medical evaluation. For some, the illness can be treated and the memory loss and confusion clear up. For others, the cause is a progressive brain disease, such as Alzheimer's disease. Although there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease yet, that does n't mean there is no treatment. Good medical care from someone who knows the range of problems Alzheimer's patients have can help patients live as normal a life as possible and make the job of caring for them much easier on their families. We estimate that 4 million people in this country may now have Alzheimer's disease, about 10 percent of the population over age 65. Although uncommon in people in their 50s and 60s current studies indicate that by their ninth decade at least one of every four people will become afflicted. The economic burden is at least $ 80 billion a year _ enough to bankrupt a small nation. Because many disorders mimic Alzheimer's, it is difficult to diagnose. In fact, diagnosis can only be made with 100 percent certainty by examining brain tissue after a patient dies. Nonetheless, specialists at major medical centers now have an array of tests offering reliable diagnosis more than 90 percent of the time, compared with 60 percent to 80 percent accuracy just 10 years ago. On the federal level, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on Aging funds 15 Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers. And the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Aging and the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> support long-term care centers, important sources of research and training for those who deal with dementia and other illnesses of aging. On the state level, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> now support specialized Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and treatment centers. No one knows for sure what causes Alzheimer's disease. We do know from tissue examined under a microscope that certain brain cells stop working and die. Among the experimental treatments being explored are those looking at ways to stop or reverse brain cell death. One especially exciting area involves use of substances produced in the brain that help nerve cells thrive. This may hold promise for treating neurological diseases and brain damage from injury. Many important research advances have occurred in the past year. For example, an abnormal protein that accumulates in the Alzheimer brain has been found in the skin and other organs, one more clue that this is not simply a disease of the brain, and a possible step toward a simple test for it. Another area that is of practical value involves patient care. While average survival ranges between six and 10 years, some Alzheimer's patients live more than 20 years. As the disease progresses, the need for continuous care puts great stress on caregivers. Studies of patients and their caregivers are teaching us how families cope and helping to prepare health professionals and policymakers to meet their needs. In the meantime, organizations like the national, non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Alzheimer </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> offer patients and families services ranging from support groups to information on the disease and referrals to community services. And every state and community in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a government agency on aging to assist older people. Over half the states have task forces or commissions to study the problem of Alzheimer's in their state. Many offer Alzheimer's <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION>, some with toll-free numbers. States with large ethnic populations like <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> have educational programs tailored to minority caregivers' needs. Public @ private partnerships are also springing up to meet the needs of caregivers. One example is the Administration on Aging, which is working with the <ORGANIZATION> Alzheimer </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> to implement dementia day care and short-term respite services. Workplace programs are being developed by private groups like the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in recognition of the growing impact of dementia on employed caregivers. More information on the Alzheimer's Association is available by calling 1-800-621-0379 -LRB- in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, call 1-800-572-6037 -RRB-. Information on research is available from the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NIA </ORGANIZATION>, at 301-496-1752.

 Do n't overlook the potential danger of common ornamental plants when making precautionary checks before visits from pre-schoolers. The worst that happens usually involves only some anxious moments after little <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> or <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> is seen munching on a leaf or swallowing a berry. But quite painful or life-threatening experiences are possible. It's something like having a backyard swimming pool. The proportion of children and adults getting into trouble is infinitesimal compared to everyone's exposure, but the danger is nonetheless real. Most of the big-leaf houseplants, like dieffenbachia and philodendron, can cause trouble to the unwary. Berries of plants such as privet, holly and castor beans can be toxic. So can bulbs of daffodils, crocus and hyacinths; pods of birds of paradise; seeds from sweet peas; acorns and all parts of oleanders. The list is so general, in fact, that a basic rule is never to put anything in your mouth unless you're sure it's safe. To adults this is so obvious that Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunkel </PERSON> says, `` Plant poisoning questions are almost exclusively childhood problems.'' <PERSON> Kunkel </PERSON> is in his 10th year as medical director of the <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> that covers <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and two adjoining counties. It offers emergency guidance on all types of poison questions, and a breakdown of last year's nearly 40,000 calls shows about 5 percent involved plants. <PERSON> Kunkel </PERSON> estimates 95 percent of those concerned children under age 5. `` We get a substantial number of calls from grandparents, not just about plants, of course, but all things. Kids are over to grandma's and grandpa's house, and it's kind of a new environment and they're poking through things. Grandparents, if they're not careful, can become a pretty good source of poison.'' <PERSON> Kunkel </PERSON>, a gardener, believes it's ridiculous to consider discarding plants because of potential toxicity. But he recommends keeping houseplants above the reach of toddlers. Outdoors, he suggests instruction, just as children are taught to stay out of the street or not play with fire. The center's 1988 calls about plants are n't broken down between indoors and outdoors, `` but looking at the types of plants listed I'd estimate 20 to 30 percent were indoor plants,'' <PERSON> Kunkel </PERSON> said. `` Most were inquiries about whether a plant is poisonous. I do n't have any figures on how many were actually hospitalized after treatment but it would be rare, perhaps a couple dozen kids in 10 years. Once or twice a year, kids have their stomachs pumped out. However, it's something you always worry about when you get such a call. And there are quite a few plants if you eat enough of them you'll have nausea, diarrhea, things like that.'' In recent years, deaths have been recorded in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> from water hemlock -LRB- <LOCATION> Cicuta </LOCATION> douglasii -RRB- and tree tobacco -LRB- Nicotiana glaula -RRB-, which grow mainly in remote areas. Four deaths from oleander were reported nationally this decade, but, <PERSON> Kunkel </PERSON> said, all involved adults who took it intentionally. `` The kid who occasionally nibbles on the leaf of an oleander probably is n't in a great risk. But we certainly recommend that a Poison Center be contacted and given a chance to evaluate the situation.'' A common name for dieffenbachia is dumbcane. When chewed, it causes quick swelling of mucus membranes around the mouth and tongue, causing difficulty in breathing. Death is possible. Fellow members of the Araceae family, such as philodendrons and caladiums, may have similar effects. African violets and begonias also cause concern. Fortunately, most problem plants are quite bitter to taste, discouraging the attempt. But even parts of common foodstuffs can be dangerous, so know what you're eating. Avoid, for example, seeds of apples, leaves of rhubarb or sun-exposed, greenish parts of the potato tuber. It's wise to identify your plants in advance of any need. If buying new plants, ask the nursery people what parts, if any, are toxic. The nursery often can help in identifying plant samples, experienced neighborhood gardeners are another possibility, and most poison centers offer illustrative brochures.

<HEAD>Study Finds Aerobic Exercise Good for Older People, Too</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Healthy older people who did aerobic exercises in a four-month study improved their physical well-being and their outlook on life. The study of 101 healthy men and women age 60-83 found that those who participated in an hour-long aerobic exercise program three times a week showed improved cardiorespiratory fitness, lower cholesterol, a small weight loss and an increase in bone mineral content among subjects at risk of bone fractures. The moderate-intensity exercise program included a 10-minute warmup, 30 minutes of bicycling, 15 of brisk walking-jogging and 5 of cool-down exercises. Other subjects in the study participated in a yoga and flexibility exercise program or were part of a control group whose members did not change their physical activity habits. These groups showed no improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness. While the study found no significant changes in a battery of psychological tests, members of the aerobic and yoga groups felt healthier and slept better and `` reported improved family relations, better sex life, less loneliness and a better social life ... improved mood, self-confidence and life satisfaction, and that they had better memory and concentration,'' the researchers reported. Members of the control group noticed little change over the four months. The research, carried out by scientists from <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, was financed by grants from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on Aging and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION>, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Nursing Home Residents Often See Life as Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Elderly people often consider their life stories to be over by the time they enter a nursing home, says a sociologist who asked nursing-home residents to divide their lives into chapters. `` Rarely does the last chapter include their current situation,'' said <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> Gubrium </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>. `` It may end at retirement or when a spouse dies _ but it rarely ends with the nursing home.'' Although the elderly acknowledge their current existence in a nursing home, they do not deem it part of their lives, <PERSON> Gubrium </PERSON> said. His study, funded by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aging </ORGANIZATION>, found that the few people who have close relationships in a nursing home are likeliest to consider the institution home-like and the experience a meaningful part of their lives. `` When we ask nursing home patients if the place is home, they'll say ` No. It's homey, but it's not home.' One woman who did call the place home said her roommate was like a sister to her and several other people were like family to her,'' <PERSON> Gubrium </PERSON> said. Others said nursing homes would be more like home if they were free to come and go. Dependence and poor health _ not the nursing home itself _ separated `` just living'' from life in these people. `` We chose people close to the end of life for this study because we wanted to see if life extends subjectively to the very end,'' he said. <PERSON> Gubrium </PERSON> began his two-year study this fall by interviewing residents of nursing homes, adult congregate living facilities and the general community in the <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION> area. Unlike nursing home residents, other people in the study include their current living circumstances as part of their lives.

 <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s largest bank, said today that it offered to buy British merchant bank <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> in a friendly cash deal valued at $ 1.48 billion. The move was designed to block a hostile bid for <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indosuez </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 8.56-a-share offer was $ 1.15 per share over <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION>'s close Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. However, the announcement pushed <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION>'s stock slightly above the offer price. The bid came three days before a vote by shareholders of <ORGANIZATION> Willis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a British insurance services concern, on whether to sell its remaining 9.9-percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indosuez </ORGANIZATION> for $ 7.19 a share.

In a joint statement today, <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> said the British bank `` will operate as a separate legal entity within the <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> group and with a high degree of autonomy.'' <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has for years held a 4.9-percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Grenfell </PERSON> had initiated talks with the German bank and a number of other European financial institutions over a protective alliance after <ORGANIZATION> Indosuez </ORGANIZATION> announced its takeover intentions. <PERSON> Indosuez </PERSON>, however, could raise its offer to <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Faber </PERSON>, make a general offer topping <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, or simply sell its stake to <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> at a profit.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers resumed negotiations on Monday in an effort to reach an oil production and price agreement for the first half of 1990. Seven oil ministers from the 13-member <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> gathered in a hotel room to see if they could overcome their differences. The oil markets adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward the oil producers' regular winter conference, now in its third day. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> Brent Blend, the most widely traded international crude oil, was quoted at a spot price of $ 18.47 a barrel in quiet dealings Monday, up slightly from $ 18.44 late Friday. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grade of crude, was down slightly in early trading with the near-term contract at $ 19.79 a barrel, down 3 cents from Friday's close. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> was at an impasse, and loosely split into two camps, over how to meet demands from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> for bigger shares of the cartel's production pie, sources said Sunday. `` We have not yet reached the stage of proposals. The issues are so sensitive apparently that no one dares putting foreward proposals,'' Algerian oil minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Boussena </PERSON> said. `` We are still at the starting point. The cartel's gathering formally began on Saturday, and the ministers suspended talks on Sunday to reflect on their options. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members in the past have found such breaks, as well as holding small group discussions in their hotels, more productive than gathering all the ministers at the cartel's <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> headquarters. The ministers must decide whether to change their production ceiling of 20.5 million barrels a day and their target price of $ 18 a barrel. Oil prices have been firm, with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` basket,'' or composite, of crude oils at $ 17.76 a barrel lately, even though analysts say <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members are exceeding the group's output ceiling by more than 2.5 million barrels a day. Prices are more than $ 5 a barrel higher than a year ago because of strong demand for oil from Third World countries and a decline in output from non-OPEC producers. But <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is expecting demand to fall in the first six months of next year. The oil market traditionally softens in the first and second quarters as winter heating demands slacken before summer cooling and gasoline demands pick up. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> have been pumping about double, or 2 million barrels a day each, what they are allowed under the last <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreement, underscoring their calls for bigger shares. All the ministers appear to agree that the total ceiling could be raised, perhaps by as much as 2 million barrels a day, but they disagree on how the increase should be parceled out. A ministerial source, who demanded anonymity, on Sunday described the two loose camps this way: One camp, led by the heavyweights <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, thinks the increase in production should be granted to those members who can produce more. Some members already are operating at near capacity. This idea would allow <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> to pump more, and would leave unchanged the shares for <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The rest of the members would reduce their shares of a larger pie. But this idea is onerous to poorer members that are more dependent on their oil revenues, the ministerial source said. The second camp believes all the members should give up part of their share to allow <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> larger slices, the ministerial source said. But <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has insisted it wo n't accept less than its allotment of one-quarter of the total production limit. It recently increased its production above its quota, a move analysts say is designed to emphasize that point. The fallback position would be to increase production equally among all members, the ministerial source said. But this would n't address <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>' demands for bigger shares, nor solve the problem of cheating on quotas, which undermines <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s aims <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Boussena </PERSON> said an option being considered is an agreement that would not be signed by all 13 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members. <PERSON> Boussena </PERSON> added, `` We must have an agreement of 13. That is my point of view.'' <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> could simply roll over its existing accord, as it has done in the past, but the oil markets likely would view such a move as a sign of weakness. Failure to reach an agreement could bring oil prices to as low as $ 12 a barrel by the spring, the anonymous ministerial source said.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers resumed negotiations today in an effort to reach an oil production and price agreement for the first half of 1990. Seven oil ministers from the 13-member <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> gathered in a hotel room to see if they could overcome their differences. The oil markets adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward the oil producers' regular winter conference, now in its third day. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> Brent Blend, the most widely traded international crude oil, was quoted at a spot price of $ 18.47 a barrel in quiet dealings Monday, up slightly from $ 18.44 late Friday. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grade of crude, was down slightly in early trading with the near-term contract at $ 19.79 a barrel, down 3 cents from Friday's close. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> was at an impasse, and loosely split into two camps, over how to meet demands from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> for bigger shares of the cartel's production pie, sources said Sunday. `` We have not yet reached the stage of proposals. The issues are so sensitive apparently that no one dares putting foreward proposals,'' Algerian oil minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Boussena </PERSON> said. `` We are still at the starting point. The cartel's gathering formally began on Saturday, and the ministers suspended talks on Sunday to reflect on their options. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members in the past have found such breaks, as well as holding small group discussions in their hotels, more productive than gathering all the ministers at the cartel's <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> headquarters. The ministers must decide whether to change their production ceiling of 20.5 million barrels a day and their target price of $ 18 a barrel. Oil prices have been firm, with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` basket,'' or composite, of crude oils at $ 17.76 a barrel lately, even though analysts say <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members are exceeding the group's output ceiling by more than 2.5 million barrels a day. Prices are more than $ 5 a barrel higher than a year ago because of strong demand for oil from Third World countries and a decline in output from non-OPEC producers. But <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is expecting demand to fall in the first six months of next year. The oil market traditionally softens in the first and second quarters as winter heating demands slacken before summer cooling and gasoline demands pick up. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> have been pumping about double, or 2 million barrels a day each, what they are allowed under the last <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreement, underscoring their calls for bigger shares. All the ministers appear to agree that the total ceiling could be raised, perhaps by as much as 2 million barrels a day, but they disagree on how the increase should be parceled out. A ministerial source, who demanded anonymity, on Sunday described the two loose camps this way: One camp, led by the heavyweights <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, thinks the increase in production should be granted to those members who can produce more. Some members already are operating at near capacity. This idea would allow <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> to pump more, and would leave unchanged the shares for <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The rest of the members would reduce their shares of a larger pie. But this idea is onerous to poorer members that are more dependent on their oil revenues, the ministerial source said. The second camp believes all the members should give up part of their share to allow <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> larger slices, the ministerial source said. But <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has insisted it wo n't accept less than its allotment of one-quarter of the total production limit. It recently increased its production above its quota, a move analysts say is designed to emphasize that point. The fallback position would be to increase production equally among all members, the ministerial source said. But this would n't address <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>' demands for bigger shares, nor solve the problem of cheating on quotas, which undermines <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s aims <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Boussena </PERSON> said an option being considered is an agreement that would not be signed by all 13 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members. <PERSON> Boussena </PERSON> added, `` We must have an agreement of 13. That is my point of view.'' <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> could simply roll over its existing accord, as it has done in the past, but the oil markets likely would view such a move as a sign of weakness. Failure to reach an agreement could bring oil prices to as low as $ 12 a barrel by the spring, the anonymous ministerial source said.

<TEXT>
 The number of working <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil and gas rigs dropped for the second straight week, declining by three this week to 1,037 after rising 10 times in the past 13 weeks. But the total still reflects 126 more working rigs than for the same week a year ago, <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. Last week, the count dropped by five to 1,040. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil toolmaker company that merged with <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has kept track of the rig count since 1940. In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures. Among major oil producing states, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> posted the largest gains with 10 new rigs, while <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> had three more. Declines included a drop of five in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and drops of three rigs each in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The number of rigs in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> remained unchanged. There were no reports for other producing states.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> published their first editions under a partial merger today after a three-year legal battle, but a possible strike may stall the joint operation before it's a week old. Talks between the newspapers and the unions broke off Sunday over wage and benefit demands. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the combined operations, said he does n't expect a strike. `` I have consistently felt that labor matters can be resolved and I continue to feel that way,'' he said Sunday. Detroit's two major daily newspapers began publishing under a joint operating agreement following a vote Nov. 13 by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which upheld lower court rulings approving the 100-year agreement. The <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> Inc.-owned Free Press declared it was a financially failing newspaper in April 1986 and applied with the News for permission to enter the operating agreement. Federal law grants newspapers exemption from antitrust law if it's determined a merger would prevent the failure of a paper and thus preserve two independent editorial voices. According to figures released Nov. 13, the daily circulation of the News, the nation's ninth largest newspaper, is 690,422, and 832,383 Sundays. The Free Press, the 10th biggest paper, had circulations of 626,434 and 687,537. The newspapers merged business operations under the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. News and editorial departments remain separate and independent but combined editions will be published on the weekend under the masthead The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and Free Press. About 500 jobs were to be cut as a result of the arrangement. While the newspapers prepared the first post-agreement edition of the Free Press for today, workers voted against ratifying a contract offer from the new newspaper agency and in favor of strike authorization. Teamsters Local 372, which represents 1,100 drivers and other circulation workers, set a strike deadline of 12:01 a.m. Thursday. Newspaper Guild Local 22, representing about 500 editorial workers from both papers, voted unanimously to support a strike. `` The members of both papers feel the money package and benefits were an insult to them,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mleczko </PERSON>, a News reporter and president of Local 22. `` The publishers are going to have to share some of the new riches from the 100-year monopoly they have been granted from the court.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giles </PERSON>, president and publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said he expected issues to be resolved before the strike <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kummer </PERSON>, administrative officer for Local 22, said: `` What we're looking at is the company testing the union to see if they'll strike. Press operators in the Graphics Communications International Local 13-N surprised other unions by ratifying the wage offer from the publishers. But they pledged to honor picket lines if the other unions walked out. In other ratification votes announced Sunday, the unions representing <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> photoengravers, workers who handle special inserts and sort papers, and composing room employees also rejected the new company's contract offers. <PERSON> Mleczko </PERSON> said the publishers offered a $ 30-per-week raise during the first year of a 2 -LCB- - year contract, $ 30 the second year and $ 15 for the remaining six months, and a signing bonus equal to two weeks' pay The unions wanted a $ 40-per-week raise the first year, $ 30 the second and $ 40 for the next six months, plus a three-week bonus. The unions also asked the newspaper to pay for increases in health care costs for future retirees. Fifty percent of those costs currently are paid by unions. Union members at the two newspapers have had one raise in their contracts since the operating agreement was announced in 1986. The average wage for editorial employees and production workers at the newspapers is $ 562 a week. Teamsters officials said the strike was set for Thursday to give the employees time to get established under the new operations. The last newspaper strike in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> was at the Free Press in July 1980 when Teamsters stayed away 12 days over economic issues.

<HEAD>Soybean Decline Drags Corn Down; Wheat Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices fell in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, dragging the corn market lower. But wheat futures gained slightly on indications of renewed Soviet buying interest. Selling of soybean futures stemmed from a continued lack of export demand, analysts said. An abundance of Malaysian palm oil on the world market is forcing soybean oil prices lower and European soybean processers are believed to have enough beans on hand to last them through December, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Biedermann </PERSON>, director of research with the futures brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Allendale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, Ill. He said the opening dip in soybean futures triggered some technical sell signals, accelerating the market's decline. The January contract's drop below $ 5.83 a bushel was especially significant. `` A close below that level would turn funds into sellers and cause speculators to bail out,'' <PERSON> Biedermann </PERSON> said. Wheat futures were mixed and gaining, boosted by fading prospects for substantial rainfall today in the winter wheat belt and by Soviet purchases of wheat in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, an indication the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has re-entered the world grain market after an absence of about three weeks. In early trading, wheat futures were -RCB- cent lower to 1 \ cent higher with December at $ 4.08 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 \ cents lower with December at $ 2.36 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1 \ cents lower with December at $ 1.45 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 4 -LCB- cents to 5 \ cents lower with January at $ 5.81 Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .07 cent higher with December at 76.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .18 cent higher with November at 83.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent lower to .03 cent higher with December at 51.15 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .18 cent to .50 cent higher with February at 64.77 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled higher on Friday.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

 <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s largest bank, on Monday emerged as a `` white knight'' for <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> with a $ 1.48 billion takeover offer designed to stave off a hostile bid by <PERSON> Banque </PERSON> <PERSON> Indoquez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Analysts said the $ 8.56-a-share cash offer, which has the full backing of <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors, represented a premium over what the investment bank's stock was recently trading. <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> closed at $ 7.40 a share Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>; it had fallen as low as $ 4 a share earlier this year. The stock, though, rose sharply in price on Monday. `` It's a knock-out bid, one designed to forestall any notion that <PERSON> Indosuez </PERSON> could top it,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON>, a bank analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. Paris-based Indosuez, which already owns 14.9 percent of <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Grenfell </PERSON>, had no comment on <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s bid, a spokesman said But analysts said it was unlikely <PERSON> Indosuez </PERSON> will make a higher offer. Last month, British insurer <ORGANIZATION> Willis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> sold a 10.6 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> to Indosuez for $ 6.38 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indosuez </ORGANIZATION> says it seeks a 24.8 percent stake but needs <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> approval to own more than 15 percent. <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Faber </PERSON> shareholders were to meet Wednesday to decide whether to accept <ORGANIZATION> Indosuez </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 7.19-a-share offer for their remaining 9.8 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Faber </PERSON> appeared unlikely to sell unless <ORGANIZATION> Indosuez </ORGANIZATION> offered a higher price, and said it was considering suspending the meeting. In a joint statement, <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> said the British bank `` will operate as a separate legal entity within the <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> group and with a high degree of autonomy.'' Independent for 151 years, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Grenfell </PERSON> was known as the takeover king during the mid-1980s, playing a role in some of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s biggest mergers. But it failed in its ambition of becoming a fully integrated securities house, and pulled out of share-dealing a year ago, firing 450 employees. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Craven </PERSON>, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Grenfell </PERSON>'s chairman, and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s board of managing directors, stressed the mutual benefits of the deal. <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> will get <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION>'s strength in corporate finance and fund management, while strengthening its position in the British market. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> will benefit from the West German bank's distribution network and client base `` The acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> is an important step for <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which recognizes the pre-eminence of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market place within <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the fields of corporate finance and asset management,'' <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> said. `` We see the combination of the two organizations as an excellent fit. Together we will form an unrivaled and powerful team and give the enlarged <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> group a leading position in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.''

 The stock market churned ahead today, extending last week's rally amid hopes for lower interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 22.89 points last week, rose 5.34 to 2,680.89 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.

That development prompted Fed-watchers to conclude that the central bank had decided to become more aggressive in its efforts to cushion the impact of a slowing economy.

<HEAD>Judge Allows Braniff To Take Planes, But Airline Must Pay</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: SUBS final graf to CORRECT that GPA didn't disclose potential

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy judge has decided that <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s agreements to lease and buy new jets are valid, enabling the troubled airline to keep its most valuable asset. But the judge also ruled Saturday that <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> must pay $ 3 million to <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, an aircraft leasing company, by midnight Monday to keep five <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> A-320s the airline has ordered, and must pay for future planes within 60 days after delivery. By continuing to take delivery of 50 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> A-320s, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> will have a better chance to reorganize and operate under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, the airline's lawyers said. Otherwise, the Orlando-based carrier might be forced to cease operating entirely and sell its remaining asets. A trial ended Saturday in <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> that claimed the Irish company improperly canceled a lease agreement for 26 of the Airbuses. As a major creditor of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>, GPA is trying to retain the aircraft and protect itself from potential losses. While celebrating Judge <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>'s decision that the lease agreement remains in effect, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s lawyers acknowledged that the airline will pay dearly for its right to keep its lease and purchase contracts. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glassman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> lawyer representing <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>, said he did not know if the airline has enough money to meet Monday's deadline. If <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> fails to pay, GPA, which is leasing the five <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> jets, may sue the carrier in court to take possession of the jets. Since filing for protection from its creditors Sept. 28, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> has stopped flying and laid off most of its workers, who once totaled more than 4,800. The airline, which now employs about 275 people, is struggling to operate as a charter carrier. Airline analysts and experts view <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to continue receiving the 50 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> jets as the company's most valuable asset and best chance for a successful reorganization. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged that it has discussed with <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> the possibility of acquiring those planes. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> has been stymied, however, in its efforts to sublease the jets or sell its contracts for them. Just hours before the bankrupty filing, <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> canceled its agreement to lease 26 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> jets to the airline. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> sued GPA and several other companies involved in the leases for breach of contract, violation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy laws and other alleged business misconduct. Because the validity of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s lease and purchase contracts was disputed, the airline was thwarted in its efforts to reorganize under Chapter 11, <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> ruled. Lawyers representing <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> said the leasing company did not know whether it would appeal <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>'s decision. GPA, which is privately held, declined to disclose how much it could lose if <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> can not meet its financial obligations for the jets or find a substitute buyer.

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures closed lower Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, led by a steep soybean selloff linked to slack export demand and bearish technical signals. Soybean prices opened lower in reaction to weak demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybeans by European processors, partially reflecting the abundance of <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> palm oil, a soybean-oil competitor. The opening losses triggered technical sell signals, especially when the January soybean contract fell below the 55-day moving average of $ 5.83 a bushel, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Biedermann </PERSON>, director of research with the futures brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Allendale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` The technicals just really kicked in and we had fund and speculator selling all day long _ heavy liquidation,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers said Monday they were closer to reaching an oil production agreement for the first half of 1990. Sources said the proposal would raise <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s production by 1.5 million barrels to 22 million barrels a day and allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> to continue producing as it pleases. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> would give up part of their share to meet <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s demands for a bigger portion, while other countries' percentages would remain the same, the sources said Iranian oil minister <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said during a break from talks at <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s regular winter conference that the ministers were discussing a new idea, but he declined to elaborate. `` I think the atmosphere is good,'' <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> oil minister <PERSON> Ginandjar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kartasasmita </PERSON> said: `` Ideas are getting closer.'' <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s influential oil minister, <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> said, `` We will be continuing to meet.'' The oil markets decided to reserve judgment, analysts said. The spot price for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> Brent Blend, the most widely traded international crude oil, was $ 18.44 a barrel Monday afternoon, unchanged from late Friday. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, was down sharply in late afternoon trading with the near-term contract at $ 19.63 a barrel, down 19 cents from Friday. But analysts said the weakness was not necessarily OPEC-related. `` Traders on the whole have become more circumspect about an early analysis of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> trends, having been caught too many times by the whipsaw of seemingly contradictory statements by oil ministers,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gignoux </PERSON> who heads <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION>'s international energy desk in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Most of the 13 ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> met in a hotel room for several hours on Monday to see if they could resolve their differences. They also met in smaller groups during the day. The ministers gathered on Saturday for the opening of the conference and then met informally on Sunday, part of their normal strategy for establishing common ground. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has been grappling with demands from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> for larger shares of the group's total output. Most of the ministers seem to agree that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s current ceiling of 20.5 million barrels a day could be raised, since it would more realistically reflect the group's actual output. However, there are disputes about how large an increase there should be and how the extra output should be divided. Analysts estimate that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> actually is producing more than 23 million barrels a day. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> each are pumping double their quotas of 1.1 million barrels a day to press their demands for a higher share of the total. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> would be excluded from the deal now under consideration and would continue to produce what it wants, sources said. Prices have held at levels about 50 percent higher than a year ago, despite the increased supply, thanks to strong world demand and lower production by non-OPEC oil producers. Strong demand coupled with the fact that some members are producing at near capacity anyway, has eased the pressure for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> to solve its differences on quota allocations. If the ministers fail to take advantage of this absence of crisis to work out their problems, their choices are: striking a deal that is n't unanimous; giving all members an equal increase; or simply rolling over their current agreement. But these choices would only postpone a solution to cheating by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members and the oil markets likely would view any one of them as a sign of weakness. Such a market reaction, combined with the traditional slump in oil demand during the spring, could deeply depress prices.

 Costlier gold and labor drove up the cost of the gifts called for on the 12 days of Christmas this year, but who's counting when it's your true love? Those who ca n't afford $ 2,316 for the 10 lords-a-leaping, $ 15 for a partridge -LRB- the pear tree is $ 24.95 extra -RRB- or $ 1,000 each for a swimming swan probably should stick to `` White Christmas.'' Dreaming of something is cheaper. The cost of the 12 days as outlined in the popular carol rose almost $ 800 this year to $ 14,598.78, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Provident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. The 5.9 percent increase in the bank's seventh annual Christmas Price Index compared with a 4.8 percent increase in another CPI, the Consumer Price Index, the government's inflation gague. Since the gifts accumulate with each refrain into a shopping nightmare of 364 items, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said a lovestruck swain would have to spend $ 70,961.21 to buy the full carol. The bank turned to the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Zoo for the costs of the fowl, the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for the cost of the dancers per performance and the musicians union local chapter for the cost of a single show. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said seven of the 12 items remained stable at 1988 prices _ the partridge and pear tree, turtle doves, French hens, calling birds, geese-a-laying, swans-a-swimming and maids-a-milking. But <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> forgot to tell the gold market Christmas was coming. The cost of five gold rings this year, according to a local jewelry store, rose 20 percent over last year's $ 625. As in other service industries, prices for the leaping lords and ladies dancing waltzed up 16 percent to $ 2,316 and $ 2,084.40, respectively. `` This increase in Christmas service industry prices mirrors what's actually happening in parts of the economy in the service sector. As a result, we are seeing an influx of people into service industry jobs,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. Here are the prices for each of the daily gifts: _ One partridge in a pear tree, $ 39.95, unchanged from last year _ Two turtle doves, $ 50, unchanged _ Three French hens, $ 15, unchanged _ Four calling birds, $ 280, unchanged _ Five gold rings, $ 750, up from $ 625 _ Six geese-a-laying, $ 150, unchanged _ Seven swans-a-swimming, $ 7,000, unchanged _ Eight maids-a-milking, $ 26.80, unchanged _ Nine ladies dancing, $ 2,084.40, up from $ 1,800 _ 10 lords-a-leaping, $ 2,316, up from $ 2,000 _ 11 pipers piping, $ 905.58, up from $ 863.46 _ 12 drummers drumming, $ 981.05, up from $ 935.42

 Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks by the nation's biggest automakers fell 4.4 percent in mid-November from a year earlier, as declines by the Big Three continued pacing an industrywide slump, according to figures the companies released Monday. The automakers reported selling vehicles at an average daily rate of 31,032 during the Nov. 11-20 period, compared with 32,436 during the year-earlier period. Car sales were down 6.1 percent and light truck sales were off 1.8 percent. Car sales fell for the Big Three _ <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ while mid-November car sales for the other automakers were up. Overall, Big Three vehicle sales fell 8.6 percent from last year during the period. Car sales fell 12.4 percent and light truck sales were off 2.9 percent. The sales downturn began in early October, just as the 1990 model year got under way. Analysts predicted car purchasing in the fourth quarter would be substantially lower than in the third quarter because consumers rushed to showrooms in August and September to beat price increases on 1990 model cars and trucks. The vehicles hit dealerships en masse in early October. The continued slump may prompt the companies to further enhance their buyer incentives, such as rebates or low-interest loan. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> expanded its Oldsmobile dealer incentive program and boosted the incentive program on its Chevrolet cars and trucks. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> last week also sweetened the incentive package on its Eagle Premier cars. Through Nov. 20 this year, vehicle sales by the eight companies were 2.6 percent behind the pace of the same period last year. Car sales were down 3.6 percent and truck sales were 0.8 percent lower. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said sales of its cars and trucks were down 13 percent in mid-November, with car sales down 11.6 percent and truck sales off 14.8 percent. For the year through Nov. 20, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s vehicle sales were down 2.5 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s car and truck sales pace in mid-November was down 3.3 percent from the year-earlier period. A 12 percent drop in <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> car sales was offset by a 6 percent increase in light truck sales. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s year-to-date car and truck sales were 6.4 percent behind last year's pace. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said its mid-November car sales were down 13 percent while its truck sales were up 4.1 percent, combining for a 7.3 percent decline for all its vehicles during the period. For the year through Nov. 20, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s car and truck sales were down 5 percent from last year.

<HEAD>Fiat Signing Agreement to Manufacture Cars on Eve of Gorbachev Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TURIN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it will sign an agreement to build a new line of cars in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, an important step in President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plans to increase the supply of consumer goods. The Turin-based automobile giant said the joint venture agreement would be signed Tuesday, the eve of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s largest private industrial group and has produced cars in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since 1970. <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION>'s managing director, <PERSON> Cesare </PERSON> <PERSON> Romiti </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyjin </PERSON>, the Soviet minister for the automobile industry, were scheduled to sign a letter of intent for the project in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Tuesday. While financial details have not been released, analysts believe that <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will invest up to $ 1.4 billion. The plant will be built at <LOCATION> Elabung </LOCATION>, 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and is expected to turn out 300,000 automobiles a year when it begins operations between 1992 and 1993, according to industry sources. The output of the model, based on the popular <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panda </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, would be then increased to between 600,000 to 900,000 cars a year. Out of the first year's production, about a fourth would be sold on Western European markets, giving the Soviet side some return on its investment, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Other ageements between Italian and Soviet companies are expected to be signed during <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s three-day visit to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. Among the initiatives reported in the works are an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> to produce 10 million tires a year in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>; a plant for household electronic goods by the <PERSON> Merloni </PERSON> group; and a chemical and agro-industrial cooperation accord with the Montedison-Ferruzzi group. Italian officials said <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> will also offer its technology to help convert Soviet military industries into civilian ones. In 1966, <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> became one of the first Western groups to launch a major venture in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Togliattigrad auto plant, which began production of <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> 124 models in 1970, has contributed about half of all Soviet vehicles.

<HEAD>Eastern to Negotiate with Pilots Union</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Negotiators for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and the pilots union, which last week called off its strike, agreed Monday to meet for federally mediated talks. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said there was a preliminary meeting in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Monday, with a negotiating session planned Tuesday under the auspices of <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cognata </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Pilots union spokesman <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> called the session part of contract negotiations that have gone on sporadically since the pilots' contract became open to amendment more than a year ago. The pilots' walkout was officially a sympathy strike for the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, which went on strike after 1 -LCB- years of federally mediated talks stalemated. Eastern and the pilots have a major new difference to negotiate: how the 2,200 pilots who just ended their strike will get their jobs back, or whether they will get them back. A letter from <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s former striking pilots, to Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> last week said that while a return to work was `` unconditional,'' `` it is our position that all strikers should be reinstated promptly.'' The letter said former striking pilots should receive seniority and assignments in accordance with their contract. In a separate development Monday, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s aviation commissioner ordered striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> to vacate their `` tent city'' headquarters at <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> because of a rock-throwing incident in which a working Eastern employee was injured. Miami-based Eastern, which began rebuilding without its unions, said it has enough pilots _ 1,850 _ to operate its current schedule. Of those, about 1,000 were hired as replacements during the strike, and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> contends their jobs are protected against returning strikers. The two sides had been far apart on salary issues and work rule changes, although no current details were available Monday. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the concessions <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> wants from the pilots were considered essential for the airline's effort to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said the negotiations on returning union pilots to work will demonstrate the company's attitudes toward its workers. `` I think it would probably prevent possible litigation. It would indicate to everyone concerned that they really do want to rebuild Eastern with the most experienced people available,'' <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said. `` And it would indicate by actions rather than just words that they do want to work with labor groups. We've never seen any indications of that,'' he said. Eastern on Friday amended an August request that <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> clarify the rights of employees who are currently working and determine the rights of those who wish to return to work. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said no hearing date had been set. He said there are also tentative plans for negotiations this week between the company and the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents flight attendants at Eastern. The flight attendants followed the pilots last week in ending their sympathy strike, leaving only the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union on the picket lines. Under the Railway Labor Act, covering the airline industry and other transportation labor, contracts remain in force until federal mediation has been tried and fails, after which the union may strike and the company may impose its conditions. Eastern last June sought in bankruptcy court to have the pilots' contract invalidated, but then withdrew that request After direct talks broke down, the pilots in June requested federal mediation. There also were negotiations with the court-appointed bankruptcy examiner, attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>. Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days after the strike began March 4.

<TEXT>
 Energy futures prices fell in light trading Monday on what analysts described as a technical selloff. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the January contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, fell 19 cents to close at $ 19.63 a barrel. Contracts between February and June finished between 18 cents and 25 cents lower. Analysts said the market's weakness did not reflect events in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> is holding its semi-annual conference. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers completed their third day of negotiations Monday without reaching any conclusions on production limits, the issue dominating the talks. `` We have n't heard any specific OPEC-related news and the market's selloff did n't seem to be coordinated with news of the adjournment,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, manager of options and technical analysis for <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Refined oil products traded on the exchange also declined. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for December delivery lost 0.74 cent to 50.89 cents a barrel, while contracts for delivery between January and June ended 0.81 cent to 1.10 cents a gallon lower. No. 2 heating oil for December delivery slipped 0.49 cent to 60.92 cents a gallon, January lost 0.44 cent to 60.43 cents and February declined 0.43 cent to 58.75 cents a gallon. Analysts said the sparse volume was due partly to the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting. `` People are waiting to hear,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreis </PERSON>, energy broker with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>. `` Once we see a decision out of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> we'll see more activity.'' <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers are trying to decide whether to devise a new plan for allotting production shares according to each nation's ability to pump oil or simply to continue the current quota system.

<HEAD>Sales Down 4.4 Percent From Weak Period Last Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sales of new North American-made cars and trucks fell 4.4 percent in mid-November from the same period last year, automakers reported Monday in the latest indication of their industry's weakness. The industry's lengthening sales slump _ which has been paced by the Big Three of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ could mean automakers will lengthen their year-end factory shutdowns in an attempt to trim production and deflate an inventory backlog, analysts said. The eight major companies making cars and light trucks in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> said they sold an average of 31,032 vehicles daily during the Nov. 11-20 period, compared with a daily rate of 32,466 during year-earlier period. Car sales dropped 6.1 percent while light truck sales fell 1.8 percent during the period. For the Big Three, overall vehicle sales were down 8.6 percent from last year during the 10-day period. Through Nov. 20 of this year, car and truck sales from all U.S.-based manufacturers were 2.6 percent behind last year's pace. Car sales were down 3.6 percent and truck sales were off 0.8 percent during the year-to-date period The industry's sales slide began in early October, as automakers ushered in the 1990 model year with higher prices. Analysts said Monday they expected automakers to consider cutting production rather than piling on more rebates or other customer incentives to help sell cars and trucks. `` We're at a point in the cycle where production cuts make more sense,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirnan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said automakers might look at extending holiday shutdowns to reduce production. `` It would dramatize to the feds the need for lower interest rates and to the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> how important it is to be sane in their demands,'' <PERSON> Kirnan </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union and the Big Three automakers open contract talks this summer over replacing the pacts that expire at midnight Sept. 14, 1990. The automakers have been wrestling with bloated inventories since early this year, trying to shrink them with dealer and customer incentives and short-term plant shutdowns. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> staged a large demonstration at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> headquarters to protest the company's scheduled February closing of a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> assembly plant and the laying off of 1,700 employees. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said its car and truck sales pace was down 13 percent in mid-November, with car sales off 11.6 percent and truck sales off 14.8 percent. For the year through Nov. 20, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s vehicle sales were down 2.5 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s car and truck sales pace was down 3.3 percent in mid-November from the same time last year. A 12 percent drop in its car sales was offset by a 6 percent increase in its light truck sales. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s year-to-date car and truck sales were down 6.4 percent from last year. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> said its mid-November car sales were down 13 percent while its truck sales were up 4.1 percent, combining for a 7.3 percent decline for its vehicles during the period. For the year, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s car and truck sales were down 5 percent from last year.

<HEAD>Critics Say IBM's Radiation Reduction Is Halfway Measure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A move by <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to reduce the electromagnetic radiation emitted by computer displays does not go far enough, some critics said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> was praised for taking the lead in reducing very low frequency radiation, but several advocates of radiation reduction said the company had neglected to do anything about the extremely low frequency spectrum. `` This move of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s is partial at best, and I think is a public relations stunt at worst,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodeur </PERSON>, author of a newly published book on electromagnetic radiation, `` Currents of Death.'' <PERSON> Brodeur </PERSON> said the government and private industry should work strenuously to cut electromagnetic radiation at 60 cycles a second, the range associated with power lines. He argues it can cause leukemia and brain cancer. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it did not do anything about the 60 hertz radiation because customers had not asked for it. The company argues there is no evidence that radiation from computer displays is a health hazard. Scientific studies have been contradictory. `` We do n't have any active work right now'' on 60 hertz radiation, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Snayd </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s VDT and <ORGANIZATION> Ergonomics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview. `` We have not visited it at all.'' <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> in September introduced a line of InfoWindow terminals for mid-sized and mainframe computers that give off less electromagnetic radiation in the 15 kilohertz to 17 kilohertz range, categorized as very low frequency. The reduced-radiation feature of the terminals was included in response to requests from customers in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, not because of health concerns, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said. The terminals were promoted as low-radiation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but not in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where press materials made no mention of the radiation issue. <PERSON> Snayd </PERSON> said the radiation-reduction feature probably will be introduced in future displays for personal computers. Some analysts expect that to happen next year. No other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer makers have said they plan to follow <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s lead in radiation reduction. <PERSON> Brodeur </PERSON> faulted <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> for implying the terminals were low in radiation when in fact they deal with only one portion of the spectrum. But <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s Snayd countered that the company had not billed them as low radiation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at all. `` When and if we do we'll be very precise about their characteristics,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> union has been leading the fight for controls on radiation from video display terminals. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisen </PERSON>, the research and information director, praised <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s radiation reduction. `` This is certainly a salutary development, and certainly something the unions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> have been calling for for the last four years,'' <PERSON> Eisen </PERSON> said. But he added, `` It would be far better if they were shielding in the -LRB- 60 hertz -RRB- frequencies as well and I see no reason they should not be shielding for both.'' Electromagnetic radiation from computer displays is different from and less dangerous than the ionizing radiation of gamma rays and X-rays.

Company officials said the protection plan was not in response to any attempt at an acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>. The plan would take effect if anyone acquired 10 percent of the company's stock without management's approval.

By discouraging abusive tactics, the plan promotes the fair and equal treatment of all shareholders,'' <PERSON> Clendenin </PERSON> said. Under the plan, if any person or group acquires 10 percent of the company's stock without prior board approval, other shareholders then would be allowed to buy <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> common stock at half price _ thus diluting the holdings of the potential buyer.

 The stock market followed through on its Thanksgiving-week rally with another advance Monday as traders debated the chances for lower interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 22.89 points last week, rose another 19.42 to 2,694.97. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 883 up, 612 down and 489 unchanged. The market began to rise last week on signs that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was takeing steps for the second time this month to relax its credit policy. That development prompted Fed-watchers to conclude that the central bank had decided to become more aggressive in its efforts to cushion the impact of a slowing economy. The new trading week began amid talk of impending reductions in major banks' prime lending rates. There was also conjecture that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> might make its intentions clearer before long by cutting the discount rate, the charge it imposes on loans to private financial institutions. That optimism faded a bit in Monday's activity, however, when <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> dealings in the credit markets suggested that it was n't as eager to push rates lower as had been presumed over the weekend. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> climbed 3 \ to 68 \ in active The company said it would create a leveraged employee stock ownership plan financed with borrowings of about $ 1 billion. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> gained 1 \ to 61 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> said it was a buyer of its shares as part of a recently announced $ 10 billion repurchase program slated over the next five years.

<HEAD>Dollar, Gold Mostly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar fell sharply against most major foreign currencies Monday as traders anticipated a further decline in interest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Gold prices also were mostly lower. `` The psychology is definitely bearish for the dollar and bullish for the -LRB- West German -RRB- mark,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a vice president for foreign exchange at <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Traders expected interest rates to fall in this country in response to a slowing economy, and to rise in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> because of the continuing political changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. A nation's currency tends to follow the direction of its interest rates. Lower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rates make the dollar less attractive, while higher West German yields make the mark a better investment. The dollar's downward trend is expected to remain in place in the next few weeks unless the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration issues new statistics indicating strength in the economy, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. When the economy is stronger, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is more likely to nudge interest rates higher to prevent it from overheating. Traders will be watching as the government issues several economic reports this week, including third quarter gross national product figures and personal income, construction spending and the Index of Leading Indicators for October. Overseas dealers also said they expected the dollar to drop further. `` As long as there are n't any major surprises from the interest rate side, I expect the dollar to move lower under fluctuations,'' said a dealer at a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> bank. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.7890 West German marks, down from 1.8010; 1.6040 Swiss francs, down from 1.6095; 6.1100 French francs, down from 6.1415; 1.16665 Canadian dollars, down from 1.6725; and 1,320.75 Italian lire, down from 1,326.75 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.7900 West German marks, down from 1.8040; 1.6050 Swiss francs, down from 1.6145; 6.1125 French francs, down from 6.1600; 2.0203 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0340; 1,321.25 Italian lire, down from 1,333.75; and 1.1670 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1665 In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to a closing 143.35 Japanese yen from 143.80 yen at Friday's close.

<BYLINE>Gold Prices Plunge on Profit-Taking ^By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Gold prices plummeted Monday amid heavy profit-taking by speculators as the market broke a five-day runup that had pushed the metal to its highest levels in almost a year. On other commodity markets, cotton futures plunged the permitted daily limit; soybeans were down sharply; energy futures retreated; and livestock and meat futures were mixed. Gold futures settled $ 5.20 to $ 6.10 lower on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in December down $ 5.20 at $ 414.10 a troy ounce Silver fell 18.7 cents to 20.7 cents with December settling at $ 5.693 a troy ounce. Monday's sell-off was the steepest daily decline in gold prices since Aug. 4 and the most significant drop since the market began climbing sharply about six weeks ago from levels near $ 360 an ounce. Analysts said gold had been due for a correction after climbing so hard, so fast and many remained bullish. `` The trend remains intact,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, metals analyst with the futures brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But they said gold easily could fall a bit further before resuming its climb, which has been based largely on investment buying stemming from the uncertain economic outlook, the volatile stock market and worries about the rapid rate of political change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. There were no solidly bearish developments Monday to prompt the gold sell-off, so observers concluded the selling reflected profit-taking by players who had ridden the market up since mid-October. `` I do n't think we're finished yet with the rally in gold or silver,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` It's healthy for the market not to overextend itself.'' Most cotton futures prices fell the daily limit of 2 cents a pound on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in a sell-off inspired almost entirely by technical sell signals in the absence of fresh supply-and-demand news. The trigger was the March contract's drop below the September low of 72.20 cents early in the session, said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, a cotton analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` When it came close to it, frantic, panicky selling developed,'' he said. Cotton settled 1.75 cents to 2.33 cents lower with March at 71.08 cents a pound; and the December contract, which has no limit pending expiration, down 2.33 cents at 67.72 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures finished mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, led by a steep soybean sell-off linked to slack export demand and bearish technical signals. The wheat market closed narrowly mixed, with support stemming from <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuetter </PERSON>'s statement that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s sale of 1.3 million metric tons of wheat to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was `` an encouraging sign'' that the Soviets were back in the market for wheat. Wheat settled 1 \ cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with December at $ 4.06 -RCB- a bushel; corn futures were 3 -LCB- cents to 4 -RCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.33 \ a bushel; oats were 3 -LCB- cents to 4 cents lower with December at $ 1.43 a bushel; soybeans were 6 -LCB- cents to 11 cents lower with January at $ 5.76 \ Technical factors also were cited for Monday's moderate decline in energy futures prices on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .08 cent to .25 cent lower with January at $ 19.63 a barrel; heating oil was .29 cent to .58 cent lower with December at 60.92 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .74 cent to 1 cent lower with December at 50.89 cents a gallon. Livestock and meat futures were narrowly mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .17 cent lower to .05 cent higher with December at 75.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .05 cent higher with November at 83.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .60 cent lower to .03 cent higher with December at 50.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .22 cent lower to .35 cent higher with February at 64.55 cents a pound.

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it was seeking to oust the board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nekoosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has advised shareholders to reject <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 3.6 billion buyout offer <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> stated it was soliciting shareholder consents for a special meeting at which <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would vote on whether to remove the board. `` It's clearly time to let <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders speak for themselves, since their board obviously does not speak for them,'' <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said in a statement released through his <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> headquarters. In a separate move, <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> filed motions Monday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seeking to force a Great Northern shareholders meeting to be moved up from March to within the next 30 days. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> also sought to force Great Northern to disclose to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> any steps it might be taking to alter its financial structure and make a takeover more difficult. Great Northern's board on Nov. 21 recommended that stockholders reject <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s sweetened buyout offer of $ 63 a share, or about $ 3.6 billion total. Great Northern also had rejected <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s initial offer of $ 58 a share, a total of about $ 3.1 billion. Great Northern stock rose 12 -LCB- cents to $ 61.62 -LCB- a share Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> rose 37 -LCB- cents to $ 47.62 -LCB- a share. Great Northern, based in <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and incorporated in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, has refused to negotiate with <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> over either offer, calling the proposed buyout financially dangerous and illegal under antitrust law. The company issued a news release from its headquarters calling <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s court motions `` entirely meritless'' and self-serving and said it would contest them in court. The stepped-up attack on Great Northern came a day before <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> was to meet in <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> with Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> officials have sought assurances from both companies that the merger fight would not cost any state residents their jobs or put valuable woodlands in the hands of developers. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> has made no promises, saying that because he does not have access to Great Northern's inside information on its <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> holdings, he can not say for sure what <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> will do if it wins the takeover battle. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s effort to have shareholders oust <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION>'s directors is separate from the federal court action. Under <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> law, if at least one-third of the shareholders seek a special meeting for voting on removal of the directors, the meeting must be called within 60 days. The court papers ask that a separate shareholders meeting already scheduled for March 20 be moved up to within the next 30 days, so shareholders can go ahead and vote on the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> offer. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, in asking for disclosure of any plans by <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> to change its financial structure, also seeks to force Great Northern to provide 72 hours notice before it makes such changes. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s motion stated that <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> shareholders could suffer irreparable harm if the court did not prevent the company's management from taking further steps to either prevent a takeover or restructure Great Northern.

<HEAD>Stockholder Seeks Support To Dump UAL Board</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stockholder said Monday he had proposed a shareholder resolution demanding the resignation of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors, contending they were not acting in the best interests of the company. Professor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>, a transportation law expert from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION>, said he had asked <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board to include the proposed resolution in the proxy statement for the airline company's annual meeting next spring. <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>'s demand is another sign of discontent among <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, who saw the price of their shares skyrocket several months ago on takeover overtures only to plummet following a failed buyout attempt by pilots and management of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The investor group <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> already is asking <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> shareholders to support its efforts to oust most <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> board members and replace them with directors who would put the company up for sale or engage in some other transaction to boost shareholder value. <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> contends that <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s directors have become greedy and should be replaced or forced to take steep pay cuts and lose some of their self-awarded perquisites. `` I'm less concerned with increasing shareholder value in terms of trying to find another buyout than I am with getting the company back to running an airline and focused on trying to shore up their market position,'' <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> said in a telephone interview in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where he is a visiting professor at <ORGANIZATION> DePaul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>'s complaints include the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> board's decisions in August and September to award themselves `` golden parachute'' severance plans consisting of $ 20,000-a-year lifetime salaries and unlimited first-class travel benefits for themselves and their spouses. The board members would have received the benefits whether or not they continued to serve on the board after the planned pilot-management buyout. The benefits were revoked when the deal collapsed in October due to a lack of bank financing for the $ 6.75 billion bid. <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> also attacked <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, who stood to gain more than $ 76 million if the deal had gone through. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> declined to comment on <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>'s demands He said <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s next annual meeting had not been scheduled, but the meeting usually is held in April. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s stock fell 87 -LCB- cents to $ 168.75 a share Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>, who has written several books critical of airline deregulation, said he has owned 100 shares of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> for several years. His ownership of more than $ 1,000 worth of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> stock qualifies him to propose a shareholder resolution, according to <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> rules. Under the rules, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> must publish the resolution in its proxy statement unless it can persuade the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> that it fails to meet certain technical requirements, such as word limits and the timing of the filing of the proposal. <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> said he expects <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> to raise objections to his proposal. He said such resolutions usually are defeated by shareholder votes if they make it into proxy statements. But <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> said he hopes to succeed by tapping the dissatisfaction of other shareholders. `` It's a way to get an issue on the front burner of a corporation and embarrass some board members and get them to act responsibly, and that is what I'm trying to do with this,'' <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The failing <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON> department store chain on Monday abandoned a plan to reorganize under federal bankruptcy law and said it would seek to sell all its assets. The reversal came just four months after the century-old regional department store sought Chapter 11 protection from creditors and sought to reorganize as a smaller company. `` Certainly everybody in the company is disappointed,'' President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokely </PERSON> told a news conference at the company's flagship store in downtown <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> <PERSON> Stokely </PERSON> said the chain filed a plan in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that `` contemplates the sale of all assets.'' He said the company's `` current circumstances and financial condition led the board of directors to conclude that a reorganization as a profitable going concern is not feasible.'' Under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, a company can function under court protection while it devises a way to pay its bills. <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON> had 14 stores in July when it filed for bankruptcy court protection. Since then, the company has begun arrangements to rid itself of six of its less profitable stores, including one in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.

 Legislators approved major concessions from the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> on Monday, granting the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> republics the right to issue their own currency and take a share of profits from centrally controlled factories. After four months' work, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> gave final approval to a plan launching <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> on the road to economic autonomy from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> beginning Jan. 1. In other action, the legislators gave preliminary approval to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s first law explicitly repudiating years of press censorship. Deputies from the tiny Baltic republic of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> smiled, stood and cheered after the legislature approved the economic independence measure on a vote of 296-67. Thirty-seven deputies abstained. `` It's a very big step forward,'' <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Algirdas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON> said in an interview after the vote. Estonian legislator <PERSON> Mihail </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronshtein </PERSON>, an economist, called the vote a `` big victory'' for his republic. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who presided at the debate, also had praise. `` We need such a law to move us forward on the road to economic reform,'' he told more than 400 legislators who had gathered in the Kremlin. His chief economic adviser, deputy Premier <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> would be taking `` brave radical'' steps and blasted opponents for a `` presumption of guilt'' that the republics would take advantage of the law to the detriment of the rest of the country. He said the government had made several major concessions in giving up some control of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION>' economies that have been under <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s jurisdiction since the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> takeover of the independent states in 1940. The law says natural resources in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION>, long plundered by Moscow-controlled ministries, are to be used `` in the interests of the republics and the union.'' Baltic legislators said this meant the republics will have the prerogative on how resources are used. Control of the republics' financial system is to be in the hands of independent <ORGANIZATION> republican </ORGANIZATION> banks, except for branches of the Soviet national bank. <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> said that provision meant the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> could develop their own currency for use within the republics, although they would still be required to use the ruble in dealing with the rest of the country. Politicians and economists in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> are considering setting up their own currencies because the value of the ruble has plunged, but they indicated the time is not yet ripe to take such a radical step. One deputy said the provision would allow the republics to create their own `` separate fiefdoms.'' The law also gives the republics a say over how the incomes of businesses on its territory is spent, and legislators said this meant the republics would get half of their profits. Control of pipelines and highways running through the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> is to be decided on agreement of the central government and the republics, but <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> said such items would remain in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s hands A final vote on the bill had been delayed from Friday after a sharp debate on whether the move amounted to a renewal or an effort to tear apart the Soviet system. A deputy from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Danilyuk </PERSON>, said Friday he opposed the bill because `` I would not like to become a participant in the disintegration of our great state.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Friday the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> can move toward economic independence under the new law only within the framework of the federation, and all 15 republics will be allowed to have such status in 1991. The law was given preliminary approval in July and sent to legislative committees for further work. The press law, which goes to committees for further work, declares that `` the press and other mass media are free. Censorship of the mass media is not permitted.'' Mass media can be owned and operated by `` government and social organizations, work collectives, creative unions, religious, cooperative and other groupings of citizens of the U.S.S.R,'' it said, greatly loosening the traditionally tight control of the media. It says distribution of materials revealing state secrets, calling for violence or overthrow of the government, or containing `` propaganda of war, racial, nationalistic, religious exclusivity or intolerance,'' and pornography can be banned by a prosecutor. The Soviet press traditionally has been on a tight rein, and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials frequently have pressured editors to keep unfavorable materials out. Even before the law was passed, however, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s glasnost policy of openness made many subjects no longer taboo. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last month met with newspaper editors and accused them of giving the impression the country was on the brink of disaster, hurting his reform effort. He reportedly demanded the firing of at least one editor, who nevertheless remains at work.

The report represents an amalgamation of previously issued statistics regarding consumer spending, retail sales and wholesale prices for the immediately preceding months.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar was lower against the Japanese yen Tuesday morning, while the key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> fell marginally. The dollar, which opened at 143.33 yen, down 0.02 yen from Monday's finish here, ended morning trading at 143.45 yen. It ranged from 143.33 to 143.47 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 major issues lost a marginal 9.70 points, or 0.03 percent, ending the morning session at 36,871.83. The index was a 397.6-points gainer Monday, attaining a record 36,881.53 close. The index was lower since the opening because market players were afraid of a rapid rise in share prices following the hefty gain the previous day, securities dealers said. <PERSON> Satoru </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagayoshi </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, attributed the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION>'s slight loss to technical sellings by <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` Trading was active,'' he said, mainly because the yen has been stable on the foreign exchange market. Meanwhile, in exchange dealings, the dollar-yen rate moved narrowly as market players stepped to the sidelines after a similar wait-and-see mood in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said a trader with the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The yen remained higher against the dollar as participants bought it by selling the West German mark for profit-taking, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The mark has been stronger than almost any other major currency after the recent reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Since many market players, who expect <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will be the major beneficiary of the movements in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, still have a large demand for the West German currency, technical selling of the mark against the yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> `` will last only temporarily,'' said the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> trader. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> said Tuesday that the central bank will conduct concerted intervention if the market continues to fluctuate excessively, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported.
