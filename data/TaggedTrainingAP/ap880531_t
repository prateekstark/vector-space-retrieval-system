<HEAD>ADL Reports Upswing in Israel-Related Anti-Semitism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There has been a sharp rise in anti-Semitic incidents that stem from opposition to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Defamation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> of B'nai B'rith reported Tuesday. So far this year, 88 out of 443 anti-Semitic incidents reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have had an element of anti-Israeli sentiment, according to a report by the <ORGANIZATION> ADL </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors outbreaks of racism and anti-Semitism. By contrast, there were only three such incidents out of 1,018 anti-Semitic episodes reported for all of last year. This year's anti-Israeli incidents appeared to be prompted by Palestinian unrest in the occupied territories, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> ADL </ORGANIZATION> report said. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON>, the group's national director, said the incidents represented `` the first time since the founding of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> 40 years ago that there has been a significant outbreak of Middle East-related anti-Semitic incidents in this country.'' The incidents included vandalism and arson attacks on synagogues, telephone threats to Jewish organizations and other forms of verbal harassment. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> led all states in reports of politically motivated anti-Semitism with 12 vandalism cases and 13 harassment incidents, followed by <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> ADL </ORGANIZATION> said. The figures are based on reports gathered by the <ORGANIZATION> ADL </ORGANIZATION>'s 31 regional offices.

 A luckless man has been charged with a string of robberies in which he took 1,500 lottery tickets in hopes of winning the jackpot, police said. <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, 20, did n't get the $ 1 million winner. He did get booked on charges of armed robbery and grand theft in connection with three separate robberies of 7-Eleven stores last week, police said Monday. `` He did n't take cash, he did n't take food, he did n't take anything but the lottery tickets,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> detective <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robson </PERSON>. The robberies occurred Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday mornings at two different 7-Elevens, police said. In each case, the robber, who brandished a gun in the first robbery, fled in a black Cadillac, they said. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, unarmed, was arrested Friday night after an officer spotted a black <PERSON> Cadillac </PERSON> at the first 7-Eleven that had been robbed, police said.

 Political disorders, ethnic tensions, poverty and international disputes are churning up the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seas </LOCATION> in an arc curving sharply northward from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and back down to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tahiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, even <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> themselves, have had a taste of trouble in the past year. Most recently it was rioting in <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION> over land claims, and in the French territory of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> 19 native Kanaks were killed in a shootout with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> troops in ethnic and political disorders. <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> has seen two coups in the past year, and the former British island remains unstable in the aftermath. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is concerned about what it sees as the speading influence of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> in the area and the inroads made by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in what long has been seen as an `` American lake.'' A commentator in the <ORGANIZATION> Sydney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said the image of a South Seas paradise may have been permanently tarnished. The past year also has seen riots in <LOCATION> Tahiti </LOCATION> and political upheaval in <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> over the alleged corruption of Cabinet ministers. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> faces racial unrest as indigenous Maoris press the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government of Prime Minister <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> with a battery of land and fisheries claims. In <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, aborigines are using this year's bicentennial celebrations to highlight grievances they say grew out of European settlement 200 years ago. In early May, bloody violence erupted over territorial and French presidential elections in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, culminating in the rescue of French hostages held in caves by Melanesian separatists; 21 people were killed. On May 16, a drunken mob ran riot through <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vila </LOCATION>, looting shops and smashing office windows. One man died, nine others were injured and police arrested 30 people in the rioting over land claims. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> responded to the crisis by airlifting riot-control gear to <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION> at Prime Minister <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lini </PERSON>'s request Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> linked <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to the rioting and said <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> could not stand by as a friendly country's government is undermined by what he called a non-democratic process. `` There is no doubt about a <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> connection in <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said. `` In a city with a population of less than 20,000 it is clear that these disturbances have been on a very serious scale.'' <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>, formerly the <LOCATION> British-French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hebrides </LOCATION>, shocked the generally pro-Western <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> with its decision in 1986 to establish diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Since then, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has sought fishing agreements with <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> and impoverished <LOCATION> Kiribati </LOCATION>, creating concern in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> about Soviet inroads in the region. More recently, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has approached <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> for fishing access to Australian ports for refueling purposes and to Australian airports for fishing crews in transit. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said he would treat the request with caution. Elsewhere in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, such nations as <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION> face poverty, overcrowding and unemployment. Many of the islanders have migrated to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> in search of jobs. `` All these are turning the once tranquil <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> into an increasingly complex set of real and potential troublespots,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Sydney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Sydney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> echoed that concern, calling the situation a powderkeg. `` The multiple problems of these islands has led to a rising discontent,'' the Telegraph said. `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has been making big efforts to gain a stronger foothold in every island group through fishery deals and aid.'' Racial and ethnic divisions remain a major underlying problem of many <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> islands, where populations are mainly Melanesian. <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> are examples. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is the major power in the region and its largest aid donor. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> has expressed concern about Libyan activities, going as far as to close down <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s diplomatic mission in <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION> last year after an incident involving the aboriginal activist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mansell </PERSON> had returned from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> saying <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> was prepared to bankroll a black revolution in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The scattered violence in the South Seas has no single connective thread, although in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polynesia </LOCATION> the crises erupted after <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> refused to follow the regional pattern of decolonization and independence. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> already suffers a major image problem in the South Seas with the bombing of the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> vessel Rainbow Warrior in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> in 1985 and its continued underground nuclear testing on the Mururoa atoll over the objections of almost every island state in the region. The island states, supported by <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, have declared the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> a nuclear-free zone. In a major turnaround, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1986 designated the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> an area of concern because of a buildup of the Soviet Pacific fleet. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe the Soviet fleet consists of 755 ships and patrol craft, including 141 submarines.

<HEAD>Welfare Recipients Become Entrepreneurs in Pilot Projects</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A program targeted at low-income women in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> is helping welfare recipients create their own jobs and build successful businesses, and promoters hope its success will spread to the rest of the country. `` A lot of people told me this was going to fail miserably,'' said <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeley </PERSON>, president of the 5-year-old Women's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which was graduating its first class of 18 fledgling entrepreneurs today Under the plan, welfare recipients receive training and then continue receiving public assistance while receiving subsidized loans to help them start businesses ranging from cleaning companies to hair-styling salons. `` The first hurdle we had to cross in this area was skepticism. Can poor women do it?'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. The organization began its first class for welfare entrepreneurs in March under the federal Self Employment Investment Demonstration. <PERSON> Keeley </PERSON> said she hopes 90 people will graduate by the end of the year. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> is the first of five states to launch the program, which is coordinated by the private, nonprofit <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said. The other states are <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The corporation persuaded federal officials to waive regulations which reduce or eliminate benefits when recipients get jobs, <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said. Participants continue receiving assistance even after they start their own businesses so they can re-invest profits. At the Women's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, recipients devise a business plan, learn about marketing, financial management and other skills and are encouraged to start thinking like entrepreneurs. They can borrow up to $ 5,000, to be loaned in small increments as their businesses progress at 1 percent above the prime lending rate, said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON>, who directs the organization's pilot project known as the Self Employment Training Opportunities Program. Once a month for at least a year, recipients are required to work with the organization's accountant to do bookkeeping. `` The whole point of that is to get them off on the right foot,'' Ms. <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> said. Women's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> received nearly all its current annual budget of $ 600,000 from foundations and other private sources, Ms. <PERSON> Keeley </PERSON> said. Organizers hope to help other states begin similar projects, she said. An aspiring filmmaker, one of the few men to complete the program, said welfare recipients face challenges other entrepreneurs do n't. `` Most of us who have been down and out have had our self-esteem shattered. They realized it was important to build that up,'' he said of the program, asking not to be identified for fear it might hurt his business. Promoters point out that the program is n't a cure-all for welfare problems. `` People get poor for different reasons. They are going to escape in different ways,'' <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> reasoned. Only 10 percent to 15 percent of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s 57,000 AFDC recipients are likely candidates for the program, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, planning director for the state Office of Jobs Policy. Nationally, the percentage is 2 percent to 5 percent, he said. A forerunner to the current program was launched three years ago. In that time, 22 women started businesses and three have already repaid their loans, Ms. <PERSON> Keeley </PERSON> said. `` They do n't hand the business to you. You have to work for it,'' said <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, who has cleaned homes and businesses most of her life and started a janitorial service in late 1986. `` They give you the right contacts. If you do n't follow through, it's your fault.'' Ms. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, who had been on and off assistance for 30 years, is self-supporting now and employs about 10 people. `` I'm glad I'm off Welfare makes you feel depressed and down,'' she said. Before the pilot program ends in 1992, <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> hopes to persuade federal officials to waive permanently regulations that bar welfare recipients who turn a business profit from keeping their benefits while they get their companies off the ground. `` We need the federal government to let go a little to let it succeed,'' <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said. `` I must say the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> has been very cooperative, but right now the waiver process is onerous.''

 When Lt. Gov. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> was growing up in this former Confederate capital, he waited on tables at political dinners in the city's segregated clubs and hotels. Next year, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> could land a job in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s Executive Mansion as the host of such dinners _ and the nation's first elected black governor. The 57-year-old <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, whose grandparents were slaves, already is the highest-ranking black elected state official in the country. Although he has not yet announced his candidacy, he would be the favorite to win the Democratic nomination for governor next summer. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozell </PERSON>, a political scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fredericksburg </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> has no strong opposition within the party and, among potential <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> opponents next November, only Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trible </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> seems at this point to pose a major threat to <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s election. <PERSON> Trible </PERSON> is not seeking re-election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this year and has not said whether he will run for governor in 1989. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, the youngest of eight children, grew up in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. He studied chemistry at <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, then enlisted in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and won a <ORGANIZATION> Bronze </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> for bravery in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. He went to law school at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and opened a law practice here in 1959. Ten years later, he ran for a <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vacancy when other local black leaders showed no interest. He became the first black to sit in the chamber since Reconstruction. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> was recognized as a skilled debater who quickly learned the rules of parliamentary procedure. Although his early image was that of a firebrand, he was never considered a militant. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> was instrumental in the state's adoption of a holiday honoring slain civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. He also lobbied unsuccessfully to change lyrics that blacks found offensive in the state song, `` Carry Me Back to <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> combined the role of maverick with that of an insider. In 1982, he single-handedly scuttled the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ambition of fellow Democrat <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON> because <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON> dared to invoke the name of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s conservative leader, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator who left the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1970 to become an independent. The Byrd organization had dominated the state for 50 years. Two years later, in July 1984, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> announced for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor. No serious opposition arose within the party during the next year, and he was nominated in June 1985. When <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Democrats also nominated a woman for attorney general, there were predictions that the party was headed for disaster. But <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> played down his race and offered the image of a moderate native son in the tradition of then-Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>. A combination of <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>'s popularity, mistakes by <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opponent and a tour of the state by <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> helped turn the predicted disaster into the second straight Democratic sweep of the state's top three offices. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s performance in the administration of Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, who can not by law succeed himself, has been mostly low-key. However, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> engaged in a well-publicized feud with <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> during his first year in office over how much credit <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> deserved for the 1985 victory. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> also has criticized the administration's tax increases for road construction and made a show this year of pushing, over <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>' objections, for a repeal of the sales tax on over-the-counter drugs. The lieutenant governor's major prospective competitor for the gubernatorial nomination stepped aside in March when Attorney General <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> announced that she would seek another term in office. <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> acknowledged this month in a college commencement address that <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> could make history next year by becoming the first black to lead the state's Democratic ticket. <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>' office said no endorsement was intended, but observers said the comment amounted to a warning to potential rivals to stay out of <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s way. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> is expected to announce his political plans this summer. According to <PERSON> Rozell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s race may not prevent him from becoming governor of the Old Dominion because of changes over the past 20 years in the state's population and its attitudes. About 20 percent of Virginians are black, and the state also has a large, progressive-minded population in the northern corridor adjoining the nation's capital. No black has ever been elected governor in this country. In 1986 <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' Democratic Mayor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, a Republican county executive in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, both were nominated by their parties but lost the election. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> also had failed in his first race for governor in 1982. The only black to serve as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor was <PERSON> Pinckney </PERSON> B.S. <PERSON> Pinchback </PERSON>, the lieutenant governor of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> who became acting governor for six weeks in 1872-1873 after the governor was impeached.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lack of an alternative to military rule, and a protest movement so well-mannered it apparently is no threat, have stymied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attempts to force Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power. For his part, the general uses the populist appeal that has characterized 20 years of de facto military rule and deflects the spotlight from himself. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> says the issue is not whether he stays or goes, but <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s dignity and self-determination. This plays well in a country that knows it was created in 1903 essentially for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s convenience and where a new nationalism sparked by the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties burns brightly. In mid-May, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> consolidated support in the military by forming a <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of 20 loyal officers. The council, most of whose members are from the middle ranks, appears to be at least on par with the senior officers who serve as chiefs of staff. Allegations of drug-running and of involvement in the decapitation murder of opposition figure <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Spadafora </PERSON>, which spurred the movement to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> a year ago, have all but evaporated as issues among Panamanians. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> engineered the departures of dictators during the past decade in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by convincing them that their positions were untenable and they could not expect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help against popular uprisings. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> clearly does not feel threatened by his opposition, which comes from the genteel, educated middle and upper classes rather than oppressed masses. It is an uprising with good manners, a rare phenomenon in Central America. While dissidents in other countries form guerrilla armies, Panamanians bang pots and pans, wave white handkerchiefs and hold brief general strikes. `` If you want to see Panamanians dead in the streets of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, you will not see it,'' deposed President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> said in a recent meeting with reporters. `` Panamanians have risked as far as they are willing to risk.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has shut down opposition news media. His soldiers, who can crack heads with the best of them when the occasion arises, have blocked most street demonstrations with intimidation or force. Panamanian life is permeated by a `` them or us'' attitude that pits workers against the wealthy opposition, a small and struggling <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> against the Colossus of the North, and Panamanian independence against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meddling. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> popularized the term `` rabi-blancos,'' which translates roughly to `` white butts,'' a reference to the lighter skin common to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s upper classes. In a recent speech the general said `` the establishment,'' as he has taken to calling the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, will be responsible if anything untoward happens to him. American economic sanctions have lowered the comparatively high living standard of many Panamanians but made no visible dent in <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s control. He has rejected the legitimacy of federal indictments in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> charging him with drug trafficking and money laundering. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> appeared to be negotiating on different levels _ the Panamanians wanting to talk about economic issues and American troop withdrawals, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is willing to discuss only dropping the indictments in exchange for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> says he will not respond to ultimatums and will not deal until sanctions are lifted and the additional American soldiers troops sent to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in April are pulled out. The troops and sanctions remain in place. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> says that, early in the talks, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators gave him 48 hours to be out of his country. Although Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said last week the talks had broken off, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying again, this time enlisting Latin American democracies. Panamanian opponents of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been urging that approach for weeks. Military rule in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> began when Col. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> seized power in a 1968 coup.

 <PERSON> Itzik </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> version of <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON>, ca n't get used to having Arabs next-door. His Arab neighbor ca n't get used to <PERSON> Itzik </PERSON> The hotheaded pair are the central characters in `` Neighbors,'' a comedy series produced by Israeli television about a subject most people consider deadly serious: Jewish-Arab relations. The 70-minute pilot broadcast Friday night started off with <PERSON> Itzik </PERSON>, a Jewish insurance salesman, moving into a new apartment. He's happy until he notices the nameplate across the hall has a distinctly Arab ring: <PERSON> Medawar </PERSON>. A few minutes later, a middle-aged woman knocks on <PERSON> Itzik </PERSON>'s door to ask for help fixing a short circuit. <PERSON> Itzik </PERSON> asks her how she feels about `` the issue.'' `` Oh, I do n't mind having Jewish neighbors,'' replies <PERSON> Muna </PERSON> <PERSON> Medawar </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Itzik </PERSON> minds have Arabs next-door. When Mrs. <PERSON> Medawar </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON>, a garage owner, shows up in <PERSON> Itzik </PERSON>'s apartment with a tire, <PERSON> Itzik </PERSON> exclaims: `` Oh my God, a burning tire in the house!'' The Arab dubs <PERSON> Itzik </PERSON> `` Mr. Transfer.'' The references are clear. Burning tires have become a symbol of the six-month Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. And right-wing Israelis want to transfer all Arabs out of the occupied lands. <PERSON> Itzik </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Dorit </PERSON>, is more tolerant. Within minutes, she is visiting <PERSON> Muna </PERSON> for coffee and setting off a chain of neighborly interactions. `` The message is simple: we can live together,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamar </PERSON>, the Arab Israeli who directed the show. Producer <PERSON> Mika </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravid </PERSON> is Jewish, and the actors are Jews and Arabs. It was not so simple to produce a show on personal relations between Jewish and <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> citizens. `` Neighbors'' is <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>'s first entertainment show in 20 years to approach such sensitive subjects as racism, prejudice, mutual suspicion and political enmity. At least one previous attempt on <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> failed because critics feared the program's encouragement of peaceful coexistence might be interpreted as extending beyond friendly relations _ to romantic ties and interfaith marriages. `` We may just tiptoe around that bombshell,'' <PERSON> Ravid </PERSON> said. `` Neighbors,'' produced on a budget of a little more than $ 50,000, is considered the brainchild of <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Barel </PERSON>, manager of the television's Arabic Department. Nearly two years ago, he suggested a humorous show about `` the problem.'' `` We invested a tremendous amount of time and work,'' <PERSON> Ravid </PERSON> said. `` We sat down over every scene and every sensitive point so that it could touch on current issues but not offend anyone on either side.'' One technique that makes the show understandable to all is that the Israeli characters speak Hebrew, with Arabic subtitles, while the Arabs speak their own language, with Hebrew subtitles. The show is not directly about relations between Israelis and Palestinians from the occupied territories. Its message of tolerance is built around <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> citizens _ a community of 750,000 people who have lived in the state since its independence but who face discrimination despite their status as citizens. <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Zumot </PERSON>, a Palestinian from Israeli-annexed <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said he thought long and hard before accepting the lead role, because the theme did not touch on the issue of occupation. But the burly man, who portrays a character constantly battling his waistline as well as his wife's diet food is a key factor in making the program work. His range of facial expressions is one reason viewers can laugh at the painful topic that few Israelis and even fewer Palestinians feel free to joke about. When <PERSON> Muna </PERSON> warns him that the rich fried foods he loves will drive up his blood pressure, he says, `` That guy across the hall will give me high blood pressure.'' `` He just needs time to get used to us,'' <PERSON> Muna </PERSON> says. `` Get used to us? What are we, asthma?'' <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> retorts, sneaking a plateful of cookies to eat in the bathroom. The actor hopes the series, which will be ready for next winter's television season, will be `` a step on the road to peace.'' `` I want people to think more than laugh,'' <PERSON> Zumot </PERSON> said. `` I think of the apartment building as this region of the world. The Jewish apartment is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and the Arab apartment is <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. And I want the Israelis to learn that when there will be a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, it will not be as dangerous as they think.''

 <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the ousted capital <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, took the unprecedented step of using Western news media to insist that the party's No. 2 man, <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, resign because he is blocking reform. Never before has a fallen Soviet leader so sharply and publicly criticized a high-level party official still in power. In interviews Monday with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said it was a mistake to say <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to remake Soviet society are going according to plan `` This is a dangerous thing to say,'' said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, an outspoken advocate of reform. He told the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> should resign because he is the main impediment to `` perestroika,'' the Russian word for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s restructuring. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> also said he was upset that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not rally to his defense when he was shunted aside. The interviews shed light on <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s fall from power that culminated in his removal Feb. 18 as a candidate, or non-voting, member of the ruling Politburo. They also were the most extensive he has granted the Western media since he was ousted as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party leader in November 1987. In addition, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> chose to speak out as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> seeks to boost his standing at home through his five-day summit with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> should go `` because processes in the party are too slow, because the party is still lagging behind, because the process of democratization in the party is not developing ... and <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> is the main person responsible for this.'' <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, 67, formally oversees <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ideology. In an interview published in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> last year, he said he presides over the meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secretariat </ORGANIZATION>, which runs this vast country from day-to-day. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, 57, told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> the style of <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s leadership `` contradicts the spirit of perestroika.'' `` He's one of the opponents when it comes to questions of social justice,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>. Pressed by the interviewer, he said he thought <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> should resign. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms have met stiff resistance. `` In the first period of perestroika, there was an excessive euphoria about how quickly change would come,'' he said. `` But three years have passed and there have been no basic changes. If there have n't been any changes in another three years, then people's faith in perestroika will decline.'' The stunning statements came as the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is embroiled in fierce struggles between conservatives and reform advocates in preparation for a party conference that opens June 28, the first such session since 1941. It was not known whether <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s comments were sanctioned, or even supported, by other high-ranking party members. CBS anchorman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON>, who interviewed <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` I ca n't believe he would do this ... unless he feels, right or wrong, he has a green light from above.'' However, Rather quoted <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> as saying in portions of the interview not broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> that he received no prior approval for his comments. As <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> stood out for his brusque, attacking manner and populist style. He was popular among Muscovites for criticizing consumer shortages, sometimes striding into stores to take his complaints straight to shopkeepers. This style apparently got him into trouble when he made a still-unpublished speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 21, 1987. Reports said he criticized what he saw as the slow pace of reform and attacked <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> confirmed to the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> that he criticized <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> by name at that meeting. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was replaced as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief by <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON> following a meeting during which <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> put `` personal ambitions above the interests of the party'' and also lacked self-discipline. Removed from the Politburo, he was named to the Cabinet-level position of deputy head of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He was removed from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal legislature, on May 4 Asked if he was upset <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not defend him, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>: `` I'm upset. He feels this, and I told him I'm dissatisfied with my present job. He said that when relieved of his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> post, `` I was accused of being an ultraleftist, which I'm not. I'm simply in favor of energetic action for perestroika ... which would bring results. And so far the results are very, very insignificant.''

<HEAD>Poll Finds Dissatisfaction With Presidential Nomination System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most Americans favor major changes in the selection of presidential nominees, with six in 10 saying they would eliminate political conventions and let voters choose the candidates directly, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll has found. As the primary season winds down, with the final contests June 7, the survey found broad dissatisfaction with the selection system. A majority of respondents said they did not follow the campaigns regularly and only half believed the races provide a good discussion of the issues. Sizable minorities said the best candidates generally lose their bid for the nomination, particularly on the Democratic side. Fifty-two percent of the 1,204 adults in the national poll favored major changes in the way the parties pick nominees, while only 38 percent said the system works well enough now. Ten percent did n't know. The dissatisfaction evenly spanned ideologies and political affiliations. The most striking split was in age: The youngest adults, ages 18-29, thought by a narrow margin that the system works well enough, while the oldest, those older than 64, broadly favored major changes, by 56-28 percent. The age split was mirrored in levels of attentiveness to the races. Just 27 percent of the youngest group said they had been following the primary campaigns regularly, compared with 54 percent of the oldest group. There was majority agreement on another way to select candidates. Fifty-nine percent said they would prefer to have voters select the nominees, without any delegates to party conventions. Only 31 percent favored the party convention system. Though rules vary by state, generally voters select some delegates, the party selects others and the delegates meet to choose the nominee at conventions, where under some circumstances delegates can switch their allegiance. Just 3 percent liked the idea of letting party leaders select the nominee on their own. In another measure of unhappiness with the presidential nomination process, sizable minorities of Americans said the parties generally do not nominate their best candidate from among those running. The Democrats fared worse, to the point that a plurality of the men in the poll said the Democrats do not choose their best candidate. Overall, 46 percent of respondents said the Democrats generally do pick their best candidate from those who seek the nomination, and 40 percent said not. But while women by a 51-33 margin said the Democrats do take their best candidate, men by a 47-41 split said not. More respondents overall, 52 percent, said the Republicans nominate their best candidate from among those running, while 36 percent said not. Respondents who identified themselves as Republicans or Democrats tended to favor their party's choices. But the Democratic respondents said by 51-38 that the Republicans make their best choice, while the Republicans and the independents were split on whether the Democrats make their best pick. On the selection of vice presidential candidates, less than a quarter of the respondents said the second-place finisher should be the nominee, while a large majority favored leaving the choice to the presidential candidate. Fifty-one percent said the nomination campaigns usually provide a good discussion of the issues. But 40 percent disagreed, and college graduates and higher-income Americans were split on the question. Sixty-four percent of black respondents said the campaigns provide a good discussion of the issues, possibly a reflection of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s efforts as a candidate for the Democratic nomination. Despite criticisms of the Super Tuesday Southern regional primaries as largely a superficial media event, 55 percent of Southerners agreed that the campaigns provided a good discussion of the issues. A plurality of respondents overall and a majority of Southerners said Super Tuesday was a good idea, and 54 percent of all respondents said regional primaries should be held again. On attentiveness to the races, 41 percent said they have been following this year's primaries regularly, 50 percent said they paid occasional attention, and 9 percent followed the campaigns hardly at all or not at all. The Media General-Associated Press poll consisted of telephone interviews April 29-May 8 with a randomly selected sample of respondents. The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the Tampa -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION> -RRB-.

<HEAD>Four Shopkeepers Sentenced to Death for Arson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four shopkeepers have been sentenced to death for arson and 49 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members disciplined for helping the merchants defraud insurance companies, an official report said today. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said the four merchants, in two cities of the northeastern <LOCATION> Heilongjiang </LOCATION> province, set fire to their shops after taking out large insurance policies obtained through bribes to local officials. Five people were killed in one of the fires. The newspaper said two brothers, <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Guangcai </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Guangde </PERSON>, falsified documents in <LOCATION> Qitaihe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to insure their stationery store and restaurant for $ 224,000. Two days later, they set fire to a bag filled with gasoline, starting a blaze that killed five people and caused $ 27,000 in damage, the paper said. The report said <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuli </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Yichun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> took out insurance worth $ 192,000 on a hardware store he managed after the store lost $ 72,000 over a 10-month period as a result of waste and mismanagement. And it said <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xibin </PERSON> rented a storehouse from <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> and insured it for $ 84,000, although it had only two counters and a sofa. The two set fire to the stores five times in May and June of last year, damaging six nearby stores and causing $ 24,000 in losses, the report said. The four provided local officials with high-quality cigarettes, wine, refrigerators, motorcycles and other goods to obtain contracts for the stores and the expensive insurance policies, it said. The report did not say if the death sentences had been carried out.

<HEAD>For Gorbachev and His Countrymen, War Is an Ever-Present Memory</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VOLGOGRAD, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was 19 when he saw this city, and it was in ruins. It was then called <LOCATION> Stalingrad </LOCATION>, and it had been the scene of one of the bloodiest and most savage battles of the Second World War. It left an impression that was still vivid in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s mind more than three and a half decades later. `` I went to study at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and I traveled through <LOCATION> Stalingrad </LOCATION>, which had been destroyed, through <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION>, which had been destroyed,'' he told an interviewer in 1986. `` Nothing but ruins everywhere ... the whole country was in ruins.'' World War II divided <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s family and devastated much of his home region in southern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. By the time he saw <LOCATION> Stalingrad </LOCATION>, in 1950, war for the budding law student was no vague or distant concept, but a terrible reality that had hit close to home. Today, more than four decades after the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> struggled and defeated the invading <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> armies, the war continues to haunt the collective Soviet soul, and perhaps <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself. For Soviets, the conflict they call the `` Great Patriotic War'' is simultaneously a glorious chapter in their country's history, proof of the superiority of socialism, a convenient alibi when things go wrong, and a tragedy whose scars are felt even today. The wartime alliance between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> against the Axis is also cited by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, as proof that the superpowers need not be adversaries, but can be allies. `` When the time posed the question acutely, irrevocably and that question had to be answered, the Soviet and American peoples united,'' he told a group of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> schoolchildren who visited the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> earlier this month. `` The present time ... also makes vast demands, above all on our two great peoples.'' Virtually every Soviet family, including <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s, was touched by the four years of bitter fighting that ranged throughout the western <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and claimed the lives of 20 million Soviet soldiers and civilians. After the German armies drove across the Soviet border in June 1941, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON>, a tractor driver, was called to the front, and served for four years. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> was 10 years old when the fighting broke out. His native <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION> region, 300 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Volgograd </LOCATION>, was overrun by the German 40th <ORGANIZATION> Panzer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> for seven months beginning in August 1942, just as the battle for <LOCATION> Stalingrad </LOCATION> was raging. From just one collective farm in the <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION> region, in the village of <LOCATION> Beshpagir </LOCATION>, 417 young men and women went away to fight, and were killed in battle. The grip of World War II on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> mind, and the use made of the memories by authorities, are nowhere more evident than in the city once called <LOCATION> Stalingrad </LOCATION>. In the titanic battle that raged here, as many as 1 million Soviets may have perished and 1.5 million Germans were killed, wounded or taken prisoner. In this city situated on a bend in the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> river 600 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, 90 percent of the buildings in the industrial and residential center were devastated by artillery strikes, dive bombing raids and months of dogged house-to-house fighting. President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> said the eight-month battle that ended in February 1943 with the surrender of encircled <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> units had marked `` the turning point in the war of the Allied Nations against the forces of aggression.'' At former Soviet battlefield sites like <LOCATION> Volgograd </LOCATION>, every day is Memorial Day. About 3 million Soviets visit a gigantic memorial complex here each year, many of them veterans returning to see the place where many of their comrades were killed. `` You feel a great weight in your soul,'' said <PERSON> Amazas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arutunyan </PERSON>, 63, an Armenian who served as a private in the 93rd Artillery Regiment until he was badly wounded. `` So many men fell in combat, some screaming, others just falling in silence, like leaves.'' The war medals worn by the wizened man thumped against his chest as he slowly climbed a half-mile to the top of <PERSON> Mamayev </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurgan </PERSON> hill, where a huge statue of <LOCATION> Mother </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, slightly larger than the Statue of Liberty, brandishes a sword and calls on her children to smite the invader. In a cavernous hall dominated by an enormous white stone hand holding a blazing torch, 34 dipped red banners record the names of more than 7,000 Soviet men and women who died defending <LOCATION> Stalingrad </LOCATION>. A recording of solemn music plays over and over. The effect is overpowering. `` You can not come here without tears,'' said <PERSON> Nadezhda </PERSON> <PERSON> Denisova </PERSON>, 61, a Volgograder, who was 19 when the Battle of <LOCATION> Stalingrad </LOCATION> began. Her eyes welled. `` There were so many dead.'' A visitor's book is filled with poignant messages left by those who have come to the monument. One man wrote: `` Uncle Vasiya, I have found you at last. Your name is on one of the banners.'' The memorial complex on Mamayev Kurgan hill does not only stress the heroism and patriotism of the Soviets who fought here, but also the fact that they fought in the name of socialism and Soviet power. The name of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, wartime generalissimo and Soviet dictator, was stripped from this city in 1961 when it was renamed <LOCATION> Volgograd </LOCATION>, but now the party as a whole is lauded as the organizer of World War II victory. <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobelyova </PERSON> made that point as she slowly escorted a group of 24 orphans from the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Sasovo </LOCATION> up the hill toward the giant statue of <LOCATION> Mother </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. `` Children, you must n't think that it was just our armies who won here,'' said the 41-year-old guide from <LOCATION> Volgograd </LOCATION>. `` It was our entire country, our socialist system, and our <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.''

<HEAD>Organ Donation Down, Doctors And Consent Laws Blamed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With organ donations declining and more Americans than ever awaiting transplants, specialists are begging doctors to make better use of consent laws designed to persuade families to consider donations. `` There is a large faction of the profession that has never wanted to have anything to do with this -LRB- transplant -RRB- business,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunsicker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION>, whose annual meeting begins today. `` Over and over again, we hear from a donor's family that they are glad they gave and others say they wish they had had the chance,'' he said. `` And yet the profession is not responding.'' Federal law requires hospitals to have a protocol for approaching the families of brain-dead patients about the possibility of organ donation. Forty-four states also have versions of the statute. The overall results are not impressive. Fewer kidney and heart-lung transplants were performed nationwide in 1987 than in 1986, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. And although there were a record number of heart, liver and pancreas transplants in 1987, the increase did not keep pace with previous years. Figures for 1988 are not yet available, but organ donations appear to be down by up to 10 percent, said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgeons </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharing </ORGANIZATION>. `` The problem is that they -LRB- hospitals -RRB- often have the wrong people asking in order to comply with the law,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, senior research scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> Battelle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Doctors are big offenders, experts say. `` They've got to be the hardest group in the world to educate. Once they're out of medical school, it's like they're on remote control,'' said <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>. `` You can not make a doctor do something he does n't want to do ... and there are lots of reasons why he does n't think it's appropriate to ask Mrs. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> for her husband's organs,'' <PERSON> Hunsicker </PERSON> said `` They think it takes a lot of time, that it will be a nuisance and they do n't get anything out of it.'' Some physicians tell patients' next of kin, `` ` I know you do n't want to do this, but the law says I have to ask you if you want to be a donor,''' Ms. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said Others approach distraught families too quickly. About 20 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Donor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s calls about potential donors, for instance, come from emergency rooms. `` That's awfully early to make a decision about a person being brain-dead,'' a condition in which the brain no longer functions but the body is sustained by machine, said <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, executive director of the San Francisco-based network. Part of the problem, in general, is that `` dying and death are taboo subjects'' among health-care professionals, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiernan </PERSON>, administrator of the organ recovery program for The <LOCATION> Presbyterian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` It seems to me we might do a better job of requesting donations if these requests are made within the context of an effective bereavement program,'' he said. In addition to poorly implemented consent laws, experts say, the supply of healthy organs has been reduced as recent safety measures _ including seat belt and motorcycle helmet laws _ have cut down on the number of premature deaths. The pool of potential organ donors also has been reduced in places by the growing number of people testing positive for the AIDS virus. Only about 4,000 of the estimated 22,000 to 25,000 potential organ donors actually become donors each year, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. A record 14,720 people, meanwhile, are awaiting transplants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>, technical services director for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharing </ORGANIZATION>. `` It may well be that we will never meet the need,'' <PERSON> Kiernan </PERSON> said, `` no matter what we do.''

<HEAD>Sources: Soviet Official Warned Reagan Party About Refusenik Visit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agonized over whether to visit a Jewish refusenik family after a top <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official warned that it would ruin the family's chances to emigrate, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources say. In the end, the visit never came off. And a 12-year-old girl who calls herself `` a lifelong refusenik'' was disappointed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources speaking on condition of anonymity said Monday that Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alexandr </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON> warned <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> during a summit planning meeting last week that the <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON> family would never be permitted to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visited. `` It went back and forth several times'' as the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides considered the dilemma, one source said. `` They did n't want to knuckle under to intimidation, but they did n't want to hurt the Ziemans, either.'' Instead of making the visit, the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> toured the Arbat mall in downtown <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The Ziemans waited patiently until it was clear the president would not be coming. The Ziemans' 12-year-old daughter <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> had appealed to the Reagans for help in getting her and her family out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Americans who meet her unfailingly note <PERSON> Vera </PERSON>'s uncanny resemblance to Little Orphan <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> with her curly hair and cherub cheeks. She speaks English with a British accent, as taught by her mother. She calls herself a `` lifelong refusenik'' because the family has been refused permission to emigrate virtually since her birth. `` My name is <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON>,'' she wrote the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> last month, `` but everybody calls me ` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Orphan <PERSON> Annie </PERSON>.''' `` My elder sister, who lives in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> now, tries desperately to help us get permission to leave the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> wrote the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>. `` I wish and wish I could do something too. So I made up my mind to venture to ask you for help.'' She told of her family's efforts to emigrate and of the hardships her parents have suffered since becoming refuseniks. Her father, who has worked as a plumber since losing his scientific post, recently suffered a mysterious brain ailment that has affected his vision and balance. During his hospitalization for that condition, he contracted hepatitis and has been confined to bed, although he got up to attend the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reception on Monday. <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>, a career diplomat who has dealt with the Soviets throughout much of his professional career, refused to respond to queries about the incident. But other sources who participated in planning the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' visit said the blunt warning came from <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>'s principal contacts in the Soviet government. Several sources confirmed all or part of this account on condition they not be identified by name. A White House spokesman, <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would not comment on the report, and <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> responded only indirectly, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> were free to meet with whom they please. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vera </PERSON>'s father, was asked at a reception <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave for Soviet dissidents and refuseniks Monday whether he thought a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visit would have made it more difficult for them to emigrate, a goal they have sought since 1977. `` How do we know?'' he told reporters. `` That's a very Soviet-like statement, like ` Do n't try to emigrate; do n't believe in God.' A White House advance party made a discreet visit to the Ziemans' home in a shabby apartment building in southwest <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to let them know the Reagans might come to see them. They made no commitment. It was not clear how the Soviets learned of the plan, although the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> keeps close watch on American diplomats, Soviet dissidents and refuseniks, Soviet Jews who have been refused permission to leave the country. <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON>, a former computer scientist who lost his job when he applied for an exit visa 11 years ago, has been told he is not allowed to leave for security reasons, although he contends he never had access to state secrets and has no information that could threaten Soviet security.

<HEAD>Origins of Summitry Recounted in Last Volume of Epic Churchill
Biography</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In 1953, they scoffed when Sir <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> proposed a summit conference between East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Today, as Britons buy the final volume of his biography, they're not scoffing. The last volume of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s `` Winston S. Churchill,'' which goes on sale today, illustrates the foresight that often placed the British statesman so far ahead of events that he invited ridicule. The work recounts how <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> tried to bring about a summit meeting similar to the one this week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s wartime prime minister even coined the term `` summit.'' Yet he was rebuffed by his own Cabinet and President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> _ who also foresaw the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> threat, the end of British global pre-eminence and the atomic bomb _ wrote to <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> in 1953 pleading for a summit with the Soviet leadership that took over after <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> died. But it was the height of the Cold War, and <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> replied that a summit would serve only the Soviet `` propaganda mill.'' In a speech to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> envisioned a summit, held in a secluded setting, in which `` there might be a general feeling among those gathered together that they might do something better than tear the human race, including themselves, to bits.'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Eden </PERSON>, <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>'s foreign secretary, viewed the summit offer as a signal of weakness to the Soviets and wrote in his diary: `` It must be long in history since any one speech did so much damage to its own side.'' <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> also asked <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> to approve a message to <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Molotov </PERSON>, the Soviet foreign minister, offering to go to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for informal talks. The president rejected the idea, expressing `` a bit of astonishment'' and the `` suspicion that anything the Kremlin could misinterpret as weakness or over-eagerness on our part would militate against success in negotiation.'' <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> left office in 1955 and died 10 years later, aged 91, having failed to bring about a summit. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said in an intervew: `` Churchill had a belief which is now, if you like, fulfilled in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> ... a belief that if only the leaders could sit down together, progress could be made. `` This was belittled by all the politicians as absurd and fanciful, and yet <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are sitting down, new agreements have been signed, a whole new atmosphere has been created, and <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> set it all out in 1953, 1954 and 1955 to <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>.'' Critics have acclaimed `` Never Despair,'' the final volume, and compared the biography to `` The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire.'' It fills eight volumes and 8,664 pages and took 25 years to write. Still to come are 13 companion volumes of documents. With the companion volumes, `` Winston S. Churchill'' was in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's longest biography even before the final 1,359-page installment was published in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Houghton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mifflin </LOCATION> soon will issue it in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, 51, is an <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> historian. He began as an assistant to <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON>, who wrote the first two volumes, and took over when <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> died in 1967. Shining through the final volume covering <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>'s last 20 years are his qualities of doggedness, eloquence, sense of history and unflagging gallantry to his monarch, colleagues and even political foes. He was a prodigious author but never one to `` kiss and tell.'' He sent the manuscript of his wartime memoirs to <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> asking if there was anything <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> did not want mentioned. The final lines of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s book, quoting a letter to <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> from his daughter <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Soames </PERSON>, are a fitting commentary on his leadership in the dark years of World War II: `` In addition to all the feelings a daughter has for a loving, generous father, I owe you what every Englishman, woman and child does _ Liberty itself.''

 You fly in on the state airline, <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>, make your way through <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> passport and customs control and catch a ride downtown with a driver from the state travel monopoly, Intourist. GUM, the huge state-owned department store, is packed _ but not because there's a sale on. There are no sales, the prices are fixed by ... that's right, the state. That's life in the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION>. This is, after all, a communist state. But less so, it seems, every day that perestroika survives. If the buzzword of the 1980s in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has been entrepreneurship, the key word here is cooperatives. Under the banner of perestroika, the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> campaign to restructure the nation's stagnant economy, authorities last week acted on new laws that will encourage the expansion of cooperatives, economic units akin in many ways to the small business sector of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, except that all employees are co-owners and thus share in the profits. Profits? Profits have come to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and thus profit motive. Soviet Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said last week that 14,000 cooperatives were formed in the first 18 months they were permitted, with another 6,000 formed in the past three months. The cooperative system, he said optimistically, `` in a short time can solve the most severe problems of perestroika, the demand of the population for goods and services.'' Perestroika signals a dramatic evolution in the communist economy that has built a huge military might and an ominous bureaucracy, but little in the way of consumer services that people in the West have come to take for granted. Foreigners who live here send out to <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> for the finer things in life. When the train from <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> arrives at <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> here, it is loaded down with the fruits of the capitalist West, such as dishwashing detergent, modern ranges, fresh produce and Big Macs. Soviet citizens have neither the income, nor the hard currency nor the authority to order out. Instead, they shop in state-owned shops where variety is rare and the stock is either overpriced or depleted. As a rule, quality is nothing to brag about either. Perestroika is already in deep trouble, not the least because economic restructuring has brought the uncertainties of layoffs and future price increases, without any of the rewards of a true consumer economy. Change has been a long time coming to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The local press has come to dismiss the Brezhnev-to-Chernenko era, 1964-1985, as the `` period of stagnation.'' That said, the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News _ a state-controlled paper that takes advantage of glasnost -LRB- the democratic companion of perestroika -RRB- to push the economic reforms on the front page _ has run reams about cooperatives. It's the hot topic in town, at least among the intellectuals and the foreign community. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, you ask a cabbie to take you to <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>'s maybe. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, you ask for a cooperative and if you're lucky, you make your way to one of the new restaurants _ owned by its employees, who pocket the profit and thus have an incentive to create an attractive dinner or sew an attractive dress For the past six months, the way to the <LOCATION> Vavilova </LOCATION> market has become lined with wooden stalls and card tables, as vendors sell whatever they can make or get their hands on. One young lady is modeling a red-and-white striped apron and has a dozen on the table starting at 30 rubles -LRB- about $ 50 -RRB-. A fellow across the way has got his hands on some stylish Western blue jeans _ for sale, he says, at 130 rubles -LRB- $ 200, a month's pay for many Muscovites -RRB-. After dinner, walk through the Arbat shopping mall _ or even <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> _ and you see artists selling their portraits of St. Basil's Cathedral or the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mausoleum </ORGANIZATION> They implore. They barter. They discount. They would be capitalists or eccentrics at the <LOCATION> Pontevecchio </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, or in <LOCATION> Ghirardelli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, but in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> they call themselves cooperatives. One new co-op restaurant in the northern section of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> displays the stickers of major credit cards familiar in the West and tries to make foreigners pay with plastic, an open violation of currency laws that forbid practically all private trade in hard currency. Prices at the restaurant double at midnight, and one unwary foursome found themselves stuck with a 98-ruble -LRB- $ 170 -RRB- bill for dinner, outrageous by Soviet standards but more and more common as co-ops learn the demand is there at practically any price in this supply-starved economy. This turn in the local economy is not without controversy or opposition, and many are the residents who recall Khrushchev-era reform efforts and expect this go-round to go-round, too. The current edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> has a piece whose front-page teaser says, `` Worker Demands A Revision of the Law on State Enterprise.'' The worker, identified as steelmaker <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Koptev </PERSON>, complained in an open letter to the Supreme Soviet that there are people putting roadblocks before the cooperative economy. Last week, the Supreme Soviet _ always your basic rubber stamp in this one-party society _ rebelled against a proposal to encourage cooperatives and insisted on a shift in the tax laws that would allow employees to keep a greater percentage of the profits. That's right, they were considering tax breaks. Tax breaks? It seems like curious business for Soviet communists.

 Soviet media are highlighting cases the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> perceives as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> human rights abuses, in an apparent bid to counterbalance President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting with dissidents and refuseniks. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> carried a critical commentary in advance of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, quoting Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> as saying such an action `` is hardly aimed at improving understanding between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda told its readers that although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a land of scientific and technological marvels, it is also a land of homelessness, hunger and repression of minorities. On a day when news of the summit meeting dominated the pages of the newspaper, it printed a photograph of blacks in shabby clothes lining up for a free Thanksgiving Day meal at <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, noting it was across the street from the White House. On the bottom of the same page, it printed a story about <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peltier </PERSON>, an American Indian convicted of killing two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents in 1975 at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peltier </PERSON>'s case has been cited by Soviet officials as an example of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> human rights violations. Civil rights lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> said recently that the treatment of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be raised as a human rights issue at the summit. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in one of its newscasts Monday mentioned a May 23 report by a panel of 40 prominent Americans that said minorities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were failing to make progress in efforts to achieve full participation `` in the life and prosperity of the nation.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> also publicized a news conference Monday by four Americans who came to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to speak about alleged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> human rights abuses involving minorities. The four `` wanted to make human rights part of the agenda'' at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit and provide `` a balanced view,'' said one of the participants, lawyer <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> commentary said the Soviet government is `` seriously concerned'' about the human rights situation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, especially `` discrimination against national minorities, persecution of people because of their political views and the passing of death sentences on minors.'' It also said that ideological disputes between the superpowers are inevitable, but `` one can not put up with the fact that the subject of human rights is exploited for purposes of whipping up hostility in inter-state relations, for impeding the processes of disarmament and detente.'' The Soviet Peace Committee was the setting for the news conference by the four American human rights activists, but <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said they all paid their own way to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> and Indian rights activist <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said that besides <PERSON> Peltier </PERSON>, the activists wanted to publicize the human rights cases of racial minorities, the homeless, the hungry, institutionalized disabled people, and those refugees and asylum-seekers who have been forcibly returned to the country from which they fled.

<HEAD>After Reagan Meets With Dissidents, Gorbachev Cautions Against
`Sermonizing'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At the end of a day in which President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> demonstrated his sympathy with Soviet dissidents, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> cautioned against `` sermonizing'' that could sour superpower relations. The general secretary's comments came at a state dinner, hours after the president's meeting with dissidents and Jewish refuseniks drew terse comments from other Soviet officials. <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, the Soviet foreign ministry spokesman, said those who attended the emotion-laden session with the president at the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador's home were `` not the best of the Soviet people.'' He dismissed a question about whether the dissidents could face reprisals as a result of the meeting: `` I met Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today, but I do n't think I am going to be harmed in any way by just meeting him.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in his toast at the dinner for the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> Monday night, said, `` We want to build contacts among people in all forms, to expand and improve the quality of information, and to develop ties in the spheres of science, culture, education, sports, and any other human endeavor.'' `` But this should be done without interfering in domestic affairs, without sermonizing, or imposing one's views and ways, without turning family or personal problems into a pretext for confrontation between states,'' the Soviet leader said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> expressed hope that his push for improvements in human rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would get results under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s leadership `` I've come to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with this human rights agenda because, as I suggested, it is our belief that this is a moment of hope. The new Soviet leaders appear to grasp the connection between certain freedoms and economic growth,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said at <LOCATION> Spaso </LOCATION> house during the meeting with dissidents and refuseniks. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also visited the 13th century <LOCATION> Danilov </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monastery </LOCATION> where monks practice the Russian Orthodox faith in the communist country. There, he told the monks, `` The faith of your people has been tested and tempered in the crucible of hardship. We may hope that perestroika will be accompanied by a deeper restructuring ... and that glasnost, which means giving voice, will also let loose a new chorus of belief.'' `` Our people feel it keenly when religious freedom is denied to anyone anywhere, and hope with you that soon all the many Soviet religious communities ... including the Ukrainian Catholic and Orthodox Churches, will soon be able to practice their religion freely and openly,'' he said. At the meeting of prominent dissidents, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sat next to <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stollar </PERSON>, the 73-year-old American who came to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a child in the 1930s and has battled since 1975 to get himself and his family out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Those at his table included <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Timofeyev </PERSON>, an activist released from prison last February; <PERSON> Tatyana </PERSON> <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON>, a Jewish refusenik; the Rev. Modris Plate, a Lutheran minister from <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Pytras </PERSON> <PERSON> Pakenas </PERSON>, a Lithuanian who is married to an American but can not leave the country. Both <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON>, the deputy foreign minister, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was free to do what he wanted in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> implied <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had breached protocol by seeing the 100 or so Soviets who are at odds with their country's policies. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could have seen anyone at the U.S.-Soviet summit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December, but `` took into account all nuances'' so the summit would be a success, <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said in remarks quoted by the news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> action of this kind is hardly aimed at improving understanding between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> six months ago, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reacted heatedly when he was pressed by newspaper editors on his stand on human rights. Soviet officials have long told Americans to mind their own business on the issue. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, signed autographs during the session at which a few children roamed around the large dining room. `` We are not so used to hearing such human words without any political statement,'' said <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON>, a former computer scientist who lost his job when he applied for an exit visa 11 years ago. <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON> said there was no telling whether the session with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would expedite emigration. `` How do we know?''

 J.W. <PERSON> Canty </PERSON>, an American Episcopal priest working against alcoholism and drug abuse in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, could not get <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> interested in his `` Just Say Nyet'' campaign, so he'll try her husband. <PERSON> Canty </PERSON>, 41, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet-U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcoholism </ORGANIZATION> and Drug Addiction, wants to deliver a letter to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> asking them to issue a joint statement on the need to fight addictions. `` Alcoholism and drug addiction is an extremely serious problem in both of our countries,'' <PERSON> Canty </PERSON>'s letter says. `` May history remember these days as a summit for sobriety.'' One question <PERSON> Canty </PERSON> thinks <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should address is why the cultures in the two countries seem to spawn alcoholism, a disease which robs both societies of their human resources. `` Why do these two countries share these drinking problems?'' <PERSON> Canty </PERSON> asked. In both countries, <PERSON> Canty </PERSON> thinks there is a certain `` macho'' image associated with drinking. <PERSON> Canty </PERSON> has spent two years working on and off in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> setting up the conference. Since 1986, <PERSON> Canty </PERSON> has established an Alcoholics Anonymous chapter in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, persuaded the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> city government to give him a building for a fellowship house, taken Soviet physicians on a tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to study alcoholism and arranged for Americans to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> turned down <PERSON> Canty </PERSON>'s invitation to have Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visit the site of his soon-to-be-opened fellowship house. Since 1981, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has campaigned against drugs, adopting the slogan `` Just Say No.'' The fellowship house in downtown <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will be a place for people to meet, read in the library and see videos. `` It will be a club to celebrate sobriety.'' he said. Undeterred by the reaction of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s staff, <PERSON> Canty </PERSON> decided to solicit help from the superpower leaders in writing. <PERSON> Canty </PERSON> has already eaten dinner with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and received help from the Soviet leaders' aides who are committed to the country's anti-drinking policy Since he took office, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has raised the drinking age from 18 to 21, reduced the number of liquor stores and cut back on the production of alcohol. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has challenged his people to do something but the follow-through has been a joke,'' <PERSON> Canty </PERSON> said. The Soviets say there are officially 4.3 million alcoholics in the country of about 284 million, but <PERSON> Canty </PERSON> thinks the figure is closer to about 10 million _ the same as in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda reported on Nov. 15, 1987 that there are more than 4.5 million registered alcoholics in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and that about 1 million of them need compulsory care. There has been no official estimate of the number of unregistered alcoholics. Though a drug problem exists in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, it is far less severe than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Canty </PERSON> said. Drugs like cocaine and crack are not prevalent here, but <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> women often abuse tranquilizers and teen-agers sniff Benzene, he said. <PERSON> Canty </PERSON> acknowledges that people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> find his efforts to reach global peace through sobriety somewhat off-beat. But he says he has been effective. `` I ` ve been told we are the first non-profit joint venture,'' he said. The low-budget conference is funded with money from foundations and gifts. The Soviet government has provided in-kind help such as donating a building and paying for its doctors to travel abroad. <PERSON> Canty </PERSON> receives no money from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and declines to take a salary. Since 1986, <PERSON> Canty </PERSON> has made seven trips to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and he has been here since January, staying at the National Hotel, a plush historic building overlooking the Kremlin. He operates out of his hotel room. The Russians seem perplexed by his `` grassroots, Scotch-tape operation,'' he said. `` The new party line is profit, and here we are saying, ` Do this for free,''' he said.

 Dutch police on Tuesday recovered three paintings, including works by <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON>, less than two weeks after they were stolen from this city's Municipal Museum, police said. Three Dutchmen were arrested when they tried to sell the 19th-century paintings in an <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> hotel, said police spokesman <PERSON> Klaas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilting </PERSON>. The works, whose combined worth has been estimated at up to $ 52 million, were recovered undamaged, he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The art theft was the nation's biggest ever. Wilting refused to disclose any further details of the hotel transaction. He would also not say whether the three suspects were thought to include the burglars who smashed a museum window and stole the three works on May 20. Stolen were `` Carnations,'' a 1888 work by the Dutch painter <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>, `` Bottle with Apples,'' a still life painted in 1894 by the French master <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON>; and `` The House of <PERSON> Maitre </PERSON> <PERSON> Billaud </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Nevers </LOCATION>,'' an 1874 painting by Dutch artist <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jongkind </PERSON>. Museum director <PERSON> Wim </PERSON> <PERSON> Beeren </PERSON> said at the time that the theft was thought to have been commissioned by a private art lover, since the paintings are virtually unsellable on the open market. <PERSON> Beeren </PERSON> said the record loss figure was in part due to the astronomical prices fetched recently by <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> paintings at auctions. Last November, an unidentified collector paid $ 53 million for <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Irises'' at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> auction. Eight months earlier, the impressionist master's `` Sunflowers'' was auctioned in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for $ 29.8 million. However, experts of the <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auction firm in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said soon after the <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> burglary that the three paintings were worth only $ 11 million. The theft also sparked a public debate on the security of the Dutch artistic collections. Critics said too little was being done to protect the nation's art treasures from often highly professional thieves. The pre-dawn burglary on May 20 triggered only an electronic alarm at the museum, which has 3,200 artworks, mostly modern, but no night guard. It took 20 minutes for police to arrive on the scene of the burglary reportedly because the museum's private security company failed to immediately alert authorities.

 Here is a transcript of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks Monday to the Soviet dissidents and refuseniks who met with him at <LOCATION> Spaso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Thank you all and welcome to <LOCATION> Spaso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>. After the discussions we've just had, I thought it might be appropriate for me to begin by letting you know why I so wanted this meeting to take place. You see, I wanted to convey to you that you have the prayers and support of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, indeed, of people throughout the world. I wanted to convey this support to you that, you might in turn, convey it to others so that all those working for human rights throughout this vast land, from the Urals to <LOCATION> Kamchatka </LOCATION>, from the <LOCATION> Laptev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION>, might be encouraged and take heart. Thank you. In one capacity, of course, I speak as a head of government. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> views human rights as fundamental, absolutely fundamental to our relationship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and all nations. From the outset of our administration, we've stressed that an essential element in improving relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is human rights and Soviet compliance with international covenants on human rights There have been hopeful signs, indeed, I believe this a hopeful time for your nation. Over the past three years, more than 300 political and religious prisoners have been released from labor camps, fewer dissidents and believers have been put in prisons and mental hospitals. And in recent months, more people have been permitted to emigrate or reunite with their families. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> applauds these changes, yet the basic standards the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed to almost 13 years ago in the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Accords, or a generation ago in the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Declaration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, still need to be met. If I may, I'd like to share with you the main aims of our human rights' agenda during this summit meeting here in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Freedom of religion. In the words of the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Declaration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. I'm hopeful the Soviet government will permit all the peoples of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to worship their creator as they, themselves, see fit in liberty. Freedom of speech. Again in the words of the Universal Declaration of Human rights, everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression. It is my fervent hope for you and your country that there will soon come a day when no one need fear prison for offenses that involve nothing more than the spoken or written word. Freedom of travel. I've told the General Secretary how heartened we are that during the past year the number of those permitted to emigrate has risen. We're encouraged, as well, that the number of those permitted to leave for short trips, often family visits, has gone up. And yet, the words of the Universal Declaration go beyond these steps. Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his own country. It is our hope that soon there will be complete freedom of travel. In my particular _ in particular I've noted in my talks here the many who have been denied the right to emigrate on the grounds that they held secret knowledge, even though their secret work had ended years before, and their so-called `` secrets'' had long since become either public knowledge or obsolete. Such cases must be rationally reviewed. And finally, institutional changes to make progress permanent. I've come to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with this human rights agenda because, as I suggested, it is our belief that this is a moment of hope. The new Soviet leaders appear to grasp the connection between certain freedoms and economic growth. The freedom to keep the fruits of one's own labor, for example, is a freedom that the present reforms seem to be enlarging. We hope that one freedom will lead to another and another; that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government will understand that it is the individual who is always the source of economic creativity, the inquiring mind that produces a technical breakthrough, the imagination that conceives of new products and markets, and that in order for the individual to create we must have a sense _ he must have a sense of just that _ his own individuality, his own self worth. He must sense that others respect it; and yes, that his nation respects him, respects him enough to grant him all his human rights. This _ ths, as I said, is our hope, that whatever the future may bring, the commitment of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will nevertheless remain unshakeable on human rights, on the fundamental dignity of the human person. There can be no relenting, for now we must work for more, always more. And here, I would like to speak to you, not as a head of government, but as a man, a fellow human being. I came here hoping to do what I could to give you strength, yet I already know it is you who have strengthened me, you who have given me a message to carry back. While we press for human rights through diplomatic channels, you press with your very lives, day in and day out, year after year, risking your jobs, your homes, your all. If I may, I want to give you one thought from my heart. Coming here and being with you and looking into your faces, I have to believe that the history of this troubled century will indeed be redeemed in the eyes of God and man, and that freedom will truly come to all, for what injustice can withstand your strength, and what can conquer your prayers? And so, I say with <PERSON> Pushkin </PERSON>, `` it's time my friend, it's time. The heart begs for peace, the days fly past, it's time, it's time.'' Could I play a little trick on you and say something that is n't written here Sometimes, when I'm faced with an unbeliever, an atheist, I am tempted to invite him to the greatest gourmet dinner that one could ever serve. And when we've finished eating that magnificent dinner, to ask him if he believes there's a cook. Thank you all and God bless you. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I have to leave you. We're going to have a little talk with the General Secretary.

 Here is a transcript of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech Monday at the <LOCATION> Danilov </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monastery </LOCATION>: __ It's a very great pleasure to visit this beautiful monastery and to have a chance to meet some of the people who have helped make its return to the Russian Orthodox Church a reality. I am also addressing in spirit the 35 million believers whose personal contributions made this magnificent restoration possible. It's been said that an icon is a window between heaven and earth through which the believing eye can peer into the beyond. One can not look at the magnificent icons created and recreated here under the direction of Father Zinon without experiencing the deep faith that lives in the hearts of the people of this land. Like the saints and martyrs depicted in these icons, the faith of your people has been tested and tempered in the crucible of hardship, but in that suffering it has grown strong, ready now to embrace with new hope the beginnings of a second Christian millennium. We in our country share this hope for a new age of religious freedom in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. We share the hope that this monastery is not an end in itself, but the symbol of a new policy of religious tolerance that will extend to all peoples of all faith. We pray that the return of this monastery signals a willingness to return to believers the thousands of other houses of worship which are now closed, boarded up, or used for secular purposes. There are many ties of faith that bind your country and mine. We have in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> many churches, many creeds that feel a special kinship with their fellow believers here -- <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, Jewish, Orthodox, and Islamic -- they are united with believers in this country in many ways, especially in prayer. Our people feel it keenly when religious freedom is denied to anyone anywhere, and hope with you that soon all the many Soviet religious communities that are now prevented from registering will band all together, including the Ukrainian Catholic and Orthodox churches, will soon be able to practice their religion freely and openly and instruct their children in and outside the home in the fundamentals of their faith. We do n't know if this first thaw will be followed by a resurgent spring of religious liberty, we do n't know, but we may hope We may hope that perestroika will be accompanied by a deeper restructuring, a deeper conversion, a `` metenota'' -- `` metenoya,'' I should say -- a change in heart and that glasnost, which means giving voice, will also let loose a new chorus of belief, singing praise to the God that gave us life. There's a beautiful passage that I'd just like to read if I may. It's from one of this country's great writers and believers, <PERSON> Aleksandr </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>, about the faith that is as elemental to this land as the dark and fertile soil. He wrote, `` When you travel the byroads of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, you begin to understand the secrets of the pacifying <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> countryside. It is in the churches. They lift their belltowers, graceful, shapely, all different, high over mundane timber and thatch, from villages that are cutoff and invisible to each other, they soar to the same heaven. People were always selfish and often unkind, but the evening chimes used to ring out, floating over the villages, fields and woods, reminding them that they must abandon trivial concerns of this world and give time and thought to eternity.'' In our prayers, we may keep that image in mind. The thought that the bells may ring again, sounding throughout <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and across the countryside, clamoring for joy in their newfound freedom. Well I've talked long enough I'm sure you have many questions and many things on your mind and I'm anxious to hear what you have to say.

 Here is a transcript of General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s toast at the state dinner Monday night for President and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Esteemed Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, esteemed Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, ladies and gentlemen, comrades, I welcome you in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Kremlin. For five centuries it has been the site of events that constituted milestones in the life of our state. Decisions crucial to the fate of our nation were made here. The very environment around us a call for responsibility to our times and contemporaries, to the present and to the future. It is here that we wish to emphasize the importance of the newly discovered truth that it is no longer possible to settle international disputes by force of arms. Our awareness of the realities of the present day world has led us to that conclusion. I like the notion of realism, and I also like the fact that you, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, have lately been uttering it more and more often. Normal, and indeed durable, Soviet-American relations, which so powerfully affect the world's political climate, are only conceivable within the framework of realism. Thanks to realism, for all our differences we have succeeded in arriving at a joint conclusion which, though very simple, is of historic importance: a nuclear war can not be won and must never be fought. Other conclusions followed with inexorable logic. One of them is whether there is any need for weapons which can not be used without destroying ourselves and indeed all of mankind. I believe the realization of this became <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>'s pivotal idea. Our <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> allies firmly adhere to this position: this is our powerful support in all matters related to nuclear disarmament. They have given the Soviet leadership a clear mandate to negotiate radical nuclear arms limitations and reductions with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. My talks with leaders of Socialist countries, and with authoritative representatives of other nations, make it clear to me that there is a common desire to overcome military confrontation and to end the race in both nuclear and conventional arms. To this it should be added that a realistic approach is making a way for itself in all directions and on all continents. And the idea of resolving today's problems solely by political means is gaining increasing authority. There is an ever-broadening desire of the most diverse political and social forces for dialogue, for exchanges, for a better knowledge of each other, and for mutual understanding. If this is indeed so, if this is the will of the peoples, an effort is needed to ensure that the stocks of the ferment of realistic policies keep growing and never run out. For that it is essential to understand each other better; to take into account the specific features of life in various countries, the historical conditions that shape them and the choice made by their peoples. I recall the words you once spoke, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, and I quote, `` the only way to resolve differences is to understand them,'' unquote. How very true. Let me just add that seeking to resolve differences should not mean an end to being different. The diversity of the world is a powerful wellspring of mutual enrichment, both spiritual and material. Ladies and gentlemen, comrades, the word `` perestroika'' does not sound anachronistic even within these ancient walls, for renewal of society, humanization of life, and elevated ideals are at all times and everywhere in the interests of the people and of each individual. And when this happens, especially in a great country, it is important to understand the meaning of what it is going through. It is this desire to understand the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that we are now seeing abroad. And we regard this as a good sign, because we do want to be understood correctly. This is also important for civilized international relations. Everyone who wants to do business with us will find it useful to know how <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people see themselves. We see ourselves even more convinced that our socialist choice was correct, and we can not conceive of our country developing without socialism, based on any other fundamental values. Our program is more democracy, more glasnost, more social justice with full prosperity and high moral standards. Our goal is maximum freedom for man, for the individual, and for society. Internationally, we see ourselves as part of an integral civilization where each has the right to a social and political choice, to a worthy and equal place within the community of nations. On issues of peace and progress, we believe in the primacy of universal human values and regard the preservation of peace as the top priority. And that is why we advocate the establishment of a comprehensive system of international security as a condition for the survival of mankind. Linked with this is also our desire to revive and enhance the role of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on the basis of the original goals which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, together with their allies, enshrined in the charter of that organization. Its very name is symbolic _ the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> _ united in their determination to prevent new tragedies of war, to banish war from international relations, and to affirm just principles securing a worthy life for any nation, whether large or small, strong or weak, rich or poor. We want to build contacts among people in all forms, to expand and improve the quality of information, and to develop ties in the spheres of science, culture, education, sports, and any other human endeavor. But this should be done without interfering in domestic affairs, without sermonizing, or imposing one's views and ways, without turning family or personal problems into a pretext for confrontation between states. In short, our time offers great scope for action in the humanitarian field. Nations should understand each other better, know the truth about each other, and free themselves from bias and prejudice.

 As far as we know, most Americans, just like us, want to get rid of the demon of nuclear war. But they, just like us, just like all people on earth, are becoming increasingly concerned over the risk of environmental disaster. Such a risk can only be averted if we act together. Increasingly urgent is the truly global problem of the economic state of the world -- in the North and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, in the West and East of this planet. The economic foundation of civilization will be destroyed unless a way is found to put an end to the squandering of funds and resources for war and destruction, unless the problem of debt is settled and world finances are stabilized, unless the world market becomes truly worldwide by incorporating all states and nations on an equal footing. It is across this spectrum of issues that we approach international affairs and, of course, our relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We are motivated by an awareness of the realities and imperatives of the nuclear and space age _ the age of sweeping technological revolution, when the human race had turned out to be both omnipotent and mortal. It was this awareness that engendered the new thinking which has made possible a conceptual and practical breakthrough in relations between us as well. Mr. President, this meeting, while taking stock of a fundamentally important period in Soviet-American relations, has to consolidate our achievements and give new impetus for the future. Never before have nuclear missile been destroyed. Now we have an unprecedented treaty, and our two countries will be performing for the first time ever this overture of nuclear disarmament. The performance had to be flawless. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are acting as guarantors of the Afghan political settlement. This too, is a precedent of tremendous importance. As guarantors, our two countries face a very responsible period, and we hope they both will go through it in a befitting manner. The whole world is watching to see how we are going to act in this situation. Our main task continues to be the working out of an agreement on 50-percent reductions in strategic offensive arms while observing the ABM Treaty. In our talks today, you and I devoted a lot of attention and with good cause to discussing the entire range of these problems. Mr. President, we are expected to ensure that the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit open up new horizons in Soviet-American dialogue, in relations between the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> US </LOCATION>, for the benefit of our two nations and the entire world. This is worth any effort and any amount of good will. To cooperation between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to their better mutual knowledge and mutual understanding. I wish good health and happiness to you, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, to Mrs. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and to all our distinguished guests.

<HEAD>Reagans Dine in Kremlin Splendor, Tour Gorbachevs' Guest Rooms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Reagans dined on champagne and caviar in the citadel of communism. The <PERSON> Gorbachevs </PERSON> set aside their campaign against drinking to serve the best of Russian wines. The evening sun poured through floor-to-ceiling windows. All glittered when the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> played host to the visiting American president and his wife in the icon-lavished splendor of the Kremlin's Hall of Facets, then led them on a tour toured the fortress's private rooms where they could have stayed as guests if they had wished. The <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION>' state dinner Monday night under the vaulted, frescoed ceilings of the opulent chamber drew the entire <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy and a select group of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> intellectuals, scientists, a cosmonaut and Russian Orthodox clergy. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lifted their crystal glasses of Georgian wine to toast their success in narrowing the gap between the superpowers and to wish for future triumphs in learning to deal with and respect each other. The elegant dining hall was awash in light, from the windows letting in the late spring evening sunshine and the fully illuminated chandeliers that adorn the hall. Silver candlesticks raising tall white tapers and sprays of pink roses decorated tables spread with salmon pink linen. The Kremlin pomp was more subtle than December's <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> state dinner for the visiting Gorbachevs, where the women wore formal-length gowns and the American men sported black-tie attire. At that occasion, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his advisers showed up in business suits, causing eyebrows to lift in social circles. On the occasion of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' visit, the hosts set aside their anti-alcohol inclinations to treat their guests to domestic wines, champagne and cognac from the southern republics of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, to go with a dinner that began with caviar, <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> fillets and puff pastry and progressed through soups and courses of veal and perch. The president gave <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a video cassette of an American film, `` Friendly Persuasion,'' regaling the mostly Soviet gathering with a lengthy description of the Civil War story but promising not to `` spoil its outcome.'' Fourteen Americans were invited to the state dinner, including Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s senior advisers. Among the Soviet guests were all members of the ruling Politburo except <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON>, who is based in the Ukrainian capital of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>. The guests included space scientist <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON>, filmmaker <PERSON> Elem </PERSON> <PERSON> Klimov </PERSON>, former cosmonaut <PERSON> Valentina </PERSON> <PERSON> Tereshkova </PERSON> and a host of party officials. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in a sequined blouse and black skirt, listened attentively at <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s side while her husband told his guests their two nations had made history with the accord ridding the world of an entire class of weapons. `` Now we have an unprecedented treaty. And our countries will have to perform for the first time an overture of nuclear disarmament,'' the Soviet leader said. `` The performance should be faultless.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also pointed to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet role as guarantors of the Afghan accords signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on April 14, noting their cooperation is of `` immense significance'' for their future. `` The entire world is watching how we both will act in this situation,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. In his response, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> focused on the accomplishments he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have been able to achieve in their four meetings since 1985. `` These are good first steps, Mr. General Secretary, and we can both take pride in them,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, as the first lady, in a red print dress and heavy gold necklace, listened from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s rose-strewn table The Reagans stayed at the Kremlin for more than an hour after the dinner for a tour by their hosts of the Grand Kremlin Palace's private rooms, where former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> stayed during his 1972 and 1974 summits here `` They were quite lovely and the entire palace was really quite magnificent,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, according to her press secretary, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrialist <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, whose ties with the Soviets reach back to the days of Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s leadership, described the state dinner as `` a very warm and happy occasion.

<HEAD>Brubeck to Test the Jazz Waters with the Gorbachevs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> used to say jazz gave him gas, but no one seems to know what effect it has on <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Tonight, pianist <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON> plans to find out when he gives the general secretary and his wife <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> a taste of `` Take Five'' and other American jazz classics. One thing is for sure, says <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON>: the Reagans like jazz. They have chosen him to perform with his quintet at a state dinner for the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence where the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> are staying during the summit. `` The Reagans really seem to appreciate American music in general. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> seems to know all the standards. You can see her mouthing the words,'' the gray-haired 67-year-old <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON> said in an interview Monday. As for the president, a former <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> actor, <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON> recalled that at a Feb. 21 performance at the White House for governors, `` He told me how much he loved the big bands and how much they were a part of American history.'' <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON> is no stranger to the halls of power. He was the first jazz musician to play at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and has entertained every president since <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. He met the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> but did n't have a chance to talk to them or play for them at the previous summit state dinner at the White House last December. That dinner produced one of the most memorable moments of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit _ the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> singing along as the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> classical pianist <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> played the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> standard `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Nights.'' Asked if he would follow in <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON>'s footsteps with the dixieland jazz version of the song, renamed `` Midnight in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON> said: `` We're prepared to play it if someone asks, but it's been done so many times. But in typical Brubeckian manner, if it's played, it'll be with a twist, in five-four rhythm. `` It can be done,'' he assured a doubting reporter. In honor of the occasion, <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON> has dug up `` The Real Ambassadors,'' a song he wrote in 1958 for a musical that featured trumpeter <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> running the world for a day. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> wo n't hear it because <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON> plans to play only an instrumental version of the song, one line speaks of Armstrong using music to bring peace: `` The next time around, it's a session where we jam the blues <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> pounding both his shoes could n't have the final say if I was king for a day.'' <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, who pounded a shoe on a desk at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in 1960, was no jazz lover. `` When I hear jazz, it's as if I had gas on the stomach,'' he said in December 1963. At the other extreme, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief who led the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from November 1982 until his death in February 1984, was reputed to be a jazz fan. But although Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has showed up at several classical music concerts, little is known about the Kremlin couple's musical tastes. `` I keep asking everyone if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> likes jazz, but no one seems to know,'' says <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON>'s 36-year-old son <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, who plays bass guitar and trombone in the group. `` They all say <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON> liked jazz and had a huge record collection.'' The elder <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON>, who says he's played in most countries of the world, from `` the dance halls to all the joints'' during his 50-year career, believes jazz is a unique medium for espousing the American ideal of freedom. `` To play jazz, you have to have tremendous discipline and you are expected to use it in a free way. There's no art form that represents <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> better than jazz,'' he said. And to many jazz lovers, there is no single jazz standard better known than `` Take Five,'' <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON>'s 1958 tune that was the first jazz single to go gold. The <LOCATION> Wilton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, resident gave Soviets who had heard him only on <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> shortwave broadcasts and records a chance to hear him in person in March and April of last year. He played 13 concerts in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. The Soviet record label Melodiya plans to release a recording from last year's tour. It has already come out in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, under the title `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Night.''

<HEAD>In a Land Officially Atheistic, Religious Faith Arises Anew</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Religious faith in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is reviving slowly in a land where state-imposed atheism has long held sway. But it is a slow emergence, and the church hierarchy is cautious. As evidence that the atmosphere is changing, church, state and party officials cite the return to the church of the 13th century <PERSON> Danilov </PERSON> <PERSON> Monastery </PERSON>, the promise of a new law relaxing Stalin-era restrictions on worship and the release from prison and labor camps of religious dissidents. The dissidents cautiously agree. Still they have asked President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to join them in prayer Wednesday for an estimated 200 people they say still are prisoners because of the beliefs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s oldest monastery Monday, paid tribute to the Orthodox faith that next week will mark its 1,000 th anniversary `` Religious life still is strictly regulated by the Stalinist legislation on cults, which deprives us of the possibility of uniting in religious community without barriers, to own houses of worship, study and distribute the Bible, and teach our children in Sunday school,'' seven religious dissidents said in a statement to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` We ask you to give us the great honor of your presence at a joint prayer for the freeing of prisoners of faith,'' they said. Dissidents, led by former political prisoners Father <PERSON> Gleb </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON> and layman <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON> and others, also seek recognition for the underground Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and return to the Orthodox Church of the Pechersky monastery in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, the country's oldest. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told monks at the <PERSON> Danilov </PERSON> monastery that he hoped the church bells silenced by repression might someday be `` clamoring for joy in their newfound freedom.'' He did not say whether he could accept their invitation. He expressed the hope that Ukrainian Catholic believers and others might soon be able to openly practice their faith. Orthodoxy, for centuries the dominant faith of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, was closely identified with the czarist government and suffered severe repression after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. Tens of thousands of churches were destroyed or converted to government use, priests were exiled or killed, and in 1927 under dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> authorities passed strict laws prohibiting charitable activities, religious education of the young and requiring registration of all religious organizations with the government. Those strictures remain in force today. In a meeting with Patriarch <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and All <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> on April 29, <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> criticized the `` tragic developments'' of the <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> years and promised to ease restrictions on the church in the new legislation that is being developed. <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON> pledged `` full support to ... the architect of perestroika and the herald of new political thinking.'' The meeting between the ailing church leader and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the son of a religious farm woman, was the first of its kind since 1943. There is no official count of believers in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but the number is thought to be in the tens of millions, perhaps as many as 90 million including Jews and Moslems. Besides the Orthodox church, Soviet Christians include Eastern Rite and Roman Catholics, and Baptists, Pentacostalists and other Protestants. Some members of those groups fear that the easing of restrictions on the Orthodox church will not extend to them. The majority of churchgoers still are middle-age or older, but young people are increasingly attending services. Orthodox priests say they receive many requests to be baptized by young people who know little about the faith, but are searching for something to give meaning to their lives. In news conferences and interviews with the official press, church officials recently have for the first time cautiously criticized the existing laws and expressed confidence that the new legislation will ease the restrictions. Some prominent Soviets, such as historian <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Likhachev </PERSON>, have come to the defense of the church, publicly praising its contribution to the unification of the Russian state and the development of art and culture. <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON> earlier this year called for <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON> to step down as patriarch, saying the Orthodox church needed a more active leader to take advantage of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies. But others, such as <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>, are deeply suspicious of the entire church hierarchy and believe that any official must be thoroughly compromised to reach a prominent church position.

 Here is a transcript of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s toast at Monday night's state dinner at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. Mr. General Secretary, I want to thank you again for the hospitality that we've encountered this evening, and at every turn since our arrival in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. We appreciate deeply the personal effort that you and Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and all of your associates have expended on our behalf. Today has been a busy day. I want to thank you for the opportunity to meet with so many divergent members of Soviet society. As you know, I traveled to <PERSON> Danilov </PERSON> and met there with the clergy of that ancient monastery, and later in the day had the most interesting exchanges with other members of Soviet society as <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. These meetings only confirmed, Mr. General Secretary, the feelings of admiration and warmth that Americans harbor for the peoples of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. As wartime allies, we came to know you in a special way. But in a broader sense, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, like the rest of the world, admire the saga of the peoples of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the clearing of the forest, the struggle to build a society, the evolution into a modern state, and the struggle against <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s armies. There are other ways too, that we know you. `` Happy or sad my beloved, you are beautiful,'' says one of your folksongs, `` as beautiful as a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> song, as beautiful as a Russian soul.'' As expressed in the great music, architecture, art, we need only look about us this evening. And literature, that over many centuries, you've given the world, we have beheld the beauty and majesty of your peoples' national experience. And without belittling the serious business before us or the fundamental issues that separate our governments, I hope you'll permit me tonight, to say that in the eyes of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, your people truly are as the song _ the folksong suggests, a people of heart and mind, a people _ to use our vernacular _ with soul. And that's why we believe there is common ground between our two peoples and why it is our duty to find common ground for our two governments. Over the next three days, General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and I will review what has been accomplished over the past three years and what our two nations might accomplish together in the months to come. We have a great deal to discuss on both accounts. What we have achieved is a good beginning. We have taken the first step toward deep reductions of our nuclear arsenals. We have taken the first step toward dealing with the reality that much of the tension and mistrust between our two countries arises from the very different concepts of the fundamental rights and role of the individual in society. We have taken the first step to build that network of personal relationships and understanding between societies, between people, that are crucial to dispelling dangerous misconceptions and stereotypes. These are good first steps, Mr. General Secretary, and we can both take pride in them. But, as I said, they are just a start. Nuclear arsenals remain too large. The fighting continues needlessly, tragically, in too many regions of the globe. The vision of freedom and cooperation enshrined in the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act remains unrealized. The American and Soviet peoples are getting to know each better, but not well enough. Mr. General Secretary, you and I are meeting now for the fourth time in three years _ a good deal more often than our predecessors. And this has allowed our relationship to differ from theirs in more than a quantitative state or sense. We have established the kind of working relationship I think we both had in mind when we first met in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. We've been candid about our differences, but sincere in sharing a common objective and working hard together to draw closer to it. It's easy to disagree, and much harder to find areas where we can agree. We and our two governments have both gotten into the habit of looking for those areas. We found more than we expected. I intend to pursue the search for common ground during the months left to me as president. When I pass the job on to my successor, I intend to tell him it is a search that must be continued. Based on the achievements of the last few years, I will also tell him it is a search that can succeed.

 Democrat presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised black supporters he would give <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> a role in his expected fall campaign against <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and said he was counting on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support. `` We're going to have as united a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as we've ever had,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said after a Memorial Day breakfast with about 90 black supporters from across the country. `` I do not see any deep divisions'' with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, he said after the session. `` Neither of us wants four more years of what we've had the past eight,'' said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. The meeting was closed to the media but described by participants as a frank and cordial discussion of what <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> needs to do to win the support of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s black constituency. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> himself, campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, said he did n't want his support `` isolated by race.'' But he spoke kindly of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' overtures to the black community `` He has an obligation to reach out,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also attended a Memorial Day service and met at the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> with Argentine President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. The two met two years ago when <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and they exchanged warm greetings after the private meeting. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was to tend to state business today and attend receptions in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> tonight. He was to be back at the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday before heading to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> in the week left until the June 7 primaries in those states, which are expected to give <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a lock on the nomination. Although participants in the Monday gathering were unanimous in predicting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would support <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the fall, the session was designed partly to plot strategy for seeking black support regardless of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s role. `` He showed his compassion and his understanding of the plight of black Americans,'' former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Mayor Dutch <PERSON> Morial </PERSON> said. And he said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' affirmative action record as governor and his commitments to economic opportunity, health care and housing would appeal to black voters. `` The record is an excellent one,'' said <PERSON> Thomasina </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, a potential <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegate. Participants said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised to offer some <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign aides jobs in the fall campaign and also promised that blacks and other minorities would have major roles in a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration. `` Very clearly the presence of black Americans in this campaign is going to have to be expanded,'' said <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` We got that commitment from today from <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was not specific about what role he believed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should have. He is not expected to offer <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> the No. 2 spot on the ticket. `` What kind of role would I play if I came in second and he came in first?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked rhetorically. `` I would be out there working for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> victory.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, too, said he expected to have `` a big role at the convention and a big role this fall,'' but added: `` That role has not been determined.'' Longtime <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, who organized the meeting, said black <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters with ties to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aides would hold frequent talks with them in the month leading into the July convention.

 Once again, Mr. General Secretary, I want to extend my thanks for your hospitality. I also hope you'll permit me to mention that, as you have been a gracious host, we've tried to be gracious guests by bringing along some small expressions of our gratitude. There's one gift in particular that I wanted to mention, not only in view of my own former profession, but because it has, I think, something important to say to us about what is under way this week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> It is a film _ not as well known as some, but an American classic. It is a powerfully acted and directed story of family and romantic love, of devotion to the land, and dedication to higher principle. It is also fun. It has humor. There's a renegade goose, a mischievous young boy, a noisy neighbor, a love-struck teen-ager in love with a gallant soldier, an adolescent struggling for manhood, a loving, highly principled wife, and a gentle but strong father. It's about the good and sometimes difficult things that happen between man and wife and parent and child. The film also has sweep and majesty and power and pathos. For you see, it takes place against the backdrop of our <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> epic, the civil war. And because the family is of the Quaker religion and renounces violence, each of its characters must, in his or her own way, face this war and the moral dilemma it poses. The film shows not just the tragedy of war, but the problems of pacifism, the nobility of patriotism, as well as the love of peace. I promise not to spoil its outcome for you. But I hope you'll permit me to describe one scene. Just as the invading armies come into southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, one of our states, the Quaker farmer is approached by two of his neighbors. One is also a Quaker, who earlier in the story, when times are peaceful, denounces violence and vows never to lift his hand in anger. But now that the enemy has burned his barn, he's on his way to battle and criticizes his fellow Quaker for not joining him in renouncing his religious beliefs. The other visitor, also on his way to battle, is the intruding but friendly neighbor. Yet it is this neighbor, although a nonbeliever who says he's proud of the Quaker farmers' decision not to fight, in the face of the tragedy of war, he is grateful, as he says, that somebody's holding out for a better way of settling things. It seems to me, Mr. General Secretary, that in pursing these summit meetings, we too have been holding out for a better way of settling things. And by the way, the film's title is more than a little appropriate _ it's called `` Friendly Persuasion.'' So, Mr. General Secretary, allow me to raise a glass to the work that has been done, the work that remains to be done. And let us also toast the art of friendly persuasion, the hope of peace with freedom, the hope of holding out for a better way of settling things. Thank you, and God bless you.

<HEAD>Study: Afghanistan Unable To Support Return Of Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The war-ravaged Afghan countryside could not feed the country's millions of civil war refugees if they were to return immediately, a new study on the state of Afghan agriculture says. `` There was deliberate destruction of the agricultural system by the Russians, particularly along the highways,'' Professor <PERSON> Azam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gul </PERSON>, an Afghan citizen who directed the six-month study, told a news conference Monday. `` If the refugees returned en masse now, the land would not support them. That is the categorical conclusion of the survey,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> of the Britain-based Agrisystems, which trained the researchers and collated the data. <PERSON> Gul </PERSON> said the devastation had occurred mainly since Soviet troops intervened in 1979 to back the government in its war with anti-communist guerrillas. Villages were systematically bombed and trees destroyed around <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> bases, he said. The Soviets are in the process of withdrawing their more than 100,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> under a U.N.-sponsored accord signed in April. The pullout is to be completed in February. The guerrillas, who launched their insurgency after a Communist coup in 1978, have said they will keep up the war until the government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> is defeated. <PERSON> Gul </PERSON> said agricultural production in 1986 fell to 45 percent of the level in 1978, the year before the Soviet intervention. Good rains last spring brought production up to 53 percent of its 1978 level, he said. The survey said it will take at least three years and $ 4 billion to restore cropland and livestock affected by 10 years of fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Other officials have said such reconstruction could take 10 to 20 years. Farmers told the researchers that the Afghan army burned crops and shot cattle and sheep, sometimes from helicopter gunships. Hundreds of farmers said more than five animals a year in their herds were blown up by land mines, according to the report. Other farmers told researchers they sold livestock to pay for food or transportation out of the country. The Swedish-financed survey was conducted by a team of Afghan researchers who returned to their home areas to question 20,000 farmers. The results are designed to help aid projects and resettle more than 5 million refugees after Soviet troops leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The 68-page report says food production improved in 1986 after the U.S.-supplied guerrillas received anti-aircraft missiles, `` providing a protective umbrella and allowing agricultural operations to continue during daytime.'' <PERSON> Gul </PERSON> said the survey was conducted only in guerrilla-held areas but included all 29 provinces. At least two of the 68 researchers escaped an ambush by government troops and another was captured and imprisoned. Six who were sent to remote provinces still have not reported back, <PERSON> Gul </PERSON> said. The researchers used questionnaires to collect details on war damage, crop yields, irrigation and use of fertilizers. The results showed that among farmers who fled <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1987, 42 percent reported their cattle, sheep or goats had been shot to death or killed by mines, and 65 percent of the farmers said their crops were burned. The report recommended a phased return of the refugees timed to the distribution of food aid and the rebuilding of the Afghan farms. Most of the refugees have fled to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Reconstruction will be slow, said <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>. `` It's not only a question of money. It's a matter of time just for oxen to reproduce. You need three years to produce high quality seed,'' he said. Political obstacles also will delay rehabilitation, said <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> <PERSON> Fange </PERSON> of the Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, which paid for the $ 870,000 project. `` No matter what kind of government there will be, it will be very weak,'' said <PERSON> Fange </PERSON>, who is based in the refugee camps at <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Fragmentation of authority between the government and local guerrilla commanders will make the distribution of aid extremely complicated, he said.

<HEAD>INS Gets Tough Wednesday on Employers Who Hire Illegal Aliens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After today, there'll be no more automatic warnings for businesses that hire illegal aliens. Instead, they face stiff fines from a no-longer-forgiving Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. From the loftiest Fortune 500 company to the smallest corner grocery store, companies tempted to look the other way when aliens apply could find themselves hit where it hurts _ the company coffers. Employers who violate the 1986 law barring the hiring of illegal immigrants now automatically get warning citations for the first offense. But on June 1, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has the discretion to issue a citation or a fine. It is a system that has worked in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and many feel it offers the best hope to curb illegal immigration and transfer jobs from aliens to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. But others worry about possible exploitation of illegal workers, discrimination against foreign-appearing workers, the impact on the labor force and the dangers of turning employers into immigration police. Employers face fines of up to $ 1,000 for improper documentation, up to $ 2,000 per alien for a first offense of knowingly hiring an illegal alien, up to $ 5,000 per alien for the second offense, $ 10,000 for subsequent offenses, and $ 3,000 or six months in jail for a `` pattern or practice'' of violation. Over the past year, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> fined 80 businesses $ 350,000 and issued 2,000 citations. The agency thus views the new phase not as a dramatic crackdown, but as a nudge to employers. `` Our intent is not to indiscriminately run around fining employers. The intent is to encourage employers to validate their work force,'' says <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>. `` It'll be a deliberate implementation of the law.'' <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> says the agency will use its resources `` judiciously,'' targeting the construction, garment and hotel and service industries that have traditionally been repositories of illegal workers. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where many countries adopted employer sanctions a decade ago, the system did not trigger widespread job discrimination against foreigners, according to a 1987 study by the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, a private think tank that researches immigration trends. <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamp </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, labor attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, says businesses are `` afraid that the law has significant teeth in it.'' The chamber is conducting a survey to determine how the law is working. Some experts have made preliminary assessments. `` Employer sanctions will probably work best in the larger firms and will work least effectively as you get down to the mom and pop enterprises that do n't pay much anyhow and need the cheap -LRB- illegal -RRB- labor to survive,'' says <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Simcox </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. The amnesty phase of the 1986 law, in which illegal aliens who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before 1982 could apply for temporary residency, enlarged the pool of legal workers available for low-paying jobs. Employers `` have got the windfall of having additional pools of low-wage workers, which means they do n't have to modernize or raise wages in order to make jobs more attractive,'' says <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a labor economist at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The potential for worker exploitation concerns civil liberties advocates. The law `` grandfathered'' in workers who had jobs on Nov. 6, 1986, the date it was passed. That means that employers did not have to ask those workers for documents, although illegal workers in that category remain subject to deportation if caught by INS. Now, the worry is that those workers can be trapped in their jobs with no redress against an unscrupulous employer. There is also the issue of job discrimination. The law bars employers from refusing to hire someone because of their national origin or, in the case of someone who has taken steps to become a citizen, his citizenship status. It sets up a special <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> counsel to prosecute complaints. But the law also allows employers to hire <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens over non-citizens `` if the two individuals are equally qualified.'' `` That's going to make it even more difficult to prove discrimination. ` Equally qualified' is to a certain degree subjective,'' says <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Educational Fund, which provides legal assistance to Mexican-Americans and others involved in employment discrimination suits or complaints. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, an investigative branch of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, last fall found little evidence that employers were discriminating against foreign-looking job applicants because of the new law. But those findings are only preliminary.

<HEAD>Analyst Suggests Separate Bureau For Environmental Statistics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's environmental statistics are a disgrace, with billion-dollar decisions turning on the readings of a handful of monitoring instruments, says a veteran <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> environmental analyst calling for a <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. Such a bureau could direct attention and spending to needed areas, avoid costly unnecessary programs and keep bureaucrats honest, writes <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Portney </PERSON>, vice president of Resources for the Future and director of the organization's Center for Risk Management. The group studies environmental policy but does not engage in lobbying. `` We currently do a disgraceful job of collecting, analyzing and disseminating information about environmental conditions and trends,'' <PERSON> Portney </PERSON> said in a paper written for his organization and distributed last week. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, assistant administrator for policy and planning at the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Portney </PERSON> had a good idea. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, she said, collects `` tons of statistics'' under its regulations, but `` we are only beginning to think about'' how data-gathering should be organized and who should do it. Environmental statistics are gathered by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and several other parts of the government. Government simply could not work without the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and other respected, professional statistics agencies, <PERSON> Portney </PERSON> said. An annual report of the president pulls together 100 different economic data series dating back to 1929. For the environment, no one puts it all together, even though the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION>, a White House agency severely downgraded by the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, is charged by statute with collecting and publishing environmental statistics. `` Even in its halcyon days, however, the <ORGANIZATION> CEQ </ORGANIZATION> was never able to muster the resources to present truly comprehensive and consistent environmental data on an annual basis,'' <PERSON> Portney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Portney </PERSON> guessed that $ 200 million a year is spent on economic statistics, `` very small in comparison to the $ 75 billion or more that we spend to comply with <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> regulations alone.'' He said he did not know what his proposed bureau should spend or where it should be placed, but it should have statutory independence like the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> were a separate line in <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s annual budget, appropriations for data collection and analysis could not easily by siphoned off. This now happens regularly when the program offices in whose budgets monitoring funds are now included are given additional regulatory responsibilities for which no funds are available,'' <PERSON> Portney </PERSON> wrote. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> judges compliance with some clean air standards by peak one-hour readings from the highest-reading monitor in an area. Sanctions, rare so far, could cost an area hundreds of millions of dollars. `` The temptation to shut monitors down at strategic times for maintenance or to relocate them to more ` convenient' sites could be considerable,'' <PERSON> Portney </PERSON> wrote. `` While there is no evidence to suggest that our national air quality data have been compromised in this way, it is only now that the non-attainment sanctions have become a serious possibility. A credible, independent federal presence is badly needed to guard against this possibility.'' Several reports suggest that in checking compliance with 55-miles per hour speed limit, states played similar games to avoid loss of highway aid _ locating radar guns on hills, in congested areas and so forth so that reported speeds would be low and unrepresentative of actual speeds.

 A boat carrying eight people capsized during a Memorial Day outing, killing six young women aboard the overloaded craft and a man who tried to rescue them, authorities said. The operator of the 16-foot, aluminum boat was able to swim ashore and one person on the craft was rescued, authorities said. The operator, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, 32, said the boat's occupants were on a slow `` joy ride,'' splashing water on each other when the accident occurred the on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tillatoba </LOCATION> on Monday afternoon. `` One girl leaned over when the boat was turning and some water started coming in the boat and everybody panicked,'' said <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, who acknowledged that the boat was overloaded. `` Everybody stood up and started moving around in the boat. Then it turned over. They was just hollering ` Help! Help! Help!' Could n't none of them swim.'' Three of the girls held hands when the boat overturned and were still holding hands when their bodies were recovered, <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said Monday night. <ORGANIZATION> Yalobusha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coroner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> True </ORGANIZATION> identified the drowning victims as boat occupants <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 21; her 20-year-old sister, <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON>; their cousin, <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 20; <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 21; <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, 19. <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Rounds </PERSON>, 41, died after swimming from the shore in a rescue attempt, the coroner said. Another passenger, <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pernell </PERSON>, whose age was unavailable, was clinging to the boat when he was rescued by a fisherman, said <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pernell </PERSON> was in stable condition at <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> Lake Medical Center. The boat had traveled about 30 yards from the shore of the 25-acre lake, located on <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> 330 between the rural communities of <LOCATION> Coffeeville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tillatoba </LOCATION> in north-central <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, when the accident occurred, said the County Sheriff's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> The coroner said the bodies were recovered in eight to 10 feet of water near the boat, and no alcohol was involved. The flat-bottom boat was powered by a 25-horsepower outboard motor and was designed to hold up to five people, said Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>. `` It was kind of loaded but we was going slow, though,'' <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said. `` They was playing in the water. That's what caused the accident.'' The cause of the accident was under investigation, authorities said. True said no life jackets were on the boat, but <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said there were two, although neither was worn. `` I told them to hold onto the boat and do n't panic,'' said <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, who can swim. `` When I'd get one, there another would turn loose and grab me. I did all I could. I got welts all over my back now. I went under a lot of times. `` There were about 35 or 40 people on the shore and I was saying, ` Somebody help us.' People on the shore kind of panicked. A couple people fainted. `` When <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> jumped in to help them -LRB- boat occupants -RRB-, they just grabbed him and he drowned, too.'' <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said he struggled for about 30 minutes to save the others until he could do no more, and barely made it to shore himself. True said the deaths were ruled accidental.

<HEAD>IMF Reports Some of Its Programs Hurt the Poor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A report from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> acknowledges that poor people have been hurt by policies it has pressed on Third World countries with the support of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In the past the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> has stressed that countries will be worse off if they delay the austerity policies such as devaluation of currencies and cuts in government spending usually required as a condition for <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> loans. The fund is owned by 151 governments, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> holding the biggest block of votes. At the end of March, poor countries owed the fund $ 28.6 billion. Though founded in an effort to keep all currencies stable, in recent years the fund has spent its money almost entirely on helping about 80 poor countries keep up with their debt, much of it owed to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and banks. `` Although many of the major policy instruments improved the position of the dominant poverty groups in the sample countries, other poverty groups were made worse off in the short run,'' the new report says. It chooses seven sample countries whose governments in recent years have adopted `` adjustment programs'' in order to get loans from the fund: <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. The authors are five members of the fund staff led by an American, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>. The fund distributed the report this week from its headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The statement that introduces it comes from <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>, the fund's French managing director: `` Adjustment does not have to lower basic human standards. ... The more -LRB- that -RRB- adjustment efforts give proper weight to social realities _ especially the implications for the poorest _ the more successful they are likely to be.'' Large groups of poor people in the cities of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> suffered from devaluations, it says. For the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, the report tells how spending on health and schools was cut, devaluation and restrictions on imports raised prices sharply while restrictions on the supply of money held down the number of jobs and the amount of wages. In the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, basic items were subsidized by a high exchange rate for the peso. When the rate was lowered there was what the report calls `` major social unrest.'' More than 50 people died in the Dominican rioting of 1984. Sharp cuts in government spending may have hurt the poor in the long run as well as the short run in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, according to the report. But it adds that the cuts might have been even greater if there had been no agreement between the governments and the fund. A rise in the tax on beer hit the people of <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, `` though not perhaps in welfare terms,'' the report adds. On the positive side, the report says fund programs brought more credit for poor farmers in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and the removal of price controls helped cut rents in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>. It also says that lowering the exchange rate helped increased the real earnings of poor people in the country who were raising crops for export in <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, and to a lesser extent in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Party Conservatives Preventing Reformers From Attending Crucial
Conference</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A leading reformer says he expects <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s liberalization drive to prevail at next month's crucial party conference despite conservatives' success at blocking some of its backers from attending. The Soviet leader's `` policies and programs are sufficiently strong to carry the conference,'' prominent political scientist <PERSON> Fyodor </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> said Monday. He is among those who have been excluded. The Communist Party conference, the first since 1941, will lay out a a slate of policy decisions and proposals forming a blueprint for legislative changes. It will amount to passing judgment on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s wide-ranging program of social and economic reforms known as `` perestroika.'' The selection of the 5,000 delegates to the June 28 conference has already turned into a showdown between backers of reform and those who seek to limit change _ often to preserve their privileges. <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> said the conference will not name any new people to the 300-member, policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, in part to protect the committee headed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> from changes viewed as harmful. `` If elections to the party conference have become so difficult, how do we know elections to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> wo n't be tied up by some of these negative factors?'' he asked. <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> fell with the fortunes of <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, the late former premier, but resurfaced to back <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` perestroika'' campaign He said the party's charter does not spell out procedures for selecting delegates to party conferences: `` We are learning democracy, finding a style as we go. It is certainly experimental.'' Since the last party conference was in 1941, times have changed radically and old ways of choosing delegates are no longer relevant, the political scientist said. Instances where <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s backers failed to get elected as delegates were sometimes the result of individual party officials striking the backers' names from lists forwarded by factories, institutes and local party organizations, <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> said. `` There were cases where regional secretaries themselves, for formalistic reasons, withdrew certain names,'' he said, using a term that suggests conservatism. <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON>; historian <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Tatyana </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaslavskaya </PERSON>, a prominent sociologist are among those turned down by regional party authorities after being selected by their local groups as candidates to attend the conference. Exclusion of such noted backers of reform prompted demonstrations in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> over the weekend and accusations that the selection process was rigged. Ms. <PERSON> Zaslavskaya </PERSON> criticized the delegate selection process at a news conference last week, saying the choices had not in every case been beneficial for the fate of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> joked that his own absence would take its toll at the party conference, `` but I do n't think it is dangerous to perestroika.'' Among the proposals are suggestions for jury trials; relaxation of restrictions on religion; reform of the criminal justice system; limits on the political terms of party officials, and some formal sanctioning of the informal groups springing up in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> said now number about 30,000. The groups, which are unofficial but sometimes tolerated, have come together to press causes like environmental protection and individual freedoms.

 When <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> mingles with some of the seedier characters in the nation's capital, it's all in a day's work As the wife of Rep. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., she does what is expected of a congressional spouse: showing up at parties and receptions, posing for pictures and answering reporters' questions But the mother of eight has another life in what seems like another world. <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> is a private detective. `` So much for stereotypes,'' she said, laughing about the contrast of life in the public eye and work as a private eye. `` I guess I must be a maverick.'' `` But if my life had to revolve strictly around <PERSON> Phil </PERSON>, waiting for him to come home every night, I think I'd go crazy,'' she added. `` You have to have diversion, and I get plenty of it.'' Since graduating from a detective school in suburban <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> seven years ago, Mrs. <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> said she has handled at least 50 cases ranging from the search for a missing person to gathering evidence for a divorce case. `` It can be dirty. It's often seedy. But it's always challenging,'' she said recently. `` It's also amazing who you have to consort with. `` I could recall a few unsavory characters along the way. But you have to do it. ... If you do n't ingratiate yourself to some of these low-lives, there are times you just wo n't get the answers you need.'' She said another part of the job, surveillance, dispels any impression that detective work is glamorous. `` In one case, the husband knew his wife was having an affair, and he was certainly right. We got the goods,'' she said. `` But it was 23 -LCB- hours straight, sitting in a car _ not getting out, not even to go to the bathroom. `` I'll never forget it as long as I live. In fact, I do n't think I'll ever wear those clothes again.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> began as a full-time detective with an agency when she received her diploma. She now works part time as a freelance investigator, often for lawyers, because she wanted more freedom. She was reluctant to talk about most of her recent investigations, largely background checks, but said her clients never include members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Does she carry a gun? `` I could, but I do n't. I ca n't even think of a time when I needed to,'' she said. `` Ironically, you ca n't carry one in <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, period, unless you get a special dispensation and, even then, it has to be seen. So I'd look a little silly going to a reception with a holster on my belt.'' <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> said he is proud of his wife's atypical occupation, but also finds humor in the situation. `` I bet I'm the only guy on the Hill who would n't get mad if his wife was caught standing outside some stranger's hotel room,'' he said recently.

 Train commuters have felt the future of railroading and it's making them uncomfortable _ and a little motion sick. <ORGANIZATION> NJ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has introduced new seats on about 200 trains that some commuters hate about as much as their commute. They say the seats, which do not adjust like the old ones, force them to ride facing the back sometimes, do not offer enough head support and have wimpy armrests or none at all. The seats do n't even have hand grips on the sides for people who would rather stand Some suspect a plot against the passengers is afoot. `` They made the seat purposely lower on the aisle so the commuter will shove in and use the more comfortable middle seat. I guess they figure nobody wants the middle seat,'' said commuter <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Papp </PERSON>. He also complained when the seats force the passenger to ride backward `` the forces are reversed,'' he said. `` A lot of people apparently do n't care for that, it can even make them motion sick.'' The commuters plan to voice their complaints Wednesday at a meeting of the statewide transportation agency. The seats recently were installed and <ORGANIZATION> NJ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> officials say they are n't inclined to spend the money to replace them. But they scheduled the meeting to discuss what kind of seats to place in 300 other cars that will be bought or refurbished in the next three years. The commuter dissatisfaction surfaced in an NJ Transit-sponsored survey of 2,800 riders.

 A carpenter-turned-author says he's not anti-television, even though his first published book is about a boy who discovers the library when his television set explodes and he has no programs to watch. `` I'd just like to see -LRB- TV -RRB- play a less important part in our lives,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> says he may resign before the November election, but not before he has a chance to `` set the record straight.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said in an interview broadcast Monday night that before he steps aside, he wants to respond to the allegations that have been made against him concerning his ties to scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a $ 1 billion Iraqi pipeline project. An independent counsel who has been investigating <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> for the past year is expected to issue a report in several weeks. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is not expected to be indicted but the report will raise questions about his ethical conduct, according to sources familiar with the probe.

<HEAD>Beijing Beauty Pageant Ends With a Whimper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s first beauty pageant ended with a whimper when organizers named 12 `` Girls of Elegance'' at a hush-hush evening tea party, reports appearing today said. The Sunday tea party ended the strange on-again, off-again saga of the Chinese capital's first beauty contest since the Communists came to power 39 years ago. More than 800 women had signed up to participate after an April announcement that <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> would host a contest to select 10 `` Girls of Youth and Elegance.'' Preliminary rounds narrowed the field to 50 contestants. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> contest ignited beauty pageant fever throughout the country, setting off a debate about whether such contests are appropriate in a country with a low standard of living. Some cities quickly dropped plans to name local beauty queens. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> called off its contest earlier this month, claiming `` conditions were not ripe.'' A `` Mr. <PERSON> Canton </PERSON>'' and `` Miss Canton'' were named Saturday night before a crowd of 5,000 people in the southern city near <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> _ but plans to broadcast the pageant live were scrapped. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studio </ORGANIZATION>, one of two sponsors of the capital's pageant, announced last week that the capital's contest had been canceled. But <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that the pageant would be held as planned June 5, though it would not be televised, reporters would not be allowed to attend and there would be no news conference afterward. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the magazine confirmed today that the pageant had ended with the selection of 12 `` Girls of Elegance'' on Sunday. Reports from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> pro-China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pao </ORGANIZATION> newspaper and the <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> did not say why the June 5 finals were canceled. The news service said the 50 finalists attended the tea party and judges chose 12 `` outstanding competitors who left a relatively deep impression.'' They included three students, a military nurse and an employee of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> International Hotel, the report said. There was no indication what, if anything, the winners were awarded. `` Ending the competition like this is disappointing,'' the news service quoted contestant <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, a student at the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Language </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, as saying. `` I hoped to win, but if I could n't capture first place I hoped someone else would. Another contestant, <PERSON> Yi </PERSON> <PERSON> Xinxin </PERSON>, was quoted as saying, `` Although this round of activity is already finishedm, I'm still very excited. I believe there will come a time when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will host this kind of competition.'' Contestants in the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> pageant were judged on their talent in singling, dancing, reading and answering questions revealing their knowledge and moral values.

 The nation's jobless rate fell to 2.6 percent in April, down from 3 percent for the same month last year, the government reported today. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate would be about twice as high if calculated by Western methods. The seasonally adjusted jobless rate for April was the same as for March of this year, the Management and <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said in its monthly report. Government officials said April's figure reflected a continuing steady economic recovery since last summer following a major shift in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economic structure. The nation has been pushing domestic demand expansion over previously export-led growth. The number of Japanese with jobs in April was 60.38 million, an increase of 1.08 million over the same month last year, according to the report, which was presented to the Cabinet today. It was the first time that the number of employed Japanese topped 60 million, the report said. At the same time, there were 1.66 million people out of work. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s population is about 121 million.

 More than a week of flooding in northern <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> has claimed 41 lives and left about 15,000 people homeless, a Bengali language newspaper reported today. The <PERSON> Khabar </PERSON> newspaper said all the deaths occurred in the <LOCATION> Sylhet </LOCATION> district, about 62 miles north of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, but did not give details. A <LOCATION> Sylhet </LOCATION> district government official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone that only 10 deaths had been reported. But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that at least 50,000 people had been trapped by flood waters in the district. The flooding has been caused by the <LOCATION> Brahmaputra </LOCATION> river bursting its banks. The <LOCATION> Brahmaputra </LOCATION> flows through <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and into the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>. Local newspapers say at least 1.5 million people have had their homes or crops inundated by the floodwaters. Flooding is common at this time of year, when the monsoon rains begin, in this nation of 105 million people. The government says at least 1,500 people were killed in floods last year.

<HEAD>Australia Seizes Huge Arms Cache Bound For Fiji</HEAD>

 Customs officers said today that they seized a huge cache of weapons bound for <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> that could have started a small war in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> nation, scene of two coups last year. The cache, including submachine guns, automatic rifles, hand grenades, mortars and anti-tank mines, arrived on a ship from <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hodeidah </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, said Customs spokesman <PERSON> Alastair </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. He said the shipment, discovered Monday in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>'s downtown Darling Harbor, was bound for <LOCATION> Lautoka </LOCATION>, in eastern <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, stronghold of deposed Prime Minister <PERSON> Timoci </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavadra </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said all the weapons were Soviet-made. `` It has nasty connotations,'' the official said. News reports said it was the biggest illegal haul of military equipment in Australian history. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said consigment papers listed the contents of a more than one-ton container as used machinery. `` Customs officers located the container, opened a number of sealed boxes, and instead of used machinery they found weapons,'' he told a news conference. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said an army demolition squad was brought in to remove the weapons and officials were doing an inventory. He said the shipment contained enough arms to have `` started a small war in <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>.'' News reports said the consignment was intercepted after being loaded onto the french ship Capitaine <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. The reports said the captain and his crew were being questioned but had not been arrested. The Foreign Ministry official said authorities in <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, which is about 2,000 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, had been informed of the seizure. Australian officials said they had no immediate indication of for whom the weapons were bound. In <LOCATION> Suva </LOCATION>, the Fijian capital, authorities expressed surprise at the seizure. <PERSON> Bavadra </PERSON>, who was ousted in a coup a year ago, was not available for comment. There has been no armed resistance by the majority Indian community to the coups, which <PERSON> Sitiveni </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> said he staged to protect the rights of ethnic Fijians, who comprise a 43 percent minority of the islands' 715,000 people. <PERSON> Bavadra </PERSON>'s Indian-dominated elected government was ousted on May 14, 1987, just one month after it came to power. <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> staged a second coup four months later, claiming the interim administration had not settled the issue of Fijian political dominance.

 The degradation and death of a teen-age homosexual prostitute will be the focus in the murder trial of a former university professor who is accused of chopping up his victim with a chain saw. <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nute </PERSON>, a homeless 18-year-old from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, died on Aug. 20. He was shot to death in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> apartment six months after leaving home saying he was going to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to be a movie star. After his death, police say, someone took a chain saw to <PERSON> Nute </PERSON>'s body and hacked it into several pieces, later scattering the parts around <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> The prosecution in the trial scheduled to begin today seeks to prove that the gun that killed <PERSON> Nute </PERSON> and the chain saw with which he was dismembered were wielded by <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Franc </PERSON>. Franc, 58, a former political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Fresno </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, denies being the killer and blames a man named <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. But the prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, says a lengthy investigation of men named <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> only convinced him that Franc invented the person. Franc, who has no criminal record, was arrested Aug. 29 after he returned a chain saw to a rental company with bits of flesh and blood in its inner workings. Franc, who lived in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, also maintained an apartment in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. Pieces of <PERSON> Nute </PERSON>'s body were found near freeways in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION>, 200 miles apart. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> has ruled that jurors in the trial can be shown some photos of the severed body parts. But he said other pictures are too gory to show jurors, who might be so inflamed by them they would convict the defendant without weighing other evidence. <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, scheduled to deliver his opening statement today, said he will try to prove through analysis of decomposition time that Franc refrigerated portions of the body before discarding them. He contends Franc killed <PERSON> Nute </PERSON> in a homosexual rage and dismembered the body to avoid detection. According to counselors in the homosexual community, <PERSON> Nute </PERSON> quickly abandoned his dreams of stardom and wound up working the streets of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> as a homosexual prostitute. He dyed his dark hair blond and wore it in spikes. Franc, a native of <LOCATION> DePere </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, has acknowledged knowing <PERSON> Nute </PERSON> and said he once loaned him money. But he denies killing the youth. Franc resigned his teaching post after his arrest.

<HEAD>Workers Strike Memorial Day At 17 Cemeteries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLMA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Burials were postponed today after union workers struck 17 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area cemeteries in a dispute over non-union subcontractors and health benefits. `` During this strike there wo n't be any interment. Mortuaries will have to hold the bodies,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, weekend manager of Woodlawn Memorial Park in <LOCATION> Colma </LOCATION>. The strikers, however, did not interfere with Memorial Day visitors. In 1985, more than 800 bodies went unburied until a long strike was settled. The main issue in the strike, which began Monday and is the area's fifth cemetery walkout since 1971, was the use of non-union subcontractors, said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaudio </PERSON>, business agent for the <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 265. `` That involves a real threat ... to the future of their jobs, to the union itself,'' said <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaudio </PERSON>, whose union represents 150 workers who are groundskeepers, custodians and handle burials and cremations. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantwell </PERSON>, who represents two associations of cemetery owners, called subcontracting a `` sham issue.'' Cemeteries always have used subcontractors, and the owners associations' proposal says no workers will be laid off because of subcontracting, he said. The union's three-year contract with <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemeteries </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> expired March 1. It covered employees at eight cemeteries east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and nine south on the <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. The only cemetery in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, at the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidio </ORGANIZATION>, was unaffected by the strike. Contract negotiations broke off Saturday, and no new talks are scheduled, <PERSON> Cantwell </PERSON> said. At least one cemetery, in <LOCATION> Hayward </LOCATION>, canceled burials scheduled for today. `` The burials will simply have to be postponed,'' <PERSON> Cantwell </PERSON> said. Cemetery workers receive $ 14.35 an hour after 18 months, <PERSON> Cantwell </PERSON> said. Under the employers' proposal, employees would receive raises of 30 cents an hour for each year of the contract, he said. Employers also are offering to pay the same amount for employee health insurance as under the previous contract, <PERSON> Cantwell </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Bahamas Helps US Anti-Drug Efforts as Pindling Indictment Seems
Less Likely</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> has become more cooperative with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in an anti-drug effort, while chances are diminishing that the islands' prime minister will face a drug indictment in this country, a newspaper reports. The <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> government has joined the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in combined drug raids and allowed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs base on Gun Cay south of <LOCATION> Bimini </LOCATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. `` We're at a very high level of cooperation at this point,'' said Customs spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>'s statement was echoed by <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. But chances that the prime minster, Sir <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>, could be prosecuted on drug-related charges appear remote because of obstacles in an ongoing probe of an overseas drug-smuggling network. First, the shaky status of federal drug indictments in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has raised doubts about whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would want to indict a foreign head of state. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration reportedly has offered to drop the indictments in a deal in which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would step down from power. `` I find very little incentive indicting foreign potentates if the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> can negotiate them right out from under my feet,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, who has indicated he'll quit if the indictment against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is dropped <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, has refused to comment on the reported probe of <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> said a grand jury in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> is hearing testimony against <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> leader since 1967 who was re-elected last year after his government was rocked by a drug-corruption scandal. The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, citing a `` well-placed source,'' said a July 4 deadline has been set for an indictment of <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>. Another major obstacle, The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> said, is the statute of limitations. <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>'s probe stemmed from testimony given by prosecution witnesses in the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> federal trial of convicted Colombian drug kingpin <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>. Most of the allegations raised against <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> in the <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> trial involved incidents in the late 1970s and 1980, which would put them past the five-year statute of limitations. <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> prosecuted <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, who was accused of using the private Bahamian island of <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay as a cocaine trans-shipment point and was convicted on all drug counts he faced. During <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s trial, <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> called <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> `` a co-conspirator.'' Prosecution witness <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> police were guarding the prime minister when he delivered a suitcase with $ 400,000 to <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> in 1980 for alleged protection of <PERSON> Baron </PERSON>'s marijuana-smuggling through the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>, in a May 4 statement, denied <PERSON> Baron </PERSON>'s story and charges of corruption and bribe-taking. The Bahamian government ran full-page ads May 10 in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> newspapers stressing its commitment to fighting drugs and protesting what they called old allegations. A 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquiry </ORGANIZATION> detailed corruption in lower levels of the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> government and law enforcement, but stopped short of linking <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> to the drug corruption.

 A couple who sailed a canvas-covered kayak from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> survived stormy seas and a water spout that broke their 15-foot vessel's frame before being rescued by a fishing boat, officials said. `` I do n't know how in the world they made it across the ocean,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurgiolo </PERSON>, captain of a charter fishing boat that rescued the couple off <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Matecumbe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Islamorada </LOCATION>. `` It was awfully rough.''

Coast Guard Petty Officer <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON> said he was surprised the couple had survived the more than 100-mile voyage. `` It was not a real seaworthy vessel,'' <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON> said.

After they were taken aboard the Gonfishin 5 passengers on the charter gave them food and clothing, <PERSON> Gurgiolo </PERSON> said. `` She got on the boat, dried off her Bible and praised God,'' the captain said.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar lost ground after opening higher against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today, while stocks gained for the second consecutive day. After opening at 125.21 yen, up 0.23 yen, the dollar lost strength and closed the day at 124.80 yen, down 0.18 yen. `` The dollar ranged between 124.77 and 125.28 yen, sandwiched between buy and sell orders,'' said an exchange dealer with a major <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` The dollar comes under selling pressure when it goes above the 125-yen level, and buy orders start coming in when it falls below that level,'' he said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which gained a strong 260.60 points Monday, added another 193.60 points, or 0.71 percent, to finish the day's trading at 27,416.70. `` Share prices rose substantially just before the end of the afternoon session, led by large-capital issues, such as steels and shipbuildings,'' said <PERSON> Hitoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Otani </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Wako </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. Investors are now less worried about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> econony, <ORGANIZATION> Otani </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Fears about inflation and a rise in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official discount rate have lessened among investors,'' he said. With its rallies on Monday and today, the market erased the big loss suffered on Saturday, when the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index tumbled 327.99 points in a half-day session. Volume on the first section was estimated at 1.7 billion shares, up from 1 billion shares on Monday. Advancing issues included automobiles and precision machineries.

<HEAD>Navy Hero, Wife, Buried Side-By-Side After 168 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A duel took <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> <PERSON> Decatur </PERSON>'s heroic husband from her 168 years ago and fate kept their remains apart until now. Mrs. <PERSON> Decatur </PERSON>'s resting place was dedicated Monday in a church yard next to her husband's grave. Three students from an elementary school named for <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Decatur </PERSON> participated in a wreath-laying ceremony attended by about 100 people. <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> was one of the young <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s heroes, lionized for his feats of daring against North African pirates and for a victory over a British warship during the War of 1812. After he was killed by a duelist's bullet on March 22, 1820, Mrs. <PERSON> Decatur </PERSON> lived 40 years without him. She then lay buried for 128 years in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, while he rested beside his parents at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> here. Through the efforts of <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the remains of Mrs. <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> were removed from a university-owned cemetery, placed in a mahogany coffin and on May 19 reburied beside her husband, who had been buried under a 30-foot-tall granite column. Monday's ceremony coincided with the opening of a small <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> exhibit at the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Maritime Museum. <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> was a native of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, the son of a Revolutionary War naval officer who was reared among the ships and shipbuilders of the city's late 18th-century waterfront. His most intrepid act was his Feb. 7, 1804, burning of the captured <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> frigate <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> in the harbor of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, in modern-day <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Then 25 and disguised as a Maltese sailor, <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> headed a raiding party that sailed into the heavily guarded harbor. They boarded, set fires and destroyed the frigate, which had been seized six months earlier by <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> warships. Two years later, <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> married <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, the daughter of the mayor of <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and a noted belle of that town and <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. She was said to be well educated, charming and pretty, but little else is known about her. They were childless and had been married for 14 years when <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> died in the duel at age 41. <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> was challenged by Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barron </PERSON>, whom <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> had criticized after a ship <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> commanded was severely damaged by a British warship in 1807. The men stood about 8 yards apart in <LOCATION> Bladensburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and fired a pair of ornate, long-barreled silver pistols. <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> was wounded in the hip but recovered. <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> also was shot in the hip but the bullet traveled into his abdomen, and he died in his home that evening. Mrs. <PERSON> Decatur </PERSON> eventually settled near the campus of what is now <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and in 1837 gave the struggling <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> college $ 7,000. She died July 21, 1860, and was buried in a college graveyard that was forgotten until the ground was prepared for a new building in 1954, according to <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meng </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for administration. Her remains were moved to another college cemetery, where they stayed until she was reburied alonside her husband. `` All of the family, and there are quite a number of us, feel very good about this,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Decatur </PERSON> <PERSON> Garnett </PERSON>, 67, of <LOCATION> Kittery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, a great-great-great-niece of <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>. `` It was a romantic marriage. They were extremely romantic and very handsome.''

<HEAD>Tons of Toxic and Explosive Chemicals Found At College</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tons of old chemicals that have turned toxic and potentially explosive were being removed from two buildings at <ORGANIZATION> Hunter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, where they were like `` a time bomb'' in science laboratories, officials said. The discovery of the chemicals, some up to 30 years old, forced the college to close <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and the North Building on May 20, city <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> and school officials said Monday. Among the chemicals found were 25 canisters of explosive and highly reactive chemicals, including ether and picric acid, and 90 canisters of gases, some of which may be poisonous, said department spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Paylo </PERSON>. `` Picric acid, when it crystallizes, can be as explosive as dynamite in small quantities. It is feared throughout labs when it is old,'' Ms. <PERSON> Paylo </PERSON> said, calling the chemicals `` a time bomb.'' College officials learned about the chemicals' presence when the Fire Department discovered ether during an inspection May 11, college spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> said. Subsequent investigations revealed tons of expired chemicals in the buildings' science laboratories and storage rooms, Ms. <PERSON> Paylo </PERSON> said. So far, the spokeswoman said, 135 to 140 rooms have been searched for dangerous chemicals. A hazardous waste removal contractor planned to search all 500 rooms in both buildings today, she said. The police bomb squad and individual contractors have removed some of the dangerous substances, <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Paylo </PERSON> said. `` Some of the gas is still on the premises because it is difficult to find a contractor who will take it,'' she said. The college's policy had been `` to leave the regulation of materials to individual researchers in the labs,'' <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> said. The discovery of the chemicals `` shows that you ca n't leave this important safety-related area to individual people.'' Classes at the college ended for the summer two weeks ago.

 Spring snow fell in parts of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> today as rain showers and thunderstorms dampened much of the nation after spawning floods and tornadoes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Rain over western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> turned into snow in higher elevations, and as much as 3 inches of snow was expected to fall above the 6,000-foot level.

<HEAD>Elderly Catholic Bishop Released From Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An 80-year-old Roman Catholic bishop jailed since 1982 for ordaining priests outside of the official Communist-controlled church has been released, an official said today. Bishop Fan Xueyan, also known as <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fan </PERSON>, was released two or three months ago from the <LOCATION> Shijiazhuang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION> province, just south of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hebei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said in response to a question. The official gave his name only as <PERSON> Li </PERSON>. He said he did not know why <PERSON> Fan </PERSON> was released, his present whereabouts or the state of his health. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> ordained Fan bishop of <LOCATION> Baoding </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION> province in 1951, shortly before <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s new Communist government ordered the Chinese Catholic church to break with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in the name of anti-imperialism. The officially sanctioned <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> that was then formed rejects the authority of the pope and ordains its own bishops. Hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> clerics and laypeople who refused to support the association were arrested in the 1950s and many have been released only in the past 10 years. Fan, among them, was arrested in 1958 and spent 15 years in jail. He was arrested again in 1982 and sentenced to 10 years in jail for allegedly maintaining ties with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and ordaining priests. The government, which under senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> has alternated between relaxation and severity in its policy toward religious dissidents, has shown leniency this year to several elderly Catholic clerics. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most famous Catholic dissident, <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> Bishop <PERSON> Gong </PERSON> <PERSON> Pingmei </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Ignatius </PERSON> <PERSON> Kung </PERSON>, was allowed to fly to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this month for medical treatment. He had been jailed from 1955-85 and parole restrictions were lifted only this year. The Rev. <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hongshen </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu </PERSON>, was paroled from jail in February so he could receive medical care. <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON>, who is believed to be about 72, had been imprisoned from 1955 to 1979 and was arrested again in 1981 for alleged subversive activities. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church claims more than 3 million members. An unknown number of Catholics remain loyal to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and worship is illegal `` house churches.''

 A storm whipped up tornadoes from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and caused flooding that stranded travelers today, while a snowstorm hit the West and strong wind battered the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast, forcing holiday boaters to abandon ship. `` We're just happy to be alive. We saw the waves smash some girls against the rocks,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Redondo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, whose friend's powerboat was overwhelmed by pounding surf and sank at <LOCATION> Goat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Helicopters plucked 17 yachtsmen from a beach at <LOCATION> Goat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> on Monday, while a lifeguard boat rescued three occupants from a boat beached at <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cove </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Lifeguard Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stonier </PERSON> said The stormy seas apparently claimed two victims Sunday, as the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> suspended the search for two people involved in separate boating accidents. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON> was lost when his sailing catamaran capsized off <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was presumed drowned after a boat on which he was riding crashed into a pier near <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> petty officer <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, several boats were damaged and an unoccupied houseboat sank during a weekend storm, <ORGANIZATION> Glen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> rangers said. There were no reports of missing boaters. Heavy rain from thunderstorms caused flooding Monday near <LOCATION> Clovis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portales </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, where police closed roads and several travelers were stranded. The drivers and passengers of 10 to 15 cars stuck near <LOCATION> Portales </LOCATION> were taken to motels or other shelters, said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Mowrer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Portales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preparedness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The thunderstorms also unleashed at least two tornadoes in the area Monday, one about 5 miles south of <ORGANIZATION> Cannon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. No major damage was reported. Tornadoes and hail also were reported in the western <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> panhandle. `` It touched down in open country and has gone back in the clouds,'' said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, a jailer with the <LOCATION> Bailey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's department in <LOCATION> Muleshoe </LOCATION>. `` We have n't had any reports of injuries or damage. We did have reports of baseball-size hail,'' she said. Two tornadoes were reported in southwestern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, but neither did any damage, authorities said. Spring snow fell in parts of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> today, and as much as 3 inches of snow was expected to fall above the 6,000-foot elevation. Elsewhere, a snowstorm dumped up to 10 inches on southern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and up to 6 inches in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, where rangers closed large sections of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> because of the weather. Crews brought snowplows out of hibernation Monday after snow covered Interstate 15 and Highway 89 between <LOCATION> Kaysville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Clearfield </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. `` It just hit real fast,'' said <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> dispatcher in <LOCATION> Ogden </LOCATION>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> guard walked into <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> offices with his attorney and $ 50,000 of $ 2.5 million stolen from an armored car, surrendered and then told agents where to find the rest of the booty, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Jared </PERSON> <PERSON> Layne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, 26, appeared just before 1 a.m. Monday to confess to the May 5 robbery. He was booked and held without bail in the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, pending arraignment today before a federal magistrate. `` We were somewhat surprised,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> special agent <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lund </PERSON>. `` We'd been working on this, and on something like this you generally expect to go out and make an arrest.'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> told authorities where the rest of the stolen cash was hidden and agents recovered all of the money late Monday, <PERSON> Lund </PERSON> said. He declined to say where it was found, except that it was in another state. <PERSON> Lund </PERSON> also would not elaborate on <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s whereabouts for the past 25 days or say whether authorities believed there was an accomplice. `` He had been inside <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and he'd been in some of the surrounding states,'' <PERSON> Lund </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, one of three Wells Fargo guards transporting the money from <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, had been sought since he disappeared the night the $ 2.52 million in $ 100 bills was taken from the truck. Authorities say the armored car pulled in to a convenience store near <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON>, and the two other guards were locked inside by a wedge of wood used to jam the door. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> is charged with three federal felony counts: theft by an agent of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, theft of bank funds and theft from an interstate shipment. <PERSON> Lund </PERSON> said he did not know why the guard turned himself in, but suggested that a nagging conscience probably was a factor. `` No. 1, he does n't have a criminal history. No. 2, I think he probably planned this thing out and said, ` Yeah, I can live without my family for a while. I can go to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ... live luxuriously for a long, long time,''' he said. `` Then he just got to missing these people. I think he might have had some conscience pangs,'' <PERSON> Lund </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Soviet troops evacuated towns south of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> today in their second major retreat from Afghan outposts, leaving government forces to ward off rebel attacks in the strategic area, Western and Soviet diplomatic sources said. Soviet troops left <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION>, 85 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and were heading north toward the Soviet border, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. A Soviet convoy from <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION> reached the outskirts of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> about sunrise today and passed around the edge of the capital, the Western source said. It was not known how many troops were involved. The Western source said the Soviets today were also pulling out of <LOCATION> Gardez </LOCATION>, 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The evacuation of Soviet troops from the area leaves the Afghan army largely unassisted, at least on the ground, against attacks by anti-government guerrillas in the provinces separating <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> from the Pakistani border to the south and southeast. The guerrillas, who have been fighting both Afghan and Soviet troops, have headquarters in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which serves as their conduit for arms supplies by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Soviet withdrawal started May 15 with departure of troops from <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Under an April agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the Soviets are to complete withdrawal by Feb. 15, 1989. When the pullout began, the Soviets had an estimated 115,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. About 10,000 have left so far, according to reports from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The Soviet military intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> started in Dec. 1979 when troops were dispatched to prop up a Soviet-style government in the face of escalating guerrilla attacks. Meanwhile, the guerrillas claimed from their headquarters in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> that they had captured the strategic <LOCATION> Panjsheer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> northeast of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> last Thursday. The claim could not be verified in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Afghan and Soviet officials declined to comment. The guerrillas claimed Afghan and Soviet troops had left the valley and said they controlled the towns of <LOCATION> Rokhah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Anawa </LOCATION>. If true, the guerrillas would hold major vantage points near the Soviet evacuation route north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> leading to the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> tunnel. The guerrillas said the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> was still open to withdrawing Soviet convoys, giving credence to a report from Western diplomatic sources last week that rebels operating in the area were letting the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> through provided that the Soviets go peacefully. A Western source in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said he did not know if the claim was true, but he said the guerrillas had captured <LOCATION> Bazarak </LOCATION>, 6 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Rokhah </LOCATION>, on May 23. <PERSON> Rokha </PERSON> is 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Military analysts from several Western nations, all speaking on condition of anonymity, said guerrillas were now operating within 6 to 12 miles of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>.

 The wounds from the Civil War have not yet healed, according to retired Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON>, who commanded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and whose relatives fought for the <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON>, speaking Monday in a Memorial Day ceremony at <ORGANIZATION> Gettysburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION>, said the three-day Battle of <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> and other confrontations in the Civil War played a crucial role in the evolution of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` A nation is never fully formed,'' <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON> told about 1,000 spectators in the cemetery where President <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> delivered his famed `` Gettysburg Address'' in 1863. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> sought unity and equality, <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON> said. He added that while the states remain united, `` We have not made a completely equal opportunity available to all.'' `` Perhaps the most serious failure in our nation-building effort has been the fate of our land's original inhabitants, the Indians,'' he said. But, he said, many wounds have healed since Union and Confederate troops fought here in what many historians consider the decisive battle of the Civil War. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, as we know it today, is a vibrant national entity ... I believe <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> would be pleased with the American nation of 1988,'' <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON> said, standing near a monument marking the spot where <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> dedicated the cemetery nearly five months after the fighting ended with Confederate troops retreating from northern soil.

<TEXT>
 The Socialists made big gains, the government-leading <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> advanced slightly, and the Communists were the main losers in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s local elections, official results showed today. Newspapers and politicians said the elections strengthened the national five-party coalition of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Premier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ciriaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mita </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed a political shift to the center, and signalled continuing movement on the left from the Communists toward the Socialists. According to final returns from municipal elections Sunday and Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> took 36.8 percent of the vote, up from 35.6 percent in the last local voting in 1983 and 34.9 percent in last June's parliamentary elections. The Socialists made the biggest gains, recording 18.3 percent, compared to 15.3 percent in 1983 and 14.2 percent last summer. The Communists, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s second largest party and the biggest Communist party in the West, got 21.9 percent, a big drop from the 25.8 percent of 1983 and 26.8 percent of last June. Seven million people, about one-fifth of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s electorate, were eligible to vote Sunday and Monday in the elections for city councils in 1,200 cities and towns, and governments in three provinces. The final turnout was put at 86.2 percent. The vote was not expected to affect the balance of power on the national scene, but it gave an indication of the political climate just over a month since <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> formed <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s 48th post-war government _ a five-party coalition of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, Socialists, Social Democrats, Republicans and Liberals. <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s largest newspaper, said in a front-page editorial, `` The real political result is the crossing of votes on the left between the Communists and Socialists, the start of a rebalancing of the Italian left.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, who have dominated <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s post-war politics, noted that it was the first time since 1970 that they have increased their percentage over the previous local election. Another significant result was the poor showing of the far-right neofascist Italian Social Movemement, which slipped to 3.9 percent from 5 percent in 1983 and 6.8 in the national election last summer. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Repubblica </PERSON> said the losses of the Communists and the far-right were evidence that `` like in all economically mature countries, our electorate is moving to the center of the political sphere and abandoning the areas further away from the point of balance.''

The officials, including one doctor, hoped to visit every political prisoner in the Communist country during their stay, expected to last about one month, <PERSON> Bauverd </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The delegation planned to visit all of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s prisons, <PERSON> Bauverd </PERSON> said. Cuban authorities say there are 15. <PERSON> Bauverd </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> officials had agreed to the standard <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> procedures of visiting prisoners without witnesses and reserving the right to repeat visits in the future. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> would not have an exact number of political prisoners in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> until after the visit. However, according to published reports, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government has said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> would be allowed to visit 323 prisoners, described as `` counter-revolutionaries,'' or state-security prisoners. <PERSON> Bauverd </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> team would give a confidential report to the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government after the visit and that its contents would not be made public under <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> policy. In a related development, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> announced today the composition of a team of delegates from its <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> who are to visit <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> later this year. The six-member team will be headed by the commission chairman, <PERSON> Alioune </PERSON> <PERSON> Sene </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>. It includes delegates from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Therese </PERSON> <PERSON> Gastaut </PERSON> told a weekly briefing. Ms. <PERSON> Gastaut </PERSON> said a date for their visit had not been set. <PERSON> Sene </PERSON> said in March that the visit would probably take place in July or August. The <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> decided at its annual meeting earlier this year to accept an invitation from <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s government to send a delegation to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to investigate the human rights situation there and report back to next year's commission, which begins in February. The decision followed allegations by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and some international organizations, including <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, of human rights violations in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, such as torture and mistreatment of political prisoners. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, which was an observer to the commission last year, was elected last week to sit on the 1989 commission.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today signed an accord providing that each superpower will notify the other of the time, place and intended target of intercontinental-range missile tests. But that agreement, signed in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> looked on, is only a slice of the unfinished Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -LRB- START -RRB-. That accord remains elusive, although both <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, answering reporters' questions at the outset of their day of summit talks, voiced fresh optimism that it can be achieved. The testing accord is what has come to be called a confidence-building measure. Last weekend, senior <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials said it was snagged in a dispute with the Soviets, who wanted a broader agreement. The differences were worked out by senior <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators, under the direction of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, along with another agreement, providing for joint tests this summer in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and at <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet devices to measure the force of blasts. Asked why <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not sign the pacts, <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, the Soviet foreign ministry spokesman quipped. `` It's too small for them It ` s important, but not that important.'' The White House spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, called the pre-notification accord `` a practical new step designed to reduce the risk of misinterpretation, miscalculation, or accident.'' The notice of a test launching must be given at least 24 hours in advance and will be made through risk-reduction centers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. A third accord extending for three years and expanding U.S-Soviet cultural exchanges was signed by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, and by Soviet Culture Minister <PERSON> Vasuky </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamharov </PERSON>. Six other agreements were signed later at the foreign ministry. One gives fishermen in the two countries access to each other's waters Another provides for cooperation between the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and the Soviets in search and rescue operations. A third extends cooperation in radio navigation techniques. A fourth agreement extend a 1973 accord for peaceful uses of atmomic energy. Another sets up five working groups to explore cooperation in solar and other outer space programs. A sixth calls for cooperation in transportation. `` You see the harvest,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told reporters with a smile. Asked when the START treaty would be ready, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said negotiating the terms was `` a hard job.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> added: `` Generally speaking, it's in the fall that we collect the harvest.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> signed all six accords for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> signed four for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The fisheries agreement was signed by <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotlyar </PERSON>, the fisheries minister, while <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolstykh </PERSON>, chairman of the state committee for science and technology, signed the transportation accord. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> then resumed their negotiations. Negotiators working on arms control, human rights, bilateral and regional issues met this morning and were to report their progress later in the day to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Shevernadze, officials said. Two senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, briefing reporters separately under rules which barred disclosure of their names, scaled down an optimistic account by <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> of progress toward resolving other arms control disputes. Nor was there any sign from either side of a breakthrough on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> program to develop a defense in space against ballistic missiles. Even if other issues are resolved, the Soviets have refused to complete the START treaty until the Star Wars dispute is resolved. `` The two sides could not convince each other,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. The Soviets and many American analysts contend the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> program threatens the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. It limits defenses on the theory a potential aggressor would be inhibited if he faced the prospect of devastating retaliation. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration argues the program is not in conflict with the treaty. On START, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cleared the way to removing one of five major obstacles to a treaty, dropping a demand for a ban on mobile missiles. But the senior White House official disagreed, saying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position `` at this point is a ban on mobiles missile. We are still discussing it.'' Soviet officials said before the summit that they thought the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was ready to agree to allow mobile missiles if they could be restricted to a specific area and monitored by spy satellites and possibly through on-site inspection. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told reporters that `` mostly all the questions of verification have been agreed upon ... about the territory where these missiles are going to be stationed.'' But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said `` we have n't heard a verification scheme that could work.'' Evidently, there was progress on counting cruise missiles aboard warplanes, though <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> again was more upbeat than the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official. One American official reported some progress but no breakthrough on the counting rules, and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would consider any scheme the Soviets propose for verifying compliance on ceilings for mobile land-based intercontinental ballitic missiles. The Soviets have deployed two mobile missiles, the SS-24 and SS-25. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is developing one of its own, the Midgetman. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> complained that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was balking at a Soviet proposal to remove a third obstacle to the START accord, verifying limits on the number of cruise missiles carried by ships and submarines. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has rejected conducting an experiment the Soviets say will demonstrate a technology to detect the presence of nuclear weapons aboard warships by detecting the emission of neutrons and gamma rays. `` We think this is not a serious approach at all,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. `` Send us two warships and we will tell you which one of them carries these nuclear weapons without touching them.''

<TEXT>
 The owner of a storage company discovered a suitcase crammed with $ 90,000 in cash in a rental compartment after the renter stopped paying the monthly fees, police said. `` It's difficult to understand why somebody would not pay a $ 45 monthly fee and leave $ 90,000 lying around unless something suspicious was involved,'' Lt. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimble </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Nashville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s armed robbery division said Sunday. In December, a man rented the garage-like storage unit apparently under a fake name and address, police said. Company log-in sheets show no one has visited the unit since Dec. 18, two days after it was rented. When the renter became three months late on his rent, the company sent him a letter, but it was returned as undeliverable. `` When your 90 days late on your rent, they send you a registered letter advising you that if you do n't pay, they will inventory the stored items and auction them off at public sale,'' <PERSON> Kimble </PERSON> said. On Sunday, the owner of the storage business unlocked the unit. `` He found a suitcase with a little over $ 90,000 in wrapped $ 10 and $ 20 bills,'' <PERSON> Kimble </PERSON> said. `` It was really filled up.'' The unit also contained a police radio scanner, an empty plastic cooler and three or four hampers full of adult and children's clothing, <PERSON> Kimble </PERSON> said Police say the money will be held in the department's property room until the rightful owner is found.

<TEXT>
 Banks, schools, restaurants, gas stations and other businesses closed today in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rmaeil </LOCATION> district to protest a car bombing that killed 20 people and wounded 78. Christian militia leaders blamed Monday's bombing on <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Police estimated the car that blew up in a crowded street in <LOCATION> Rmaeil </LOCATION> was packed with more than 200 pounds of TNT. Charred corpses wrapped in nylon bags were turned over to the victims' relatives at the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georges </ORGANIZATION>' Greek Orthodox hospital for burial, police said. `` The victims will be buried separately because they come from different villages and areas,'' said a police spokesman, who can not be identified under standing regulations. He said the Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia, had banned a mass funeral, adding: `` They do n't want a large crowd gathered at one place. It will be too tempting a target for another terrorist attack.'' The bomb exploded about 500 yards from an office of Christian President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. It shattered facades of eight apartment buildings, badly damaged 20 others and wrecked at least 30 cars. The bombing came four days after Syrian troops moved into the slums of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, ending three weeks of bloody clashes between Shiite Moslem militias in which nearly 300 people were killed and 1,000 wounded. The Lebanese Forces blamed <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> for the bombing. <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pakradouni </PERSON>, the militia's second in command, told a news conference: `` The day before yesterday -LRB- Saturday -RRB-, we received the propaganda message. Today -LRB- Monday -RRB- we received the bloody message.'' He referred to a statement Saturday by Information Minister <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, who said presidential elections in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> would only be possible this summer if the Lebanese Forces withdrew from east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> deployed about 2,400 troops in the slums of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Friday and Saturday to end street battles between the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and the Syrian-supported Amal militias. The police spokesman said about 40 percent of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s estimated 250,000 population who fled the fighting had returned to the devastated area since the Syrians moved in to enforce a cease-fire Government buses resumed services in the area today after bulldozers removed earth barricades used by the feuding factions for combat positions. In December 1985, <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> torpedoed a Syrian-brokered peace treaty intended to end <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war. <PERSON> Pakradouni </PERSON> maintained <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> wants the Lebanese Forces out of east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to facilitate the election of a pro-Syrian president and to extend <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s control over the whole country Syrian forces now control Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, most of the capital's southern slums and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s eastern and northern provinces. Most of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Moslems, who have been at war with the Christians since 1975, are backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Fraternity Penalized For Flying Too-Large U.S. Flag</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUBURN, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fraternity members have been ordered to perform community service at a veterans hospital for flying a huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag in violation of a rule aimed at stopping another fraternity from displaying a Confederate banner. `` I do n't want to cause any problems,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, president of the Tau Kappa Epsilon chapter. `` We just want to fly the American flag.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Interfraternity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> ordered <ORGANIZATION> Tau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kappa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epsilon </ORGANIZATION> members to work at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tuskegee </LOCATION> after they flew the 18-by-12 foot flag during a party. The incident violated a 3-year-old school rule designed to block the <ORGANIZATION> Kappa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> fraternity from draping its house with a huge Confederate battle flag. Under the rule, fraternities are barred from flying flags larger than 5 feet by 7 feet. School officials enacted the flag rule in 1985 amid protests by black students, who claimed that the Confederate banner hung on the front of the <LOCATION> Kappa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION> house symbolized racial oppression. Tau <PERSON> Kappa </PERSON> <PERSON> Epsilon </PERSON> is challenging the flag rule, and a university committee on fraternities and sororities will likely consider revamping the guideline, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, assistant dean of students, said Monday. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, chairman of the fraternity court, told The <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plainsman </ORGANIZATION>, the university's student newspaper, that `` none of us had a problem with them flying the flag'' at the April 28 party. But, he said, some action had to be taken because the rule against oversized flags was violated. `` It was an awkward situation because you do n't want to fine a fraternity for flying the American flag,'' he said.

 When a group of Cub Scouts set out to lay a wreath at the foot of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s statue, they did n't expect him to return their salute But at least he could have looked their way.

<HEAD>Delegates Demand ``General Overhaul'' Of The Party</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Delegates at a national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference today demanded `` a general overhaul'' of the party and replacement of those leaders who have led the country into its worst economic and social crisis in postwar history. `` The party needs a general overhaul, and that process has to start with the presidium -LRB- Politburo -RRB- of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Boro </PERSON> <PERSON> Avramovic </PERSON>, a delegate from the largest republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, said during the third day of the conference. Other delegates blamed their leaders for failing to implement changes to ease the nation's crisis. `` It is unlikely that those people who have led us into this crisis will be able to bring us out of it,'' said <PERSON> Rade </PERSON> <PERSON> Milicevic </PERSON>, another Serbian delegate. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has been wrestling with a $ 21 billion foreign debt and unsuccessful attempts to lower its 170 percent inflation and 15 percent unemployment. The government Saturday announced austerity measures _ including an almost 24 percent devaluation of the national currency and lifting of price controls _ to combat the economic crisis. But growing labor unrest in protest of the new program is threatening the current Communist government. <PERSON> Luka </PERSON> <PERSON> Miletic </PERSON>, a delegate from <LOCATION> Zagreb </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> people `` increasingly insist'' that the entire Communist leadership should be replaced for failing to implement the necessary reforms. Several delegates today called for a special party congress to be held by the end of this year in order to replace the current leadership. `` We do n't need a special congress,'' <PERSON> Zvonimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrabar </PERSON>, head of the state-run trade unions, said today. `` What we need is action,'' he added. Party conferences are largely advisory in nature and are intended to help the ruling party deal with problems arising between two party congresses. Party congresses, held every four years in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, have broad powers to make changes in personnel and party organization. <PERSON> Vilma </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancek </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s economically most advanced republic of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, opposed calls for a special <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION>, saying it would be `` a waste of time and money.'' `` Those who demand a special congress should have the courage to propose the replacement of the party presidium,'' she said, `` since the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has the power to recall members of the presidium'' without holding a special congress. `` Young people are reluctant to join the Communist party because they have no confidence in our organization,'' said <PERSON> Metka </PERSON> <PERSON> Tekavcic </PERSON>, a Slovenian delegate. Party members account for less than 10 percent of the country's population of 23 million, and their number is rapidly dropping The official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> publication <PERSON> Komunist </PERSON> said recently that 50 percent of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s young generation shows repulsion toward party membership, compared with 10 percent seven years ago. Komunist attributed this to the general disillusionment with the party after nearly 10 years of economic decline.

 Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> today said he opened a dialogue with Palestinians, including supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, because the Arabs should now realize their uprising in the occupied lands has failed. `` I have met with those thought to be tending more to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. I intend to continue meeting with people who represent different layers and points of view,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> met Monday with four local <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders, the second such session in less than a week. `` It is only natural that at this stage of, I hope, the start of a thought that by stones and firebombs they can achieve nothing, there's a place to start a dialogue,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said today. The Palestinian leaders presented <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> with a list of requests to ease restrictions and what they termed `` collective punishment measures'' in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> participants said. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said he told the Palestinians that `` the more we move towards quiet, the lighter would be the means used ... and ... we have no intention to take revenge when what they call the intifada -LRB- Arab for uprising -RRB- is over.'' But Palestinian participants said <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> could not predict any significant political movement. `` The minister said the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> initiative has missed the train and we ca n't expect anything'' from the U.S.-Soviet <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, said <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> health services. He also quoted <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> as saying `` until the elections in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and maybe six months after ... we can not expect an active political process to start.'' An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier, meanwhile, was indicted Monday on a charge of manslaughter in the killing of an Arab in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the army command said. The Maariv newspaper said the soldier shot the Arab from a distance of about two feet while talking to him. The occupied territories were mostly quiet after Monday's less than successful strike. It faltered when thousands of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> ignored orders by underground leaders to stay away from their jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Since violent protests began in the occupied lands on Dec. 8, 198 Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed. The Israeli-owned news agency <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> quoted Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as saying Monday that the end of the uprising is in sight. `` The dying down of the violence is clear and certain,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the agency. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s chief rival, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, also said in remarks broadcast on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio that <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> were starting to question the value of the uprising. He said they were asking: `` Where does all this lead to? What are all these strikes, stones and bottles?'' <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> businessman who participated in Monday's meeting with <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, said: `` It was a good thing to meet with him and exchange ideas.'' Other participants in the meeting included <PERSON> Othman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallak </PERSON>, editor of the An Nahar newspaper in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, head of the health services in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> said the meeting was requested by <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>. `` We talked briefly about the situation, the uprising,'' <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> said. `` It was a discussion of domestic affairs, nothing political.'' The Palestinians, according to <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, asked <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> to free all the Arab detainees, especially students supposed to attend classes, to stop demanding tax payment certificates for official transactions and to ease restrictions limiting the sums the Arabs are allowed to bring into the country. `` <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> promised to examine that question individually and to check closely the cases of arrests,'' <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know if these promises are going to be fulfilled. He said it depends on how far the uprising will go.'' The army, meanwhile, said that Pvt. <PERSON> Yakov </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamir </PERSON> confessed and was indicted on Monday in the killing an Arab on Jan. 10 in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The military court verdict was expected Sunday, it said. <PERSON> Maariv </PERSON> wrote that <PERSON> Tamir </PERSON> started to talk to a Palestinian after a car he was traveling in was stoned. Passengers in the vehicle, the newspaper said, began to incite <PERSON> Tamir </PERSON> and he shot the Arab in the stomach. The army declined comment.

<HEAD>Compatriot Of Mathias Rust Flies Into Soviet Airspace On

<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A small West German plane crossed the Norwegian border into <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> air space a year after the dramatic flight by <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Red Square, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said today. Spokesman <PERSON> Lasse </PERSON> <PERSON> Seim </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 150 was on its way from <LOCATION> Ivalo </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kirkenes </LOCATION> in the northeast corner of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> on Saturday when the pilot strayed over Soviet territory. The plane crossed deeper into <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> air space when it returned to <LOCATION> Ivalo </LOCATION> on Sunday, <PERSON> Seim </PERSON> said. He said the aircraft penetrated `` several miles'' over <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> territory, and may have violated Soviet airspace for 20 or 30 minutes. Norwegian government sources and the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> identified the pilot as <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>. No further information on him was immediately available. In <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Matti </PERSON> <PERSON> Autio </PERSON>, spokesman for the Finnish <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON> was questioned and released, and left <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> today, apparently for <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. Another Border Patrol official, reached by telephone at the northern base of <LOCATION> Rovaniemi </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON> claimed he lost his way due to bad weather. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed it was cloudy in the area during the weekend. A Soviet Embassy spokesman was quoted on Swedish radio as calling the incident `` a stupid practical joke'' rather than a provocation. `` No one wants to blow up this case,'' <PERSON> Seim </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Seim </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> contacted Soviet authorities on Sunday, and `` we have the impression that they followed the plane. They knew about it.'' The Aftenposten newspaper speculated that the Soviet may have refrained from shooting at the plane because of the superpower summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Seim </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> asked for a meeting with the Norwegians on Monday, when they handed over a formal protest. Asked if Saturday's flight was timed to the anniversary of Rust's flight, <PERSON> Seim </PERSON> said, `` We do n't know. But it seems likely, does n't it?'' Rust, also of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, flew a similar <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, on May 28, 1987, landing outside the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s walls He is serving a five-year prison term in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Rust was 19 at the time he made the flight. On Sept. 4, 1987, he was found guilty by a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> court of illegal entry into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, violating international flight regulations and malicious hooliganism. He was sentenced to four years in a labor camp, but is currently being held in a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> prison. Rust's flight embarrassed the Soviet air defenses, which failed to stop him, and prompted a shake-up in the Soviet military.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has has virtually erased the lead held by Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> state, a poll indicates. The poll, published in Monday's <ORGANIZATION> Salt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> shows <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a 3-point lead over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, well within the poll's 4.4 percent margin of potential sampling error. Two months ago, pollster <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardsley </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held a 21-point lead over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The Bardsley research organization asked 490 people by telephone whether they supported <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In all, 42 percent favored <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 39 percent favored <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and 19 percent were undecided. In late March, the survey showed that 55 percent favored <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 34 percent liked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and 11 percent were undecided. <PERSON> Bardsley </PERSON> said the main difference between the two polls is the switch of independent voters to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Independents favored <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by a 5-to-4 margin in March, but the latest poll shows independents support <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by a 5-to-3 ratio.

 A general strike today shut down a city at the center of a territorial and ethnic dispute between Armenians and Azeris in the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, sources said. A <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dissident, <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, said the strike has been under way for a week in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> in the disputed region of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. The strike closed factories and mass transit in the city today, with thousands of Armenians staying away from work, said a resident in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The resident declined to give his name. Also today, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> announced two officials in the region were dismissed from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for organizational and political mistakes that led to violence between Armenians and Azeris. Word of the strike in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> came after a new demonstration was held Monday in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>. In the <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> protest, 300,000 Armenians took to the streets to demand that <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, in the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, be put under Armenian jurisdiction, <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said. The majority of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s residents are Armenian. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, a half-Russian, half-Armenian journalist, said the protest in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> occurred outside the Opera Theater on a square where huge demonstrations took place earlier this year. Armenians began agitating in February for the right to annex Nagorno-Karabakh. At the end of that month, ethnic rioting broke out in the <LOCATION> Azeri </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> in which 32 people _ six <LOCATION> Azeris </LOCATION> and 26 Armenians _ were killed. Communist authorities rejected the demand to change jurisdiction over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, instead chosing a program of social and economic development. The ruling Politburo also replaced this month its party leaders in both republics. New party shakeups were announced today. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the former first secretary of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> regional party committee, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kevorkov </PERSON>, was dismissed from the party because of his `` serious political mistakes.'' `` His errors resulted in the loss of the party organization's vanguard role and in the heightening of inter-ethnic relations,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said in announcing the action taken by a plenary meeting of the Azerbaijani party organization `` He was found to be personally responsible for the disorders tht took place in the autonomous region.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the plenum also dismissed from the party D.M. <PERSON> Muslim-Zade </PERSON>, the former first secretary of the <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> city committee, for `` serious shortcomings in organizational and political work that brought about the tragic developments in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>.'' In another development, <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said police in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> had detained two friends of Paruyr Ayrikyan, an Armenian nationalist arrested in March. The two, <PERSON> Mofses </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorgisyan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nehak </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabrilyan </PERSON>, were accused of organizing a protest on Thursday, were held for 10 hours and fined the equivalent of $ 80, he said. The two are members of <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>'s nationalist group called the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Self-Determination </ORGANIZATION> On Saturday, about 50,000 Armenians in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> were said to have gathered to demand that authorities free <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>, 38, emerged as a primary spokesman for activists shortly after Armenians began demonstrating Feb. 13 for annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. He remains jailed, charged with spreading false information discrediting the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 The nation honored its war dead at thousands of ceremonies large and small on Memorial Day, including a crowd of 15,000 at the Vietnam Memorial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, while millions of Americans welcomed the beginning of the summer season. A holiday outing in <LOCATION> Tillatoba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, was hit by tragedy when a 16-foot boat carrying eight people capsized, killing six young women aboard the overloaded craft as well as a man who tried to rescue them, authorities said. The operator of the boat said the occupants were enjoying a slow `` joy ride,'' splashing water on each other, when the accident occurred Monday afternoon. A total of at least 340 people died on the nation's highways as of midnight Monday, according to a state-by-state count by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had estimated that the long weekend would claim 380 to 480 lives in traffic accidents. Last year, 416 people died, the Chicago-based council said. Although most of the country enjoyed sunny holiday weather, a snowstorm hit the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> on Sunday, dumping up to 10 inches of snow on southern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Up to 6 inches of snow fell in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, where rangers closed large sections of Yellowstone National Park. Strong winds battered the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast, and helicopters plucked 17 boaters from a beach on <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION> on Monday. On Sunday, the stormy seas apparently claimed two victims in separate boating accidents. Where the weather was good, people headed for the outdoors. In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, tourists packed motels and a state park along <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Traverse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on the state's <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> side. `` Last year we never did fill up,'' Traverse City State Park Manager <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said. `` This year, we were full on Saturday night.'' In <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, a fantasy weekend rock concert broadcast `` live'' by a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> station from an imaginary town called Livestock had as many as two dozen people calling state police asking how to get to the concert. `` It's like the ` War of the Worlds' all over again,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Frick </PERSON>, referring to the fictional 1938 radio broadcast by <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION>. The concert was `` just a way of having fun over Memorial Day weekend,'' said WGRX general manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkinson </PERSON>. `` Every famous group in the world was there. It was a nice escape for our listeners.'' Other memorial events around the nation included: _ A wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from the nation's capital, that drew 4,000 people. _ In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, a cannon on the 190-year-old USS Constitution was fired 21 times beginning at noon. _ In <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, retired Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON>, who commanded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and whose ancestors fought for the Confederacy, said the wounds of the Civil War have not yet healed. The three-day Battle of <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> and other Civil War confrontations played a crucial role in the evolution of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said. _ In <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, officials said the state's new <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans' Memorial, dedicated less than a month ago, attracted more weekend visitors than <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s Tomb. _ The <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family spent a quiet Memorial Day at their <LOCATION> Hyannis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, compound following a small memorial service Sunday for the 71st birthday of President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, said family spokesman <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. _ Solemnity was followed by Dixieland jazz at a cemetery in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, when a band and a crowd of 100 followed up a Memorial Day observance with a graveside salute to <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a bordello madam who left $ 1 million to charity when she died in 1911. _ In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Dore </PERSON> told a Memorial Day audience that paying tribute to the sacrifices of the past was not enough, and that the nation's `` prayers and best wishes'' were with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in his meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to reduce the chances of more war death. _ Holiday fun turned rowdy at the usually sedate resort town of <LOCATION> Chelan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and about 400 citations were issued and 150 arrests made, mostly for public intoxication and consumption of alcohol by minors

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, seeking to develop a platform for the general election contest, was consulting economic advisers today at his oceanside retreat here. Among those expected to meet with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON>, a former chairman of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>. The outspoken <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON>, now a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> economist, quit his post in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term after clashes with other <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides over his advocacy of a tax increase to help balance the federal budget. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, has vowed opposition to any tax increases. Money for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign is another issue under close scrutiny during his week in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Though he has been able to raise money quickly through the primary season, he has now nearly reached the primary spending limit of about $ 29 million _ including money for accounting costs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters on Tuesday that he might have to cut back on his travel plans the rest of the summer. That is one of the items his strategists are discussing this week. `` It's expensive to take this show on the road,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said to reporters Tuesday. The economists he was meeting with today also included <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, a professor of economics at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who is among <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s top economic advisers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has sought to closely identify himself with the record 65-month peacetime economic expansion, and one of his closest economic advisers is Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. A Baker protege, former deputy <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, now a consultant with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>., a Wall Street brokerage firm, will be among those visiting with the vice president today Also invited to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s summer home were <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahn </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Eickhoff </PERSON>, a private economist who was formerly the chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>.

However, he said he would not rule out a departure before the end of the summer. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> added that his <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has `` a remarkable record that will be an asset to any Republican running for office this fall.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave the keynote address on Monday at a Memorial Day parade here in the town square of <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, his vacation home. In that speech, in the rain, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised the efforts of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in reaching an arms limitation agreement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and said that if elected he would seek to reach additional agreements, including ones to eliminate chemical and biological warfare.

 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> played tour guide to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today, showing him the sights on cobblestoned Red Square near historic St. Basil's church with its famous onion domes. The superpower leaders strolled on the square, where hundreds of people were lined up to see <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s tomb, after they extended their meeting at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> by more than an hour. They chatted with groups of clapping tourists gathered in the square amid heavy security. When <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> mentioned peace and friendship, people said `` thank you, good'' in Russian. `` It was wonderful, I had never actually seen Red Square,'' the 77-year-old president said later. Like an American politician, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> picked up a toddler in a multicolored suit, and said to the little boy, `` Do you recognize the president?'' The child did not respond. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pointed out various features of Red Square which dates from the 15th century, joking there should be `` no perestroika.. no rebuilding here. When one woman mentioned peace, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said `` women are more active, but men want peace too.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also commented on the female sex. `` I was just saying to the general secretary how much I have great admiration for the women of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. They are courageous,'' he said. The two men seemed in a good humor. `` What we have decided to do is talk to each other rather than about each other and it's working just fine,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sometimes criticized each other's country, `` But I see that some of this is a misconception about each other.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to reinstate an affirmative action plan designed to increase the number of blacks in the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the plan _ calling for hiring at least six blacks for every 10 job openings _ unlawfully discriminates against whites. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here ruled last year that the hiring quota violates federal law and the Constitution. Relying on recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings, the appeals court said the plan is not narrowly tailored to remedy past discrimination. The appeals court noted, for example, that since 1981 about 75 percent of those hired as city firefighters are black. The appeals court said, `` We are entirely at a loss to discern any act of hiring discrimination, much less any pattern or practice of discrimination'' that the quota seeks to remedy. `` There were no present-day impediments to black hiring. There were no relics from yesteryear to overcome.'' The appeals court added: `` To be valid, race-conscious remedies must in fact be remedial in nature. They are not to promote the Utopian goal, as some might see it, of a society in strict proportional racial balance in every employment setting, from brain surgery to basketball.'' The appeals court overturned a federal judge's decree approving the plan. The plan had been challenged by white firefighters and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. City officials, in asking the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to reinstate the plan, said the appeals court ruling `` has crippled voluntary efforts by government employers to eliminate discriminatory barriers to employment and to cure the lingering effects of past unlawful discrimination.'' City officials said past discrimination was caused in part by a written test for firefighters used from 1969 to 1980 that was not related to the job and resulted in the hiring of whites for most openings. The city also said that the appeals court ruling has put the fire department in a bind, with some 100 firefighter vacancies now. City officials note that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in an appropriations bill for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, effectively has barred the fire department from hiring at random from among applicants. The city has hired a testing firm to develop an examination for hiring firefighters that would pass legal muster. But the exam is not expected to be completed until 1989. Also at stake in the case could be back pay and seniority for whites allegedly discriminated against by the affirmative action plan. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, urging the justices to reject the city's appeal, said the hiring quota is improper because there is no continuing segregation that must be addressed. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers, noting that some 38 percent of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> firefighters are black, said that `` compares very favorably to the 29 percent black population in the greater <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> metropolitan area'' that includes parts of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. City officials said the relevant figure is the 64 percent working-age black population within the borders of the nation's capital Approximately 70 percent of the city government's workforce is black The city's appeal was supported by state officials in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. Civil rights groups also urged the high court to reinstate the plan. They said the appeals court ruling, if adopted elsewhere, could have a devastating impact on voluntary efforts to fight racial discrimination. The case is <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-1150.

<HEAD>Justices Say Cable Systems Need Not Carry All Local Signals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to resurrect federal rules that would force cable television operators to carry all local TV signals on their systems. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that struck down as unconstitutional interim `` must-carry'' rules adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s in 1986. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here ruled last December that the rules, which were to be imposed for five years, violated free-speech rights. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION> and other broadcast organizations urged the justices to reinstate the rules, saying they fear cable operators may drop their over-the-air signals. The appeals court said the need for such rules `` is more speculative than real.'' Lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> agreed, and urged the justices to reject the broadcasters' appeals. The appeals court in 1985 said the commission's original set of rules unlawfully `` coerce speech'' because they required cable operators to carry local broadcasters' signals irrespective of whether the operator considered them appropriate programming. After the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused in 1986 to disturb that ruling, the commission issued the interim rules _ forcing cable system operators to carry local signals for five years. The rules entitled a television station to insist that its signal be retransmitted on any cable system serving the station's local service area Cable systems, especially those with fewer channels, have opposed the rules because they often were forced to run the same programming on a number of stations if stations they are required to carry broadcast programs from the same television network. For example, a cable system in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> might be forced to carry the signal of the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> affiliates in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, even though the programming is identical much of the time. In its December ruling, the appeals court said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s reimposition of must-carry rules on a five-year basis neither clearly furthers a substantial governmental interest nor is of brief enough duration to be considered narrowly tailored -LRB- in imposing -RRB- restrictions on speech. In one of the appeals acted on today, lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> contended that the appeals court ruling could affect what television programming is available to tens of millions of American families. `` The lower court has made the television choices that are available to these homes largely dependent on the economic and political predilections of the only cable operator to provide cable service in any given neighborhood,'' the appeal argued. But <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers representing the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> told the court that during the 16 months between the appeals court's invalidation of the original must-carry rules and imposition of the interim rules `` cable operators generally did not stop carrying local broadcast signals. They said the appeals court's ruling `` gives the commission an opportunity to observe how broadcasters and the cable industry will operate without must-carry rules.'' `` If experience, as opposed to prediction, proves that must-carry rules are needed to advance public interests, the commission may build a record supporting new must-carry rules and defend those rules in the courts,'' the government lawyers said. The cases are <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1487; <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> vs. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1506; <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> vs. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1510; and <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> vs. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1551.

<HEAD>Court Leaves $25 Million Fine Intact for Check-Kiting Fraud</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today left intact a $ 25 million fine against a businessman for what prosecutors called the biggest check-kiting fraud in the history of American banking. The court, citing the lack of a `` substantial federal question,'' rejected a challenge to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law that says those convicted in such schemes may be forced to pay fines equal to twice the amount gained through their criminal conduct. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Halloran </PERSON> was convicted of defrauding <LOCATION> Marine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> bank, of $ 23 million through a complex, synchronized drawing and depositing of some 15,000 checks. The evidence showed that <PERSON> Halloran </PERSON> had accounts at <LOCATION> Marine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>, and that he kept shifting funds from one to the other for a one-year period that began April 1, 1983. His admitted aim was to save his financial empire, including the Taft Hotel in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a Holiday Inn in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and several concrete companies. <PERSON> Halloran </PERSON> was sentenced to six months in jail and fined $ 25 million. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Madden </PERSON>, a co-defendant who was not involved in the appeal acted on today, was ordered to perform 120 hours of community service and was fined $ 100,000. <PERSON> Halloran </PERSON> said his fine is excessive and violates his constitutional rights. He denied that he made anything like a $ 25 million profit from the check-kiting scheme. But state Judge <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkman </PERSON>, in upholding the fine, said prosecutors demonstrated that the fraud enabled <PERSON> Halloran </PERSON> not only to save his empire without paying interest but also that his holdings substantially increased in value. <PERSON> Halloran </PERSON>'s `` gain'' from the fraud was said to be more than $ 22 million. Moreover, the judge said, `` At trial, to avoid a grand larceny conviction, the defendants were eager to show the health of <PERSON> Halloran </PERSON>'s financial empire.'' Afterward, the judge said, `` The empire became moribund: its gains limited to the amount pumped in from the kite; its losses oppressive and all but wiping out any capital gains.'' `` These self-serving arguments and conclusions at sentence did not rebut the people's evidence that defendants' gains went well beyond the monies taken in the course of the kite and returned to <LOCATION> Marine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> upon discovery of the fraud,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Halloran </PERSON> argued that he `` borrowed'' the money from the bank and intended to repay it. He repaid <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> some $ 23 million after a shortfall in that amount was discovered in his account at the bank. In urging the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to hear <PERSON> Halloran </PERSON>'s appeal, his lawyers said the case could have a bearing on government seizures of property and profits from illegal drug operations and other criminal enterprises covered by the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. `` Constitutional questions concerning the applicable standard of proof and the permissible limits of the term ` gain' are both important and recurring,'' they said. The lawyers said it is unconstitutional for a defendant to be ordered to pay a fine up to twice the amount of the alleged gain when proof of that gain is based only on `` a preponderance of the evidence'' _ the standard used in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law. Most often used in criminal cases is the more stringent `` beyond a reasonable doubt'' standard of proof. The case is <PERSON> Halloran </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 87-1595.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Award Won by California Firm Against Ohio Company</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let stand a $ 5 million punitive-damages award won by a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> savings and loan association against an Ohio-based insurance company. The justices, over two dissenting votes, refused to hear arguments that the award, believed to be the largest of its kind ever upheld in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> courts, is unconstitutionally excessive. Justices <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> voted to hear arguments in the case, but four votes are needed to grant such review. Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> did not participate in the case, for uannounced reasons. The high court earlier this month passed up deciding in a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> case whether the ban on `` excessive fines'' imposed by the Constitution's Eighth Amendment applies to non-criminal cases. No court ever has applied the constitutional principle to non-criminal cases. A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> jury awarded the <ORGANIZATION> Downey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> $ 123,769 in compensatory damages and $ 5 million in punitive damages after ruling that the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a wholly owned subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, had denied insurance benefits in bad faith. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> had been insured by <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> against any dishonest or fraudulent act by the savings and loan's employees. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> sought to collect on that insurance bond after one of its branch managers allegedly took part in a conspiracy to bilk <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> for hundreds of thousands of dollars. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> claimed the scheme was partially successful, and resulted in a lawsuit against the savings and loan by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In defending against that suit, <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> paid over $ 68,000 in legal fees and $ 55,000 in settlement costs. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> in 1977 sought reimbursement of those expenses from <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>. The jury in 1984 found that <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> acted in bad faith in denying <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>'s claim. The challenged $ 5 million award was upheld by a state appeals court, and the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to hear <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal last May 29. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> argued that the punitive damages award, and the way it was awarded, `` are the inevitable, yet unpredictible, products of a system fundamentally out of control in which fines are becoming larger and are imposed more frequently.'' Some state legislatures, reacting to soaring insurance rated, in recent years have imposed ceilings on how much money can be recovered in personal-injury lawsuits. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> has abolished the awarding of punitive damages _ those aimed at punishing wrongful conduct that harms others and deterring such conduct in the future. Some commentators have decried soaring damages awards, charging that such a trend spurs more lawsuits, some of them frivolous, and that it overcompensates injured people. But other commentators contend that awarding punitive damages in addition to compensatory damages serves a vital public interest in deterring wrongful conduct. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Downey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, 87-159.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> said today that four hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, three Americans and an Indian, may soon be freed following the Syrian army's takeover of the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> district where they are believed held. The paper identified the four as Americans <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Polhill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, and Indian <PERSON> Mithileshwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, all educators at <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. They were abducted Jan. 24, 1987. `` The Syrians appear set to produce four Western hostages from the suburbs of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> within a week of their military deployment there,'' the Times reported from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. It said the four `` are now believed to be in the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> movement, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s proxy militia in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and to be in the <LOCATION> Bourj </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Barajneh </LOCATION> district of the suburbs which is now under Syrian military control.'' The Times said Amal leader <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s justice minister, has scheduled a news conference this week, `` and there is understandable speculation that this may be to announce the hostages' release.'' The <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> As-Safir </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that the four educators might be freed soon. The newspaper, which cited unidentified sources close to President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, linked the possible release to the deployment of Syrian troops in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums Eighteen foreigners _ including nine Americans _ are believed held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Reduce Award Won from Tampon Manufacturer By

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to reduce a jury award of more than $ 11.2 million won from a tampon manufacturer by the family of a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> woman who died of toxic shock syndrome. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> seeking to reduce the award. <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> was sued by <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Gilvie </PERSON>, whose wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, died April 2, 1983. His lawsuit charged that Mrs. <PERSON> O'Gilvie </PERSON>, a mother of two children, died from toxic shock syndrome caused by her use of <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> super-absorbent tampons. The company's warning on its package that `` tampons are associated with toxic shock syndrome'' was inadequate, the suit said. A jury awarded actual damages of $ 1.5 million and punitive damages of $ 10 million. <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> was ordered to pay 80 percent of the actual damage award and all of the punitive damages. But a federal judge reduced the punitive-damages amount to $ 1.35 million on condition that <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> withdraw its super-absorbent tampon from the market. The 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> overturned the judge's ruling in June 1987 and restored the full $ 10 million award The appeals court said, `` The record reveals abundant evidence that <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> deliberately disregarded studies and medical reports linking high-absorbency tampon fibers with increased risk of toxic shock. There is evidence that <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> deliberately sought to profit ... by advertising the effectiveness of its high-absorbency tampons when it knew other manufacturers were reducing the absorbency of their products.'' The appeals court also said the judge lacked adequate grounds to reduce the punitive award. The reduction only would be proper if the judge found the award was `` so excessive that it shocks the judicial conscience,'' the appeals court said. It said by lessening the judgment in return for <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION>' agreement to withdraw the high-absorbency tampons, the judge `` rewarded the company for continuing its -LRB- injury-causing -RRB- conduct long enough to to use it as bargaining chip. Toxic shock, caused by bacteria in the vaginal tract, was first linked to tampon use in the mid-1980s by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> O'Gilvie </PERSON>, 87-1021.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in an extraordinary question-and-answer session with Soviet students, said today that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` would like nothing better'' than to help in the search for Soviet soldiers missing in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The session, covering topics as diverse as the plight of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> to the two-term restriction on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents and arms control, followed the president's speech at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He took questions from a stage beneath a towering bust of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and a banner emblazoned with a hammer and sickle. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> noted that there once had been hopes that he and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could mark the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit by signing a sweeping treaty to cut strategic nuclear weapons by half. `` There are many things still to be settled,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, all but confirming the treaty will not be signed this week. `` It is not completed, there are still points that are being debated,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who has only one more scheduled meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> before departing Thursday. `` We are both hopeful that it can be finished before I leave office'' in January, he said. `` If it is n't, I assure you that I will have impressed on my successor that we must carry on until it is signed.'' One student told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> th! t there are 310 Soviet soldiers missing in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after eight years of fighting. The student asked if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would assist in the search and return of the forces. `` Very much so,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied. `` We would like nothing better than that.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has vowed to continuing supporting the Afghan rebels as long as the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> supportsthe Kremlin-backed regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Another student told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that a delegation of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> had traveled here because they found it impossible to meet with him in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he did not know they had sought an audience, and that `` I'd be very happy to see them.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had given the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> millions of acres of land and established reservations where they could live if they chose. `` We've done everything we can to meet their demands as to how they want to live. Maybe we made a mistake. Maybe we should not have humored them'' and insisted that they become integrated in American life. As for the delegation here, he said, `` I don ` t know what their complaint might be. The question-and-answer session followed a speech in which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> preached free markets, freedom of speech and the American way of life. The appearance, at the university where <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> earned a degree in 1954, was one in a string of events undertaken by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to promote the concept of freedom and human rights. White House planners said the appearance gave <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> an opportunity to pass along some thoughts to a generation that one day will govern the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Progress is not fore-ordained,'' he said. `` The key is freedom _ freedom of thought, freedom of information, freedom of communication.'' He praised the economic progress of such free-market citadels as <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. And he added: `` Perhaps most exciting are the winds of change blowing over the People's <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where one-quarter of the world's population is now getting its first taste of economic freedom. As if that was not challenge enough to the world's other major communist state, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he hoped that Soviet families will soon be free to visit their relatives overseas. `` Recently, a few individuals and families have been allowed to visit relatives in the West. We can only hope that it wo n't be long before all are allowed to do so, and Ukrainian-Americans, Baltic-Americans, Armenian-Americans can freely visit their homelands just as this Irish-American visits his.'' Extolling the importance of a free enterprise system in which entrepreneurs may try and sometimes fail, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` it's so hard for government planners, no matter how sophisticated, to ever substitute for millions of individuals working night and day to make their dreams come true. `` The fact is, bureaucracies are a problem around the world.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` Americans make no secret of our belief in freedom,'' and exercise it by choosing a new president every four years and enjoying freedom of religion, speech and assembly and a judicial system where the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. `` Freedom is the right to question and change the established way of doing things,'' the president said. He said that in his talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, `` I have spoken of how important it is to institutionalize change _ to put guarantees on reform. `` And we have been talking together about one sad reminder of a divided world, the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` It is time to remove the barriers that keep people apart.'' He told the students they are living `` in one of the most exciting, hopeful times in Soviet history. It is a time when the first breath of freedom stirs the air and the heart beats to the accelerated rhythm of hope, when the accumulated spiritual energies of a long silence yearn to break free.'' He said, `` We do not know what will be the conclusion of this journey, but we are hopeful that the promise of reform will be fulfilled. `` In this <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> spring, this May 1988, we may be allowed that this hope _ that freedom, like the fresh green sapling planted over <ORGANIZATION> Tolstoy </ORGANIZATION>'s grave, will blossom forth at last in the rich fertile soil of your people and culture.'' At a meeting earlier today with writers, artists, film makers and others, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said freedom for the arts has been expanded in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in recent years. `` We hope to see it go further. We hope to see the works of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> published in the land he loves and we hope to see a permanent end to creative restrictions on all writers and artists. `` We want this not just for your sake but for our own,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` We believe the greater freeoms in other countries, the more secure our own freedoms and peace.'' He said both artists and political leaders had to be able to grasp a vision and to put it into life. `` By the way, I ` ve found that Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has the ability to grasp and hold a vision and I respect him for that,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the 38 intellectuals assembled in the House of Writer's elegant wood paneled restaurant. Praising what he called the recent thaw in the Soviet arts, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he hoped all constrictions on the arts would finally fall, and that artists like ballet dancer <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> and cellist and conductor <PERSON> Mstislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> would once again perform in their homeland. The president's speech drew a warm standing ovation. Afterwards, writer <PERSON> Fyodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> called it `` one of the best speeches of his life. `` He spoke very sincerely, he spoke about his private life, he mentioned all the names which are very dear to Russian intelligentisa,'' <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Zalygin </PERSON>, editor of Novy Mir, a literary journal which has published several previously banned works recently, was asked whether he thought <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>'s works would appear. `` Yes,'' he said, declining to forecast when and saying this depended on negotiations with <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> himself.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Award Won by San Diego Gas Station Against

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let stand a $ 3.5 million punitive-damages award won by a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> gas station operator against <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the award, believed to be the second largest of its kind ever upheld in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> courts, is unconstitutionally excessive. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> had operated an <ORGANIZATION> ARCO </ORGANIZATION> station as an independent dealer for 12 years before agreeing to convert his service station to a mini-market and self-service station in 1979. His lawsuit charged <ORGANIZATION> ARCO </ORGANIZATION> with fraudulently misrepresenting facts in connection with the conversion of his station. A state court jury awarded <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> $ 525,788 in compensatory damages _ $ 79,061 in out-of-pocket losses, $ 396,727 in lost anticipated profits and $ 50,000 for emotional distress. The jury also awarded him $ 3.5 million in punitive damages against <ORGANIZATION> ARCO </ORGANIZATION>. A state appeals court upheld the award except for the emotional-distress damages, and the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to hear <ORGANIZATION> ARCO </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> ARCO </ORGANIZATION> argued that the huge punitive-damages award _ seven times the compensatory-damages award _ violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on `` excessive fines.'' No court has ever applied that constitutional principle to non-criminal cases. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in May passed up deciding in a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> case whether the constitutional ban on `` excessive fines'' can be applied to personal-injury lawsuits. Some state legislatures, reacting to soaring insurance rates, in recent years have imposed ceilings on how much money can be recovered in personal-injury lawsuits. Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> ARCO </ORGANIZATION> urged the justices to `` send a clear signal that the state courts must stop these gargantuan awards.'' But lawyers for <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> argued that the <ORGANIZATION> ARCO </ORGANIZATION> appeal should not be granted because the oil company's lawyers had not raised the `` excessive fines'' argument in state courts. The justices refused to address the punitive-damages issue in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> case decided earlier this month after noting that it had not been raised in state courts. <ORGANIZATION> ARCO </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal did not challenge the $ 475,000 compensatory-damages award won by <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>. The case is <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Richfield </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>, 87-1196.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Aluminum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> failed today in its <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> bid to avoid having to pay part of a $ 275,000 award to an <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> woman hit in the eye by a twist-off cap from a 7-Up bottle. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that <ORGANIZATION> ALCOA </ORGANIZATION>, which makes the caps, was partly at fault in the accident. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliman </PERSON> of <PERSON> Gooding </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, lost the sight in her left eye when the cap shot off the bottle Oct. 9, 1979. Mrs. <PERSON> Sliman </PERSON> was using a pair of needle-nose pliers to try to remove the `` pilfer-proof'' band that secures the cap to the bottle. A jury found that Mrs. <PERSON> Sliman </PERSON> was partly at fault. But it also determined that <ORGANIZATION> ALCOA </ORGANIZATION> knew the use of tools to remove the cap could cause it to blow off, and should have done more to warn consumers of the hazard. Mrs. <PERSON> Sliman </PERSON> was awarded $ 130,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION> and $ 145,000 from 7-Up. The <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last November ruled there was substantial evidence that `` ALCOA not only foresaw but had actual knowledge of consumers' using tools to remove caps. The jury readily could have found that <ORGANIZATION> ALCOA </ORGANIZATION> could have foreseen <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliman </PERSON>'s actions.'' <ORGANIZATION> ALCOA </ORGANIZATION> should have done more to assure that 7-Up warned its customers of the danger, the state court said. In the appeal acted on today, <ORGANIZATION> ALCOA </ORGANIZATION> said Mrs. <PERSON> Sliman </PERSON> would not have been injured `` if she had simply twisted the cap off the bottle as approximately 83 million other aluminum caps had been removed prior to her injury.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said there also were consumer claims that caps had blown off such bottles 229 times in the past and that <ORGANIZATION> ALCOA </ORGANIZATION> was aware of the claims. The case is <ORGANIZATION> ALCOA </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Sliman </PERSON>, 86-1569.

<HEAD>Court Says New York Can Force Some Judges to Retire at Age 70</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s policy of forcing elected judges to retire at age 70 even though no such mandatory retirement is imposed on appointed judges was left intact by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today. The justices, four of whom are over 70, threw out an appeal by eight current or former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> judges who say the retirement policy violates the Constitution's equal-protection guarantees. The court cited the lack of a `` substantial federal question'' in dismissing the appeal. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> policy, reflected in the state's constitution and a state law, was upheld by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last Sept. 3. The state's highest court ruled that the differing treatment of elected and appointed judges is valid. The state policy previously had applied to state and local judges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, whether elected or appointed. A challenge to it was rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. But the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which originally protected only people between 45 and 70 and does not apply to elected officials, was amended in 1987 to bar employment discrimination against people over 70. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s policy subsequently was changed to exempt appointed judges, sparking the equal-protection challenge. `` That the state policy requiring retirement of judges is partially frustrated because the federal statute preempts it with respect to appointed judges does not render the policy irrational, and the state is free to pursue that policy to the extent doing so is consistent with federal law,'' the state court ruled. The state court used the least stringent standard of review for equal-protection challenges, in which courts decide whether a law or governmental policy that allows differing treatment is rational. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the five state judges argued that differing treatment based on age should spark the same stringent standard of review in courts as does differing treatment based on race. The state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> rejected that argument. The eight judges who challenged the state policy are: Benjamin Glass, an elected state trial judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> forced to retire in 1981; <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, elected <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges; <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON>, elected state <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges in <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Counties </LOCATION>, respectively, who turned 70 last year; <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>, an elected <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Civil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> judge who is 65; and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> and <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buswell </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, whose judicial positions were not listed in submitted court documents. Federal judges, including <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices, are appointed for life.

 States sometimes may execute convicted murderers even if their constitutional right to a lawyer's help was violated, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. By a 5-3 vote, the justices said for the first time that such errors may be deemed `` harmless.'' But the justices voted 8-0 in stating that such an error in the prosecution of convicted <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> murderer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Satterwhite </PERSON> was not harmless. The decision overturned his death sentence. The high court in 1981 ruled that a defendant facing a possible death sentence if convicted has the right to consult with a lawyer before submitting to a psychiatric examination designed to determine his future dangerousness. Writing for the court today, Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said violations of that right do not necessarily mean that an ensuing death sentence, in part based on a finding of future dangerousness, must be thrown out. The court refused to adopt an automatic rule that would call for reversing the death sentence in any case in which such a violation occurs. a We believe that a reviewing court can make an intelligent judgment about whether the erroneous admission of psychiatric testimony might have affected a capital sentencing jury,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. The ruling thus leaves to a case-by-case review the fates of other death row inmates whose right to consult with a lawyer before taking such tests were violated. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was joined by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>. Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> favored imposing an automatic rule to strike down any death sentence in a case in which such a constitutional violation occurred. `` The unique nature of a capital sentencing determination should cause this court to be especially hesitant ever to sanction harmless-error review of constitutional errors that taint capital sentencing proceedings,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> wrote for himself and <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. He said an error such as the one in <PERSON> Satterwhite </PERSON>'s case should not be subject to a harmless-error review. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did not participate in the case. <PERSON> Satterwhite </PERSON> was convicted of the March 12, 1979, murder of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a convenience store clerk in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>.

 Police used an undercover agent posing as a prospective buyer today to recover three 19th-century masterpieces, including works by <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON>. All three paintings taken from <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Municipal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> last month were recovered undamaged, according to police spokesman <PERSON> Klaas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilting </PERSON>. The paintings, valued at up to $ 52 million, were seized when police raided a hotel and arrested a 36-year-old man who was selling them for $ 1.14 million, Wilting said. The money was confiscated during the raid at the Pullman Hotel, he said. The paintings are <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s 1888 `` Carnations,'' the 1894 still life `` Bottle with Apples'' by <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON>, and a work by Dutch painter <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jongkind </PERSON>, `` The House of <PERSON> Maitre </PERSON> <PERSON> Billaud </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Nevers </LOCATION>,'' done in 1874. In their pre-dawn raid, police found the <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> inside the hotel and the two other paintings in a car parked outside, Wilting said. The artworks were wrapped in blankets, Wilting said. Another police spokesman, <PERSON> Joost </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijngaarden </PERSON>, said an undercover police officer had posed as a buyer in the deal, but he refused to give details. Two other people, thought to be genuine prospective buyers, also were arrested, police said earlier. All suspects were being held pending charges. None were identified, in line with Dutch police practice. Police refused to say whether the undercover police officer was posing as a partner of the other two prospective buyers, or whether police had a role in raising the substantial amount of cash. There was no immediate word whether the alleged seller, who has a police burglary record, was involved in the May 20 break-in and theft at the Municipal Museum. In that incident, a ground-floor window was smashed to gain access to the museum. Last week, police received anonymous tips that buyers for the paintings were being solicited abroad, Wilting said. `` We got hard evidence of that early this week and that's when we decided to act,'' said Wilting. Museum director <PERSON> Wim </PERSON> <PERSON> Beeren </PERSON> said when the paintings were stolen that they are so famous it would be almost impossible to sell them on the open market. He speculated they were stolen on commission by a private collector. The three works were only insured for fire damage, but <PERSON> Beeren </PERSON> said at the time the huge loss estimate was due in part to the record prices paid for recently auctioned <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Goghs </PERSON>. Last November, a collector paid $ 53 million for <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Irises'' at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> auction and eight months earlier, the artist's `` Sunflowers'' was auctioned in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for $ 29.8 million However, experts at the <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auction firm in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said soon after the <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> burglary that the three paintings together were worth just $ 11 million, with <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s estimated at about $ 2 million. Experts at the <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> museum put the value of the three at up to $ 52 million. The smashed window in the May burglary at the Municipal Museum triggered an electronic alarm at the museum's private security firm, which reportedly took 20 minutes to warn police and investigate the burglary. The museum holds about 3,200 mainly 19th and 20th-century artworks, but has had no night guard since 1975, when round-the-clock surveillance was abolished as an economy measure.

 <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> pleaded guilty today to charges it lied about the amount of a hazardous chemical it used at its plant in <LOCATION> Woburn </LOCATION>, where residents have blamed pollution of drinking water for six cancer deaths. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauro </PERSON> fined the New York-based chemical company the maximum $ 10,000 for understating the amount of acetone bought by its Cryovac division in <LOCATION> Woburn </LOCATION>. The judge, as part of an agreement between <LOCATION> W.R. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grace </LOCATION> and federal prosecutors, dismissed a second charge against the company that it had concealed the fact that waste materials had on numerous occassions been dumped behind the plant. In a separate civil suit filed by eight <LOCATION> Woburn </LOCATION> familes, <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> was found liable for polluting town wells. The case was settled in 1986 for a reported $ 8 million. In Februrary 1982, the company asserted in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> that it had bought only one five-gallon pail of acetone in 1978 for the <LOCATION> Woburn </LOCATION> plant. The company said that acetone purchase was the only one it made for the <LOCATION> Woburn </LOCATION> plant in 22 years covered by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> inquiry. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> told <PERSON> Tauro </PERSON> that from 1973 to 1976, <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> had bought 65 gallons of acetone and had used the solvent repeatedly in the 1960s and 1970s to clean paint spray guns and circuit boards at Cryovac, a food packaging machine shop. <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Popeo </PERSON> told the judge that no company officials were aware of that the reports to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> were inaccurate at the time they were filed. `` No one suspected ... they committed any act that would have been hazardous,'' <PERSON> Popeo </PERSON> said. W.R. Grace was charged by a federal grand jury in January 1987 with lying to the government about chemicals it used at the Cryovac plant located near two contaminated <LOCATION> Woburn </LOCATION> wells. The two-count indictment charged that in 1982 Grace knowingly and falsely reported to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> amounts of toxic chemicals bought and used at Cryovac. The indictment also charged that <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> concealed the dumping outside the plant from the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>.

 The nation's legislators are having their usual headaches over budgets and taxes, but they've also found time this year to debate the merits of key lime pie in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, banana slugs in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and gold in them thar <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. It's all part of the perennial mania for naming official state symbols for just about everything under the sun, from state song to state insect. Supporters say the custom can boost tourism, get young people involved in the political process and provide harmless comic relief for lawmakers. Opponents say it wastes time and money and makes legislators look foolish. `` It gets so tense in there sometimes. It's just too much,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderlinde </PERSON> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, where this year's <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> designated the triceratops, a plant-eating dinosaur, as the official fossil and <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> gold as the official jewelry `` This livens it up, and then people will relax and get back to work.'' <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> gold was honored for its economic importance to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. About 2,000 people work in the state's mining industry and 500 more are employed in making jewelry from the gold. Minutes after the gold measure was passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in January, lawmakers adopted a second, tongue-in-cheek resolution naming Vanderlinde the state's official jewel because she takes gold shots for arthritis. `` Everybody's human, they enjoy a little touch of lightheartedness like anyone else,'' said <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>, an editor who helps keep track of official state symbols for the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governments </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION> `` Sometimes it becomes a tool for schoolkids to become involved in state government and lobby the legislature,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> said. `` It can also be a recognition of certain things that are indigenous to the state.'' The latter was the case in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> voted last year to designate the quahog, the Narragansett Indian name for clam, as the state shellfish. The idea was pushed by a junior high school shell club. `` We are a tourist state ... and we are an ocean state and if for no other reason, we should recognize our fishing industry,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jennie </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, the bill's sponsor. `` It's quite serious. It was n't done in jest.'' She said the quahog is beginning to appear on tourist information and billboards. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted last month to name the key lime pie the official state pie, inspired by a legislative report that recommended the honor as `` an excellent way to promote a genuine <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> product, since the pie can only be properly made with key limes from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.'' The measure has stalled in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where Rules Chairman <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> favors sweet potato pie more common to the Panhandle. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> named the monarch butterfly the state insect in response to a campaign by a group of schoolchildren. `` People think it's crazy, but you've got to encourage these kids,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON>. `` This year, one kid got all dressed up as a monarch butterfly. They were all excited.'' The House proved less sympathetic, failing even to consider the measure. On Thursday, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> nearly squashed a proposal to name the banana slug the state's official mollusk. Sen. <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> had to settle for a chance to have the proposal reconsidered in the future. `` These things are repulsive, I mean look at them ... The joke has to stop here,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON>, as banana slugs oozed around inside a glass terrarium on a cart parked on the floor of the upper house in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. No such shenanigans were allowed this year in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mannweiler </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President Pro Tem <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garton </PERSON> specifically warned lawmakers not to introduce frivolous bills for the biennial short session. `` It creates the wrong image for the Legislature,'' said <PERSON> Garton </PERSON>. `` It's a frivolous image. It creates the image that that's all we do, and it detracts from the serious business.'' But Mrs. <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> defended the practice of designating symbols. `` It's not something that takes up a great deal of attention or time,'' she said. `` I do n't think anybody expects every minute to be taken up with something serious. Maybe it's more harmless than raising taxes.''

<HEAD>Mrs. Reagan Vows to Write Book Giving Her Side of Astrology Flap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LENINGRAD, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today she might write a book giving her version of star-gazing in the White House, and that her account will `` absolutely'' interest former chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>. During a flight from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to tour this northern Soviet city, the first lady was questioned for the first time about the flap over <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s recently published memoir, `` For the Record.'' In the book, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> disclosed that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> consulted an astrologer for help in timing the events on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s schedule The former chief of staff also portrayed the president as an incurious, passive chief executive controlled by a manipulative wife and media-conscious staff. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> also made clear his bitterness at being ousted from the White House staff at the height of the Iran-Contra affair. He contended he was the victim of a cabal created and controlled by the first lady. At first, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> refused Tuesday to let reporters draw her into discussing any of <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s allegations. `` Everything has been said about that that needs to be said,'' she said. Asked if the `` stars were wrong'' for providing an answer, and she gave her questioner a sharp, disgusted look. But when asked if she intended to write her own book about the matter, she replied, `` Could be,'' and laughed heartily. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> borrowed a line from a <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> song to indicate she was intent on telling her side of the story. `` My way,'' she said, pointing at herself and repeating sternly, `` My way.'' <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> be interested in what she has to say? she was asked. She laughed and replied, `` Absolutely.''

<DATELINE>PUEBLO, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Pershing II rocket motor was fired successfully at dawn today, sending a plume of exhaust across the plains in a pollution test designed to help determine whether the site can be used to demolish the missiles as required by a new U.S.-Soviet treaty. Originally scheduled for May 20, the test burn had been delayed again and again because of bad weather. Today was the last day open for the test under the U.S.-Soviet Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty. The 56-second test started at 6:35 a.m. at <ORGANIZATION> Pueblo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Activity </ORGANIZATION> 15 miles east of here, officials said. `` There was a steady, bright white light from the end of the rocket nozzle extending approximately 75-80 feet,'' said depot spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. A brownish plume stretched out horizontally before the wind swept it across sagebrush-covered plains and about 50 monitors set out by the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, which will analyze the exhaust to see if such firings would pose any threat to the environment. `` The firing was conducted successfully. We expect the test itself will be a success from our initial indications,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. The intermediate nuclear weapons treaty was ratified last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and copies are scheduled to be exchanged Wednesday at the summit meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> between Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The treaty requires that the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 420 Pershing missiles be destroyed, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> plans to destroy the missiles by firing their rocket motors, which can not be reused. If the test had not been done today, it would have had to be delayed by at least 30 days because it would have been governed by the treaty. `` If we were to test fire it, it is then treated as an elimination -LRB- of a weapon -RRB- under the treaty and subject to inspection by the Soviet inspectors,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. `` They'd have to witness it. ... We have to give them 30 days' notice for an elimination inspection.'' <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckham </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, said it would be several weeks before a complete assessment of the test firing data will be complete. The Health Department is requiring the test before the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> can designate the depot for the $ 9 million program. `` We did n't believe that the composition of the propellant would present any significant environmental problem. We did have some concern for some of the pollutants and the net result from the test fire,'' <PERSON> Beckham </PERSON> said. Hydrogen chloride, which in extremely high levels can be an irritant, is one of the pollutants the division will be studying, <PERSON> Beckham </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Beckham </PERSON> noted that a similar test burn was conducted in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> in March. Because the Army stores and maintains <PERSON> Pershings </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>, the installation is the preferred site for demolishing them, but three other installations also are being considered, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said.

 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today it may be `` time to bang our fists on the table'' to prod negotiators working on a treaty halving strategic nuclear arms stockpiles. But it was clear that an agreement would not come at this week's summit. `` I'll do anything that works,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Officials in both delegations said the goal was to reach an agreement before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office next January. <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said that `` unfortunately, there will be no more signings'' beyond minor agreements finalized today. On their third day of talks, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met in the Soviet leader's <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> office, sitting beneath a portrait of <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>. After their discussions, they took an unscheduled stroll on Red Square past the tomb of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and shook hands with surprised tourists. `` Wonderful,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said of the square. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appeared tired and had difficulty following questions from reporters. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had slept poorly and that everyone in the delegation was tired, despite a four-day rest stop in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asked about her husband, said, `` He sleeps fine.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was in good health and `` his stamina is just fine.'' At a meeting with Soviet students, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked about his impression about Soviet dissidents and refuseniks with whom he met. Soviet newspapers described one of the dissidents as a collaborator with the Fascists during World War II. The president said he knew nothing about this allegation. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` has been most helpful and agreeable about correcting'' the problems incurred by those groups. `` We have the same type of thing happen in our country,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, blaming it on bureaucrats. The Soviet leader expressed new hopes for completing a major arms treaty, but it was not clear whether he was talking about getting it done by summit's end _ or merely before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ` s term concludes next January. Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials have said repeatedly they do not expect a strategic arms pact -LRB- START -RRB- to be concluded here. During an encounter with reporters, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked if he still believed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was an `` evil empire,'' as he has called it in the past. Standing next to his host, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he no longer thought that way. `` I was talking about another time, another era,'' the president said. The leaders also watched and joined in the applause as Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> signed several secondary agreements, including a pair of arms accords. Under one such pact agreed to in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the superpowers will notify each other of the time, place and intended target of intercontinental-range missiles tests. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, continuing his public relations offensive to promote freedom and human rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, met over lunch at the House of Writers with artists, filmmakers and writers. Talking to some of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s leading intellectuals, he discussed how an actor could become president _ explaining that both artists and political leaders had to be able to grasp a vision and to put it into life. `` By the way, I ` ve found that Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has the ability to grasp and hold a vision and I respect him for that,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said.

 Later, in an address prepared for delivery to students at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the young people were living `` in one of the most exciting, hopeful times in Soviet history'' when `` the first breath of freedom stirs the air.'' He said `` we are hopeful that the promise of reform will be fulfilled.'' The president cautioned that `` progress is not fore-ordained. The key is freedom _ freedom of thought, freedom of information, freedom of communication.'' He cited steps in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, adding that the most exciting changes were in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` where one quarter of the world ` s population is now getting its first taste of economic freedom.''

 At the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> meeting, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appeared to dig in his heels on his <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> missile defense plan, one of the key obstacles to agreement on a strategic arms treaty. `` It's never been a part of the negotiations,'' he said in response to a question. Without addressing Star Wars, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he was confident there would be progress on arms issues. `` And I'm sure that if the president makes good use of his time that we have remaining, I'm sure that we will be able to prepare the treaty,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. At that point, a reporter asked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> if he, too, thought a treaty could be concluded. `` Yes, I'm very pleased to hear what they're saying.'' Asked again if a treaty was possible, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> stepped in to answer, saying, `` If that question is to me, yes I think a START treaty is possible.'' The Soviet leader recalled that he and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, at their first summit in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1985, had reached an impasse at one point. He said that at that point, `` the president said, ` Well, let's stamp our fists on the table.' ` I said all right,' and by morning everything was agreed, the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> negotiations were successfully completed.'' `` Maybe now it is again a time to bang our fists on the table once again,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. Asked by a reporter if he agreed, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I'll do anything that works.''

 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, welcomed to the `` Venice of the North'' by tens of thousands of waving and smiling people, marveled today at the city's art and architectural gems after paying homage to the 650,000 Russians who starved to death in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> placed a bouquet flowers at the Monument to the Heroic Defenders, located near the front line of World War II where the fiercest battles were fought. From there she traveled to the Hermitage, which houses one of the most fabulous art collections in the world. Paintings by <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON>, <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, <PERSON> Matisse </PERSON> and other great artists can be found in the collection, begun in 1764 by <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> the Great. `` Staggering, staggering, there's just too much to digest,'' the first lady exclaimed at the end of her five-hour tour of the city. Queried whether she had any more sympathy for communism after viewing the extravagent finery used by the imperial family before the revolution, she replied quickly, `` No.'' As she began her tour of the museum, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked about the reception the people of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> had given her. `` Was n't that wonderful,'' she said. `` I was waving, hoping they would know which car I was in.'' The outpouring of affection appeared to be spontaneous. Officials had not released the first lady's motorcade route, which traveled the length of several of the city's renowned boulevards. At some points, people lined up several deep on the broad sidewalks to catch a glimpse of the petite first lady. En route to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters aboard her plane that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people `` are very warm and very open'' but that she was less impressed with her high-level contacts. `` Their philosophies and positions are completely different from ours,'' she said. Asked about her hand-holding with <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, with a shrug of her shoulders, `` I do n't know. It just sort of happened,'' indicating that it was an action that she had n't initiated. <PERSON> Lidiya </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromkyo </PERSON>, the wife of Soviet President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, accompanied Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the trip. The first lady said she found Mrs. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> `` very nice, very friendly, very warm.'' But asked if she had the same reaction to her tours with Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> smiled, and sat silent for a full 12 seconds pondering her answer. `` Well, she's a ... everybody's different,'' she finally said, evoking laughter from the reporters. She joined in. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will get back together on Wednesday to view icons in the famous Tretyakhov Gallery in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The trip to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> provided reporters with their first chance to question Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> about the report by former Chief of Staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> that astrology influenced the president's schedule. But she refused to be drawn into any discussion of the matter, declaring, `` Everything has been said about that that needs to be said.'' But she also promised to tell her own side of the story, saying <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> will `` absolutely'' be interested in the contents of the book she intends to write. The first lady started her campaign to visit <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> _ and particularly the priceless collection of art in the 400 rooms of the <ORGANIZATION> Hermitage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> _ last December when she mentioned her interest to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at a White House state dinner. <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> was constructed on the northern marshland of the <LOCATION> Neva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> the Great in the early 1700s, and has become a jewel of Russian historical and cultural treasures. But the city is also a monument to the strength of the Soviet spirit. The city was first named <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> and then <LOCATION> Petrograd </LOCATION>, and it was the capital of the Russian Empire from 1703 to 1918. It was in the forefront of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, and its citizens heroically withstood a siege by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> forces for 900 days during World War II. More than 650,000 people died of starvation during the blockade and more than 17,000 were killed in air raids and artillery shelling. Traditionally, newlyweds place flowers at the 150-foot high Monument to the Heroic Defenders, composed of an obelisk and sculptures with figures such as a mother mourning a dead child. The Hermitage's main building, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>'s Winter Palace, is itself a work of art. The baroque architecture was done by <PERSON> Bartolomeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rastrelli </PERSON>, an Italian who designed several other <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> landmarks. In all, the complex has 1,050 rooms, 117 staircases, 1,886 doors and 1,945 windows, and many a visitor has become exhausted trying to see the 65,000 works occupying 400 rooms in the museum. Even though guides advise spreading a tour over several days, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had less than an hour to spend at the palace. It proved to be a focal point of the revolution when the troops of Czar <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> fired on peaceful demonstrators, killing as many as 30 people in what came to be known as `` Bloody Sunday.'' The Winter Palace was a residence of the Imperial Family until the provisional government occupied it in 1917. The final item on Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> agenda was a trip by hydrofoil to <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> the Great's summer palace, built by the czar as a monument to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>'s victories over the Swedes in his struggle to find an outlet to the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The interiors of the palace are a collection of sumptuous and ornately furnished reception areas, but the highlight is the collection of cascading fountains, canals and gardens.

 Witnesses watched from the windows of a popular restaurant as an ultra-light plane crashed and burned, killing its pilot, a sheriff's investigator said today. The pilot had waved to restaurant patrons and was attempting to regain altitude `` when his left wing folded, the plane started spiraling and crashed'' several feet from the restaurant's parking lot Monday night, said Sheriff's Department investigator <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blankestyn </PERSON>, a 34-year-old auto mechanic from <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION>, was the pilot, <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> said. `` At this time we do n't know if it was pilot error or structural failure,'' <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> said.

The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's department were investigating, <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> said.

 During a question-and-answer session with students at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` there are many things still to be settled.'' `` We are hopeful that it can be finished before I leave office,'' he said, `` but I assure you, if it is n't, ... I will have impressed upon my successor that we must carry on until it is signed.'' In addition to their walk through Red Square, the leaders also strolled through the Kremlin ` s Cathedral Square, winning applause from several dozen onlookers. Like any politician, they waved to the crowds. Moving along with the leaders was a remarkable swarm of security agents. The square had been cleared of people except for hundreds standing in a single file to view <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s tomb and eight groups of about 25 each stationed in the area of St. Basil's Cathedral. The surprise visit to Red Square threw the official summit schedule out of whack. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told one cluster of people that, `` What we have decided to do is talk to each other rather than about each other and it's working just fine.'' Playing the part of tour guide, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pointed out landmarks in the historic square and joked, `` There be no perestroika.. no rebuilding here. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> approached each of the groups, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> introduced the president at each stop. The crowds applauded warmly. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told one group, `` When we meet, the president and I talk and he sometimes has criticisms about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. I do the same about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But I see that some of this is a misconception about each other.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also signed an agreement providing for joint tests this summer in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and at <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet devices to measure the force of blasts. Another agreement, extending for three years and expanding U.S.-Soviet cultural exchanges, was signed by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, and by Soviet Culture Minister <PERSON> Vasuky </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamharov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told reporters at a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> signing ceremony that his morning one-on-one meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> dwelled on economic questions. `` I criticized the position of the president and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> which has put very many roadblocks on the path of development of healthy economic cooperation,'' the Soviet leader said. `` The president considers that we need to move more actively to improve this.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> broke away from the presidential party and flew to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, where she viewed the treasures of the Hermitage Museum, housing 65,000 pieces of art, and visited the summer palace of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Great </PERSON>, scene of revolutionary Soviet history. Halfway through their four-day meeting, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> seemed at ease with each other. They chatted and laughed together Monday night at a state dinner in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s frescoed and icon-covered Hall of Facets despite lingering differences on human rights, arms control and other issues. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> they should conduct their business `` without interfering in domestic affairs, without sermonizing or imposing one's views and ways, without turning family or personal problems into a pretext for confrontation between states.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said they should continue searching for common ground. Underscoring his lobbying campaign, he gave <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a videotaped cassette of an old <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> movie entitled `` Friendly Persuasion,'' depicting a story set in the Civil War era. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could be excused for dividing his attention between the summit and a domestic sensation _ an unprecedented instance of a fallen Soviet leader publicly criticizing those who ousted him. Former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Communist Party chief <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> used a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> interview to accuse the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 2 official, <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, of blocking Soviet political reforms. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> had been an outspoken supporter of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. In the interview, he said he was hurt by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s refusal to support him after he criticized <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> at a 1987 meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Meantime, the American contingent here was growing. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> boarded an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to fly here to attend a ceremony at which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will exchange the documents of ratification of the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty. The treaty was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last Friday and the Soviet Presidium the following day. In the absence of agreement on a new, major arms treaty on strategic nuclear weapons, the already-ratified accord will serve as the crowning element of the summit windup on Wednesday. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> bids <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> farewell on Thursday and flies to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. On Friday, he returns home. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said several cultural and bilateral agreements were ready for signing today. The two sides have been working on a three-year extension of the educational and cultural exchanges signed by the two leaders in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1985. They also were expected to sign agreements on fisheries, cooperating on search and rescue operations at sea and the exchange of transportation technologies. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had discussed on Monday _ but found no agreement on _ <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plans for a `` Star Wars'' space-based anti-missile defense, the biggest obstacle to a START agreement to cut superpower nuclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent. Soviet spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> reported there was progress in two of the most biggest obstacles to a treaty, involving mobile missiles and cruise missiles fired from warplanes. However, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, while reporting progress, was not as upbeat. The official, who refused to be identified, said there still were problems in agreeing on how to count the air-launched cruise missiles. As for land-based mobile missiles, the official said, `` we haven ` t heard a verification scheme we think will work. ... I would not expect closure'' on the problem. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in his Kremlin dinner toast, said: `` Our main task continues to be the working out of an agreement on 50 percent reductions in strategic offensive arms while observing the ABM Treaty,'' the landmark 1972 agreement between the superpowers limiting missile-defense systems. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his answering speech, said: `` I intend to pursue the search for common ground during the months left to me as President. When I pass the job on to my successor, I intend to tell him it is a search that must be continued.''

<HEAD>Court Strikes Down Way Ohio Promotes Tax Credits the Use of
Gasohol</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today unanimously struck down the way <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> promotes through tax credits the use of `` gasohol,'' a motor vehicle fuel less environmentally troublesome than gasoline. The court ruled that the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> tax-credit scheme, challenged by a gasohol producer in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, interferes unconstitutionally with interstate commerce. Gasohol is the common name for a blend of 90 percent gasoline and 10 percent ethanol, a 199-proof alcohol derived from corn and other sources. Use of gasohol reduces the toxic emissions from leaded motor vehicle fuels. To advance environmental goals, most states and the federal government have offered tax credits for the production and sale of gasohol. Prior to 1985, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> offered reductions in its fuel taxes for fuels containing ethanol, regardless or where the ethanol was produced. But since 1985, the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> has extended the credit to gasohol containing ethanol produced out of state only if it comes from a state in which Ohio-produced ethanol receives a tax credit. The credit for gasohol amounts to about 25 cents per gallon. The reciprocity feature of the state law was challenged by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, which produces gasohol at its South Bend, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, plant and in 1985 was shipping about 25 percent of its output to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> distributors. New Energy said it was priced out of the market in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> when it lost its tax incentives. The <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> struck down the tax-credit law as unconstitutional by a 4-3 vote in late 1986. But shortly thereafter two of the justices in the court's majority were voted out of office. In 1986, the newly constituted state court granted a rehearing, and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s tax credit for ethanol was upheld. Today, the nation's highest court said the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was wrong. <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> said the law `` imposes an economic disadvantage upon out-of-state sellers, and the promise to remove that if reciprocity is accepted no more justifies disparity of treatment than it would justify categorical exclusion.'' The case is <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Limbach </PERSON>, 87-654.

Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today unanimously overturned the murder conviction and death sentence of a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> man accused of a 1977 killing in <LOCATION> Putnam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The justices ruled that <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Amadeo </PERSON> should have been allowed to raise the issue of discriminatory jury selection in a federal court appeal. The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> had ruled that <PERSON> Amadeo </PERSON> was not entitled to raise that issue because his lawyers failed to comply with a state procedural rule requiring such objections to be raised before trial. The appeals court rejected a federal judge's finding that <PERSON> Amadeo </PERSON>'s lawyers could not be expected to have learned about the discrimination against women and blacks in the selection of <LOCATION> Putnam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand juries and juries before <PERSON> Amadeo </PERSON>'s trial began. In a separate case, <LOCATION> Putnam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials were found to have structured the jury-selection process in a way in which blacks and women were under-represented. Writing for the high court today, Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said the appeals court should not have rejected the judge's finding unless convinced it was `` clearly erroneous.'' `` Because there is sufficient evidence in the record considered in its entirety to support the district court's factual findings, the court of appeals should not have set them aside,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. `` The district court's conclusion that -LRB- <PERSON> Amadeo </PERSON>'s -RRB- lawyers did not deliberately bypass the jury challenge was supported by events contemporaneous with the jury-selection process,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Amadeo </PERSON> had been convicted in the Sept. 29, 1977, killing of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> Sr. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Amadeo </PERSON> was one of three men involved in the crime, each of whom was a Marine absent without leave from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> LeJeune </LOCATION>. Today's decision means <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> officials must give <PERSON> Amadeo </PERSON> a new trial or set him free. The case is <PERSON> Amadeo </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, 87-5277.

<HEAD>Court Will Settle Case Between Delaware and New York</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to settle a multi-million dollar dispute between <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> over unclaimed dividend and interest payments on securities. The justices granted <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s request that it be allowed to sue <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> without the case first having been heard in some lower court. The court has such `` original'' authority in disputes between states. The conflict stems from the fact that 15 of the nation's largest stock brokerage firms are incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> but based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Each year, the firms recover substantial amounts of money in dividend and interest payments for people who can not be located. All states have so-called `` escheat'' laws providing that such abandoned money goes into the state treasury after remaining unclaimed for a certain time. In <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, the waiting period is seven years. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it is three years. <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s escheat law is binding on all corporations chartered in the state, but <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> considers brokerage firms with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading addresses subject to its escheat law and has pursued unclaimed payments. <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberly </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has been collecting such payments from Delaware-chartered brokerage firms since 1971. He said more than $ 50 million could be involved. <PERSON> Oberly </PERSON> told the justices, `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> should be directed to pay <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> amounts already paid to it to which <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> is or will be entitled under the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> escheat law and to cease interfering with <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s right to escheat the property of unknowns held by the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> brokerage corporations.'' But <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> urged the high court to reject <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s lawsuit. He said <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> has not yet exhausted all administrative remedies, and added that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is entitled to the dividend and interest overpayments held by brokerage firms with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading addresses. `` <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s failure for 17 years to employ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s claim procedure, in contrast to other states, or to attempt to negotiate with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before bringing this original action demonstrates that the case is not ripe for decision by this court,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> argued. The case is <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 111 Original.

<HEAD>Court Gives Federal Regulators Power to Oust Bank Executives</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today gave federal regulators broad power to oust bank executives from their jobs temporarily when the executives are accused of serious crimes. In a 9-0 ruling, the court said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> acted properly in suspending an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> bank president. The justices upheld a law permitting the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> to suspend a bank executive accused of serious wrongdoing for up to 90 days while the agency decides the executive's appeal for reinstatement. Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, writing for the court, said a bank executive's `` interest in continued employment is without doubt an important interest that ought not be interrupted without substantial justification.'' But <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said, a suspended officer also `` has an interest in seeing that a decision concerning his or her continued suspension is not made with excessive haste.'' The case stems from the indictment in 1986 of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallen </PERSON>, president of the now defunct <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kanawha </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, on charges he made false statements to the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mallen </PERSON> was accused of concealing financial interests in other businesses and of concealing loans his banks made. His small agricultural bank in a town of 750 people had assets of $ 18 million. He was convicted in federal court last year and sentenced to three years in prison and fined $ 10,000. He was ordered to spend only 60 days in jail and the rest of the sentence was suspended. Prior to his criminal trial, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> barred him from continuing as bank president and director, prohibited him from taking part in running the bank and said he could not vote his stock in the bank's holding company The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> acted under a law empowering federal banking regulators to suspend executives charged with crimes involving dishonesty or breach of trust that are punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. The law gives the executive a right to appeal to the regulatory agency. But the statute allows the agency to take up to three months to resolve the appeal. Moreover, the law does not guarantee the banker a chance to present oral arguments in making the appeal. A federal judge ruled <PERSON> Mallen </PERSON>'s rights were violated by the suspension and by the ban on oral testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, appealed the ruling to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The case is <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Mallen </PERSON>, 87-82.

<TEXT>
 Jury selection began today in the case of a Jordanian-American couple who allegedly hired a hit man to kill their daughter's husband, his mother and his sister, and cut off pieces of their bodies as souvenirs. The murder plot, which the prosecution says was hatched because the daughter had been promised to someone else in a marriage arranged by the parents, never was carried out. The case of Dr. <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarawneh </PERSON>, 46, and his 44-year-old wife, <PERSON> Ghada </PERSON>, involves a clash between the American ways of love and the family's culture, where murder to avenge one's honor is acceptable, their lawyer says. `` Keeping body parts as souvenirs _ I do n't think is normal,'' said Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimitrouleas </PERSON>, adding that he expects unusual testimony in the <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trial. After several routine motions, jury selection began late this morning. The parents left <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> 18 years ago and lived in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. When their daughter married her Syrian cousin in 1986 and moved to <LOCATION> Tamarac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, tradition required that insult to be avenged, the prosecution says. The parents, arrested February in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, are accused of conspiracy and solicitation to commit murder for allegedly hiring an assassin and attempting to have the victims' body parts preserved and shipped to <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>. A private investigator that prosecutors say the couple hired to find a hit man cooperated with authorities in their criminal investigation. The assassin was supposed to receive an initial $ 500 and $ 2,000 after the killings, according to authorities. Agents taped phone conversations between the investigator and the family, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Breece </PERSON>, an investigator with the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION>. Defense attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Roderman </PERSON> said threats about killing and cutting off body parts are common in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, but are seldom carried out. `` There's a definite clash of cultures here between the Arab mind and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> mind,'' he said. `` The Tarawnehs are from a tribe where they handle their problems their own way, inside the family.'' The parents declined to comment. <PERSON> Tarawneh </PERSON>, a gynecologist who became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen in 1980, and his wife, a nurse, already had arranged a marriage for their then 17-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Raniah </PERSON>, and refused to allow her to marry <PERSON> Mouataz </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdulsalam </PERSON>, now 28. `` My father said, ` Do n't mention this again,''' the daughter said in a sworn statement. `` I think he was against the whole idea of me marrying someone I wanted to.'' The alleged targets were their unwanted son-in-law, his younger sister <PERSON> Azza </PERSON> and his mother <PERSON> Najwa </PERSON>, 45.

<HEAD>Justices Pave Way for Some Deregulation; Consumer Benefit Eyed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a decision the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration says could save consumers an estimated $ 100 million a year, cleared the way today for price deregulation of some natural gas. The justices, 8-0, reversed an appeals court ruling that had placed a floor under the gas prices. The appeals court ruling was challenged by the administration, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and natural gas distributors who buy from producers. The dispute was over interpretation of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, a federal law that phases out regulation of natural gas prices and is designed to assure an adequate supply of gas for delivery across state lines. Prior to the law's enactment, there was a ceiling on the price of gas sold interstate but no such regulation for gas produced and sold within the same state. The two-tier system prompted producers to commit more of their supplies to the intrastate market, causing shortages in interstate supplies of natural gas. The 1978 law created a complicated system of phasing out price controls that divides gas into three categories _ old, new and difficult-to-produce gas. Generally, the price regulations applied more to old gas and lifted controls for new gas to encourage discoveries and production. Old gas is that produced from wells operating before the law was passed, and new gas is that from wells that began producing after the law's passage. The third category covers gas produced by particuarly high-cost methods, such as that obtained from between layers of more impervious rock. The gas supplies involved in the case decided today overlap the categories, qualifying for both regulated and deregulated treatment under the 1978 law. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 eliminated controls for such `` dually qualified'' gas _ allowing the price to be determined by the free market. The commission said maintaining controls would lead to a regulated price higher than the free-market price _ an opposite effect from the one intended by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in enacting the 1978 law. But the 10th Circuit court, acting on appeals by gas producers, said the commission's deregulation rule violated the 1978 law. Writing for the high court today, Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said the appeals court wrongly overturned the commission's rule. He said the commission's interpretation of the 1978 law was correct. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> did not participate in the case for unannounced reasons. The case is <ORGANIZATION> FERC </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 87-363.

 Fire broke out at a freight terminal early today, forcing officials to evacuate more than 800 people and close schools because of pesticides stored in the building, officials said. The fire at a Roadway Express terminal, in a primarily residential area just outside the city, was reported about 12:30 a.m., said fire Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON>. No serious injuries were reported. A dark gray cloud shifted after daybreak and blew several hundred feet above a school where most evacuees were taken. Polyvinyl chloride containers caught fire late in the morning, prompting firefighters to pour water on the blaze to extinguish it. The containers were smoldering, and authorities were concerned that the smoke could cause watering of the eyes, nausea and diarrhea. All public and parochial schools in Alliance were closed today, and officials in two districts east of the city also closed some schools. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> McNabb </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> chapter, estimated that 800 people, including 90 nursing home residents, were at <ORGANIZATION> Stanton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Other evacuees went to the homes of relatives and friends. By mid-morning, residents were returning to the nursing homes because, officials said, they would be better off there than in the crowded school gymnasium. `` We're quite happy there are no major medical problems,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON>, a physician at <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> who went to the school. `` Most of the medical problems we've seen are the chronic ongoing kind. There are only one or two patients complaining of symptoms that might be associated with a toxic chemical such as burning eyes and nausea.'' Evacuees came from about 10 square miles around the fire. <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Benincasa </PERSON> urged other people to remain indoors because of drifting smoke. The evacuation was ordered after officials discovered a pesticide company stored chemicals in the building, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>, manager of spill response for the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Officials could not immediately determine what types of chemical fumes might be in the air. `` Most pesticides break down readily in high temperature,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report Says Fish Farm Can Be Large- or Small-Scale Operation</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A sharpened consumer appetite for fish and seafood offers an opportunity for American farmers to reel in a share of a growing worldwide aquaculture industry, says a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Expanding world population and growing consumer demands have already forced some nations to harvest `` previously underutilized species'' of fish and seafood, and to develop alternative sources, the report said. `` Many commercial fisheries, which harvest from the wild, are approaching their maximum sustainable yield,'' it added. `` Thus aquaculture _ growing fish or other aquatic life in a controlled environment _ is expanding.'' Americans are also honing their appetites, last year consuming more fish and seafood per person than veal, lamb and mutton, roasting chicken or turkey. Beef, pork and broiler chicken, however, remain far in the lead as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> favorites. In 1980, aquaculture accounted for 13 percent of the global production of aquatic foods and goods, up from 7 percent in 1970. Industry sources indicate that by the year 2010 aquaculture will provide 25 percent of the worldwide aquatic harvest. The report was included in the June issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine issued by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The article was written by economists <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>. By 1981, total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fish consumption had grown 30 percent from 1970. About 47 percent was imported. `` Population growth accounts for only half the increase,'' the report added. `` Per capita <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption of fish and shellfish has grown, reaching a record 15.4 pounds -LRB- edible weight -RRB- in 1987. It is expected to expand another 50 percent by 2010.'' <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that the 1987 per capita consumption figure included only 0.5 pound of the estimated 3 to 5 pounds per capita of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aquaculture production. The half pound, he said, only included catfish and none of the other species, ranging from trout and salmon to oysters and shrimp. Despite the recent increases, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> per capita fish and seafood consumption is well behind <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which averages 40 to 45 pounds per person, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which averages 130 to 140 pounds annually. Per capita consumption of veal last year by Americans averaged 1.5 pounds; lamb and mutton, 1.3; mature chicken, 2.5; and turkey, 15.2. Beef consumption was 75.5 pounds; pork, 58.8; and broiler chicken, 60.1. Those are retail weights as sold by grocery stores. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aquaculture industry _ fish farming _ has expanded greatly in recent years but still is led by catfish, produced primarily in the South. In 1986, for example, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aquaculture harvest was nearly 620 million pounds valued at more than $ 496 million. Of those amounts, catfish comprised 327 million pounds worth $ 229 million to growers, the report showed. Comparatively, in 1980 the total harvest was 203 million pounds valued at $ 192 million, with catfish comprising less than 77 million pounds at a value of $ 54 million. Catfish, crawfish, salmon and trout make up about 90 percent of the total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aquaculture production. By 2010, according to industry estimates, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aquaculture production is expected to exceed 2 billion pounds, and that does n't count production from `` catch-out'' ponds and direct sales to consumers, the report said A study in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> showed that for every 10 million additional pounds of catfish produced, 220 new jobs are created in the industry, and 1,100 jobs are created in related industries. Most catfish are grown in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, while salmon output is mainly in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, crawfish in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and trout in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Channel catfish east mostly soybean products and corn. To get a pound of catfish requires one pound of soybean meal, a half pound of corn meal, and a half pound of other nutrients. Nearly 55 percent of the usual diet of farm-grown salmon are also from the farm _ 17 percent whey, 16.5 percent wheat germ, 15 percent cottonseed meal, and 6 percent soybean oil. The report said aquaculture is suited to small as well as commercial farms and that a modest operation can provide significant income. `` Many agricultural institutions still regard aquaculture as a sideline,'' the report said. `` Even so, aquaculture has become a technical and highly capitalized commercial enterprise.'' One problem has been the `` limited information'' available to potential lenders, the report said. As a result, it added, many federal agencies have been reluctant to aid aquaculture producers financially.

 Muscovites responding to their first peek at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television news say they wish it had more music and less talk, but they still are wide-eyed over glimpses into the personal lives of government leaders and average Americans _ even when they do n't understand the language <ORGANIZATION> Cables </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> is being broadcast into central <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> during the summit under an agreement with the state broadcast agency <PERSON> Gostelradio </PERSON>. Those Muscovites lucky enough to own recent model television sets can pick it up on Channel 6. It also is available in the Rossiya Hotel overlooking Red Square, where many foreign journalists are staying. Maids and plainclothes <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents are often seen sitting together before television sets in halls, watching attentively and sometimes with the volumn off. For most, it marks the first time they have seen fast-paced, round-the-clock, up-close-and-personal American television. Television news imported from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a far cry from the Soviet evening news show Vremya. The show has been jazzed up in recent months with new graphics and backdrops, but it is still dry and focuses on agricultural reports and Politburo announcements. A 46-year-old clerk who would only give her first name, <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON>, said she was watching <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> news this week as often as she could. `` I enjoyed learning something about the private life of former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>,'' she said, smiling shyly. `` I saw him on a fishing trip. For us, this is very unusual.'' `` I would like to see such things about General Secretary -LRB- <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Vremya. But for the moment, we have only rumors about his personal life,'' she said. <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON> said she understood some English. But a lack of language comprehension has not stopped Soviets from tuning in to <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>, sometimes for hours. `` We've watched at least two hours a night all this week, even though I do n't know any English,'' said <PERSON> Lyubov </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanova </PERSON>, 50. `` I wish it had more music, but I'm still very interested. It is nice to see President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and now I would like to see one of his movies.'' Both <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Ivanova </PERSON> said they were disappointed that the stories on American television, which last an average of two or three minutes, were so short. On Soviet television, an item like a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> speech can take up the entire newscast, which is sometimes extended to two hours. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> producer <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Oxenberg </PERSON> said the network was broadcasting its program only in central <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and had received comments and telephone calls from Soviets which indicated it was widely watched. `` We know sometimes official Soviets are not happy about the way we do our reporting, but we think it is good for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that we were allowed to do this,'' she said. Moscow-born <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON>, 25, agreed. `` I think it is important to see even these small pieces of the lives of Americans,'' <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> said. `` We Soviets may be able to learn things that could help us,'' he said. `` For example, the Americans seem so relaxed and social compared with us. Maybe we can learn how to take it easy by watching them.'' <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> said he was disappointed to learn <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> would go off the air here once President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Thursday. `` It's too bad,'' he said `` I wish American TV could stay here and our show Vremya could go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Bomb Explosion in Punjab Market Kills 6, Wounds 32</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bomb hidden in a plastic bag exploded in the crowded vegetable market of a Hindu town in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state Tuesday, killing six people and wounding at least 32, police reported. They blamed Sikh extremists for planting the bomb in the market at <LOCATION> Dinanagar </LOCATION>, 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, the Sikh holy city. It went off at about 6:30 a.m. as people were beginning their morning shopping, said D.S. <PERSON> Khala </PERSON>, deputy police commissioner of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. He said most of the victims were Hindus. <LOCATION> Dinanagar </LOCATION> is in the <LOCATION> Gurdaspur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, where seven bombs have killed at least 13 people this year. The bombings are blamed on extremists who have been fighting since 1982 for an independent Sikh nation in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, the only Indian state where the sect has a majority. On Monday, an explosion in a crowded market in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> killed 23 people and wounded 44. Police initially said the cause appeared to be the accidental ignition of a propane gas cylinder. But the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Suresh </PERSON> <PERSON> Arora </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> district police chief, on Tuesday as saying it was a bomb, probably set off by remote control. Authorities blamed Sikh extremists for the <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> explosion. Two Hindu-dominated political parties sponsored a general protest strike Tuesday in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> that closed many stores and offices. The bombing deaths and the killing of a Sikh man Tuesday in the <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> district raised to at least 1,230 the number of deaths blamed on <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> radicals in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> so far this year, 200 more than the 1,030 in all of 1987. Most of the gunmen's targets are Hindus, but they also kill Sikh moderates. Police defused two bombs in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> residential neighborhood Tuesday, and a bomb scare delayed the departure of a Paris-bound <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> jet for more than 16 hours, Indian news agencies reported. Press Trust of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> said the two bombs were found in a plastic bag in the <LOCATION> Kailash </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nagar </LOCATION> neighborhood and defused by the police bomb disposal squad. Air <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s Flight 123 to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> was delayed because an anonymous telephone caller said a bomb was aboard, but a search revealed no explosives, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said. There was no claim of responsibility for either incident in the capital. Thousands of people have been killed since Sikh militants began their violent campaign for a homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, a rich northwestern state that is <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s main agricultural region. <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION> was founded 500 years ago as an alternative to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam. Members of the sect, who make up only 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people, claim discrimination by the predominant Hindus.

<HEAD>Teachers Begin Indefinite Strike; Classes Put off for 2Oth Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Schoolteachers began a strike for more pay Tuesday. It was the 20th time in the past three months that public schools have been closed because of teacher work stoppages. Unlike past strikes, this one was called for an indefinite period. It was the first indefinite work stoppage by civil servants in the public administration since <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> returned to democracy in 1977. The strike meant no classes for the nearly 6 million students in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s public elementary, secondary and technical schools. There is just one month left in the regular school year. The six unions representing <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s 272,000 public schoolteachers approved the indefinite strike Thursday. The government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> broke off negotiations after the strike was approved. Teachers are demanding pay parity with civil servants of similar qualifications and monthly pay increases of $ 223 by September 1990. Teachers at elementary schools earn an average of $ 929 a month. Teachers at secondary and technical schools earn about $ 1,090 a month. On May 4, five of the six teachers unions reached a tentative agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> for a monthly pay increase of $ 178 by September 1990. The teachers branch of the Communist-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissions </ORGANIZATION> union opposed the pact, and a referendum was held May 16. Of the teachers who voted, 75 percent rejected the pact. A government decree published last week forces teachers to guarantee students their required tests and final exams by June 30 or face suspension from their jobs for three to six years. The unions said teachers would comply. In announcing the breaking off of talks last week, government spokesman <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> <PERSON> Varela </PERSON>, said `` this kind of strike is unjustified.'' `` It threatens the constitutionally guaranteed right of education for students and impedes further talks in search of a reasonable and just solution,'' <PERSON> Varela </PERSON> added. The National Confederation of Student Associations has criticized the teachers' indefinite strike, as has the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION>.

 As <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> moves closer to the Democratic presidential nomination, some <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Democrats are pressing him to choose Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> as his running mate. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, for one, is heading a group of Floridians writing Graham-promoting letters to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as well as to uncommitted Democratic delegates and other party leaders. The group has distributed 500 `` <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> for V.P.'' buttons, and <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said a formal committee will be put together as the Graham-backers expand. `` We're trying to create a national awareness that he is a viable possibility,'' said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, adding that the committee hopes to flood the national convention in July with <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> banners, signs and stickers. Another active <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> supporter is state <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> is not only a favorite son, he's a very strong candidate,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` He was a very popular Southern governor, and he would bring a Southern flavor to the ticket.'' Other <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Democrats have mixed feelings about the effort by <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> supporters, one of the better organized efforts across the country to promote possible vice presidential candidates. Though many Democrats want <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a Northeasterner, to pick a Southerner, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> is n't the most frequently mentioned possibility from that region. `` Not to take anything away from <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> because <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> is very qualified, but my strong recommendation would be <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>,'' the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> senator, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> attorney and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, `` Senator <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> is not seeking a spot on the ticket. He is not active in trying to make the phone ring. He has been flattered by the suggestion that it might ring.'' Meanwhile, state <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> feels pulled in two directions. `` The greatest thing for me as party chairman would be <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> on the ticket, because I believe that would ensure us of carrying <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said. `` But the worst thing for me would be to have Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> get to appoint a senator.'' If <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> were elected vice president, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor would appoint someone to serve as senator until a special election in 1990.

 Some drums of chemical waste aboard a freighter dubbed the `` ship of poison'' are damaged, and guinea pigs will be used to see if any dangerous substance is leaking, the port commissioner said Tuesday. More than 2,200 tons of unidentified wastes from Italian chemical companies are in about 12,000 drums aboard the freighter Zanoobia, which docked in <LOCATION> Genoa </LOCATION> on Sunday after spending more than a month anchored off the coast of <PERSON> Carrara </PERSON>. The wastes were originally shipped from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> 15 months ago but were rejected by four countries before officials in <LOCATION> Genoa </LOCATION> agreed to let them unload. <LOCATION> Genoa </LOCATION> port commissioner <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Francese </PERSON> said the guinea pigs will be lowered into the ship's holds to see if they suffer any toxic effects. <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizzuto </PERSON>, a lawyer for the ship's owner, <ORGANIZATION> Tabalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION>, said a chemical analysis of the wastes must be completed before the unloading begins. <PERSON> Francese </PERSON> said the entire process, including unloading, transport and incineration of the wastes, could take two months. The Zanoobia is the last of three freighters used to ship the wastes to ports in <LOCATION> Djibouti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and then back to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` We could have vetoed docking of the ship in an Italian port, but it looked like an unfair decision since the waste had originated from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Francese </PERSON> said. Lawyers for Tabalo Shipping say two people have died, possibly after being contaminated by the wastes. A boy in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> died after playing near the cargo, and a <LOCATION> Zanoobia </LOCATION> crewman died during the voyage to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. Five crewmen were hospitalized last month with symptoms possibly caused by exposure to the wastes. Three others were treated and released Monday. Dock workers walked off the job Monday to protest the smell and fumes spreading from the <LOCATION> Zanoobia </LOCATION>, but they returned to work Tuesday because the ship was moved to a more isolated part of the port. The wastes originally were shipped from the Tuscan port of <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> di </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carrara </LOCATION> in February 1987. <PERSON> Rizzuto </PERSON> said a group of Italian chemical companies paid the Milan-based company Jelly Wax about 40 cents a pound to dispose of the waste. He said the company instead shipped it out of the country. The first ship took it to <LOCATION> Djibouti </LOCATION>, then to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, where it was unloaded. After the boy died, the government ordered the wastes shipped out of the country. It was loaded on a second ship bound for <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, where it was transferred to the <LOCATION> Zanoobia </LOCATION>. That ship made one stop in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> before it took the wastes back to <PERSON> Carrara </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said today he has `` earned consideration'' as a vice presidential candidate if <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should beat him for the Democratic presidential nomination. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, while refusing to give up his own fight for the top spot on the ticket, said of front-runner <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` If he wins, I've earned consideration.'' He said that if he wins the nomination he will give <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the same consideration. The civil rights activist also was to give a speech on urban policy today, one week before elections in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> close out the Democratic primary season. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> today that he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> must work together to defeat Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s all-but-certain nominee. `` Together, we must use our combined strength to change the course,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` If I put forth a vision, then reward me,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who is expected to win enough delegates to sew up the nomination next Tuesday, said Sunday that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would have a major role at the Democratic National Convention and in the fall campaign. On Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who upset Jews and others by calling nearby new York `` Hymietown'' in his presidential bid four years ago, issued a Memorial Day call for blacks and Jews to unite. Feelings were still high in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary this spring, and Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said Jews would have to be crazy to vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> drew cheers in <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION> from a mixed crowd of black and white supporters. Citing the holiday and its commemoration of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s war dead, he told a story of black <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers coming upon a Nazi concentration camp in World War II. He offered the meeting between the GIs and Jewish survivors as an example of how blacks and Jews might unite now. `` Can not the sons and daughters of the victims of the Holocaust and the sons and daughters of slaves find common ground? That is the challenge of our day,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. He added, to cheers, `` Let's take a journey. Let's take our nation beyond anti-Semitism.'' In the past week, as the primary season draws to a close, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been making policy statements, coupled with a call for his proposals to be included in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> platform. Last week in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, he released a five-year budget plan, and has been urging front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to adopt some of his foreign policy views. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is well ahead of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in polls taken in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said Monday he expected <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would have a role in his likely fall campaign against <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> concurred. `` I expect to have a big role at the convention and a big role this fall,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` That role has not been determined ... I will exercise my own options.'' On Monday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> observed Memorial Day with a call for world peace. `` Study war no more,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a crowd as he campaigned here. `` Nations must not rise up against nations.'' He also laid a wreath at a war memorial. `` War is absurd. War is obscene. Peace is reasonable,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Earlier, at a rally at city hall in nearby <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> talked about the thousands of Vietnam War veterans who can not afford housing while the nation spends billions of dollars on defense. `` We're not just sacrificing veterans, we're sacrificing old people, we're sacrificing sick people, we're sacrificing the homeless,'' he said. `` I want to lead our nation beyond war.''

 The chimes from Spassky Tower heralded President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Tuesday as <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> led his guest onto the ancient cobblestones of Red Square _ stones so famous that even a reformer would n't think of repaving them. They first turned in the direction of St. Basil's Cathedral with its multicolored facade and onion domes. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gazed upward at the 15th century cathedral as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pointed and apparently explained some of its features. The square that draws millions of Russian and foreign tourists annually had been swept clear of people, save for the single-file line of those waiting silently to enter the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> mausoleum, and eight groups of selected Soviets standing by to meet <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` So let us welcome the president,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said as he approached one of the groups of about 25 people, who burst into applause with shouts of hello. Bystanders voiced concerns ranging from nuclear war to cooperation in space between the superpowers. `` You should apply some pressure on the president. You are always pressuring me for results,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> joked to the crowd when peace issues were broached. The two leaders emerged from the Kremlin onto the square shortly after the changing of the guard at <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION>'s tomb. The colorful ceremony is performed hourly and draws crowds of tourists, even at midnight. After strolling past the cathedral, the red-painted <ORGANIZATION> Spassky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, the contemporary marble structure where the body of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> rests, and the fur trees planted along its edge, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proclaimed the square `` Beautiful.'' `` This is our flag waving over the Kremlin,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proudly told the president. `` And there,'' he said, pointing over the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> wall to the area behind the mausoleum, `` is one of the most beautiful rooms in the Kremlin, perhaps in the world.'' As they walked along the cobblestones of Red Square, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> remarked: `` There should be no perestroika _ no rebuilding here.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in explaining the history of area, pointed toward the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> side of Red Square and to where he said <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> had worked. The leaders walked in the area of the mausoleum, but <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not enter to see the embalmed body of the founder of the Soviet state. `` We want friendship between the two people,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told bystanders. `` What we have decided to do is to talk to each other rather than about each other. And that's working.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gently chided <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for saying `` some critical things'' during their talks. `` I do the same thing about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he added. `` But I see that some of this is based on misconceptions about each other.'' As they strolled, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> quoted a few Russian proverbs, adding what he called an extension to one of them. `` If arguments are at the boiling point, then truth evaporates,'' he said. `` So we should have dialogue.'' At one point, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> seemed to think <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was dwelling too long on past exchanges of criticism. Putting his arm around <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s shoulder, he said, `` Before this goes too far, let's do something.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reached out in one group to take a little boy into his arms. The boy, <PERSON> Alyosha </PERSON> <PERSON> Filatov </PERSON>, peered at <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as the general secretary asked, `` Do you recognize President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>?'' The little boy looked at <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, saying nothing.

 Four murals that may be <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s oldest wall paintings have been restored after years hidden under paint and varnish and go on display Wednesday, showing a whimsical side to colonial <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> life. The three walls surrounding the central stairway of <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> are thought to have been painted around 1716 when the mansion, now a National Historic Landmark, was built for a ship captain The first scene, at the foot of the stairway, shows a woman working at a spinning wheel, a standard symbol of hearth and home, said conservationist <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, who supervised the restoration. But the coziness ends quickly. Next to the woman, a dog barks at an eagle that has just swooped down to snatch a dead, bleeding chicken in its claws. Up the stairs, in a biblical scene, <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> raises a sword over his head to kill his son <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON>. And guarding the landing are two formally dressed Indian chiefs _ the king of the Mohawk <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> tribe and Prince of the Rivers _ invited to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in 1710 to discuss an alliance against French colonists in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Only at the top of the stairs is there a gentleman on horseback, perhaps a military officer, whose red coat, three-cornered hat and white wig restore the image of stately, puritanical <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. What the 500 square feet of paintings mean, who painted them and why the scenes were put together as they were are mysteries. But <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> says their theatrical qualities indicate a freer colonial lifestyle than is generally acknowledged. `` It's not what often comes to mind,'' she said. `` The dainty people, their tea parties, can you imagine them living with this stuff roaring at them every day?'' `` This is so bold and playful, it's hard to understand right away, but in fact these should help us understand better the way people lived. It's not the dainty people rustling around with pursed lips. They were wild people. They wore pink skirts and wigs and they were playful.'' Whether the murals are the oldest of their kind depends on whether the man on the horse is <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> MacPhaedris </PERSON>, the home's original owner, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, a former curator and director of folk art museums in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Williamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. She believes the man is `` As far as I know, they are the earliest extant interior wall paintings in the 13 colonies,'' she said. <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>'s work at <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> included stripping away damage by earlier restorers. Two walls had been concealed under wallpaper. The most recent restoration attempt was in the early 1950s, when a colored varnish was added to cover imperfections and make the paintings look antique, she said. <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> and several assistants started work Feb. 1. They used techniques learned working on wall paintings from ancient <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, the only other society that decorated ordinary homes in such a way. After the old paint was stripped and the chipping paint stabilized, they filled cracks with `` gesso,'' an ancient mix of natural Italian calcium carbonate and rabbit-skin glue. <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> did not do fresh painting. `` These are old paintings and they've been through a lot, and I'm not going to push them with a lot of make-up and make them look new,'' she said. `` Let it be old.'' The project was paid for by the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which raised $ 100,000 from residents and foundations. The home was a private residence until the 1930s, when money was raised to buy it to prevent it from being torn down to make way for a gas station, said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, a past president of the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Many colonial murals were destroyed by Americans who did not realize their worth, <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> Pompeii </LOCATION> paintings were decorations of houses, just like ours,'' she noted. `` They -LRB- Americans -RRB- go off to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to look at other people's paintings then come home and rip out their walls.''

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had the campaign trail to himself today, pushing for the Democratic presidential nomination but talking about the vice presidency, as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent the day at his <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> home and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> worked at his <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, while still pressing his presidential bid in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, said that if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> beats him `` I've earned consideration'' for the No. 2 spot on the party's election ticket. He said he would give <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the same consideration if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wins the nomination. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who is expected to sew up the nomination in next Tuesday's primaries in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, planned to fly to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to resume campaigning on Wednesday. `` Together, we must use our combined strength to change the course,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said today. `` If I put forth a vision, then reward me.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> both said over the Memorial Day weekend that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would play a major part in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' expected fall campaign against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But both said the nature of that role had n't yet been worked out. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was meeting with economists today at <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, has been taking a beating in recent public opinion surveys matching him against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He has said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration controversies were probably partly to blame for his showing. He has n't singled out Attorney Gen. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> as one of those sore points, but both <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have criticized the attorney general, who is under criminal investigation, and have urged him to quit. The vice president, who has refused to call for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s resignation, confirmed Monday that the two recently met privately <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declined to detail what was discussed, but when asked if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had promised to keep from hurting his campaign, he told reporters: `` Yes, yes, I think it's fair to say that.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> on Monday night, said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had `` talked frankly about the campaign,'' and said he believed it would harm <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> if he were to step down at this time. `` If I were to quit now, for example, it would be a real liability because people would say there was something wrong,'' said the attorney general. `` I think it's important to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ... as well as myself that the record be set straight.'' However, in the interview on the `` Larry King Live'' show, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> left open the possibility that he might leave office by the end of the summer. Pressed by guest host <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide, as to whether he might step down by Labor Day, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> responded: `` I do n't think I'd rule anything in or anything out.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he does n't want to comment on the <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> matter until after an independent counsel's report is issued. The vice president says he expects that will be soon. In any event, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has a `` remarkable record that will be an asset to any Republican running for office this fall.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was turning his attention today to economic affairs. He had meetings scheduled with advisers including <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was spending today at the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. On Monday, he met with black supporters from around the country and told them that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would play a part in the campaign leading up to his expected November face-off with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I think we can put together as strong a coalition that has ever been put together for any presidential campaign,'' the governor told reporters after the closed session. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who was campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, said he expected to have `` a big role'' at the convention and in the fall, but said it had n't been worked out yet. `` I will exercise my own options,'' he said. There are 466 Democratic delegates at stake in next Tuesday's primaries _ enough to put <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over the 2,081 needed to nominate The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor can lay claim to more than 1,700 delegates now, compared with fewer than 1,000 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, however, has his own agenda. He has been using the final primary campaigns to push forward the ideas he wants incorporated into the party platform, and to underline the historic nature of his presidential effort. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' sole remaining rival for the nomination, out of the eight Democrats who declared their candidacies. `` Never forget this campaign,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told supporters on Sunday. All three candidates made Memorial Day observances on Monday. The vice president gave a speech in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>'s town square after the local Memorial Day parade. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pointed to the superpower summit under way in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, saying the arms control agreement eliminating intermediate-range weapons would not have been reached `` if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had not been strong.'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> sounded a pacifist theme as he paid tribute to those who died in battle. `` Study war no more,'' he told a crowd as he campaigned in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty. `` Nations must not rise up against nations.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> attended a Memorial Day service in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Algae Carpet Spreads to Danish Waters, Threatens Tourism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A blanket of yellow sea algae that killed hundreds of tons of fish along the coasts of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> is now threatening Danish fishing and tourism, officials said Tuesday. `` There has been a significant drop in fish exports since the explosive growth of algae in Danish waters in recent days,'' said <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Toerring </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Dead fish were found in three locations along the coast of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> since the algae spread from the southern coasts of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> last week, <PERSON> Toerring </PERSON> said in a statement. Tests were being conducted to determine whether the fish were killed by the algae, which suffocates fish by clogging their gills. `` There is nothing to indicate that the growth of algae has culminated,'' said <PERSON> Henrik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandbech </PERSON>, deputy director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The agency's emergency staff is worried that the algae could spread even further along the coast later this week, when winds are forecast to shift. Experts blamed nitrates from agricultural fertilizers and phosphorus from sewage and industrial pollution for the dramatic growth of the single-cell plants. Carpets of algae up to 10 feet thick have been found about 33 feet under the surface of the water. Resort owners along the west coast of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Jutland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> fear news of the algae might ruin the lucrative tourist trade this summer. `` If the algae plague gets worse in the next 14 days, we risk a nose dive in the number of West German tourists,'' said <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON>, head of tourism in west <LOCATION> Jutland </LOCATION>. Tourism is a $ 2.3 billion business in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, and about 10 percent of that amount comes from <LOCATION> Jutland </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, fish farmers were advised by marine biologists to kill their fish. As a result, the farmers have lost salmon, sea trout and other domestically grown fish worth $ 38.5 million. Some fish, particularly herring and flounder that swim at the bottom of the sea, have not been as hard hit as fish cultivated in pens. Some major fish farms in western <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> began towing their pens away from coastal areas into <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s deep, cool fiords to avoid the algae threat. Danish authorities have dispatched two marine environment research vessels to the <ORGANIZATION> Skagerrak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strait </ORGANIZATION> between <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Kattegat </LOCATION> belt between <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> to monitor the growth and movement of the algae. Swedish Environment Minister <PERSON> Birgitta </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> called for a special session of the <ORGANIZATION> Nordic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ an association of Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, <LOCATION> Danish </LOCATION> and Finnish parliamentarians _ to deal with the algae threat in the Baltic and North seas.

<HEAD>Treasury Official Says Ailing S&amp;L Industry Must First Help Itself</HEAD>

 A senior <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official says when the federal fund that insures deposits in savings institutions needs more money, the industry _ not taxpayers _ should make the first contribution. `` There comes a point ... when you're really burdening the industry so that it's self defeating,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, undersecretary for finance. `` But I do n't think you're there yet.'' In an interview recently that touched on the stock market, the debate over new powers for banks and the condition of the nation's savings institutions, the pipe-puffing former investment banker said it seems probable that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will need more money beyond the infusion provided by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last August <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, the No. 3 official at treasury, is the administration's top policymaker for banking and finance He has been mentioned as a likely successor to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, should <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> resign as expected this summer to run the presidential campaign of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> estimates it will cost $ 21.8 billion to clean up the roughly 500 insolvent S & amp; Ls. However, private analysts say it could cost between $ 50 billion and $ 64 billion. The insurance fund is expected to have only about $ 20 billion to work with over three years. Most of that is coming from $ 10.8 billion in bond sales, which are being paid off by a special assessment on the industry. The $ 64 billion figure is `` absurd,'' <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said, but he conceded, `` that $ 20 billion is probably not enough.'' The question is when and how to provide more money. In the debate last year, the administration urged a $ 15 billion bond sale, while the industry was pushing to hold it to $ 5 billion. The $ 10.8 billion was a last-minute compromise. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said the industry could pay for another $ 5 billion bond sale, although he conceded that another $ 15 billion probably would be too much. Leaders of the industry's largest trade group, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, say healthy S & amp; Ls are paying all they can without deteriorating financially. `` It's a clever maneuver, but it's not clever enough,'' <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said of the league's position. `` The new gambit that ` Gee, it's too big for us to handle' means ` Gee, the taxpayers have got to bail us out,''' he said. Merging the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as a means of avoiding a taxpayer bailout is a bad idea, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said, because it would damage confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., who is expected to become chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> next year, said two weeks ago that <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls will be at the top of the committee's list of priorities when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns after the November elections <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said it might help public confidence if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> began re-examining the problem next year, but he said, for now, <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> has all it can spend without beginning to flood the market with foreclosed real estate. The debate `` should be done in kind of a thoughtful environment, not ` Gee, we ought to respond to a crisis,' because there is not a near-term crisis,'' he said. The S & amp; L mess was one of <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>'s first assignments after being appointed in November 1985. Through last fall and winter, he led administration's push for the repeal of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which prevents commercial banks from underwriting most securities. Most recently, he headed an interagency working group that formulated the administration's policy response to the October stock market crash. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said he was cheered by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s lopsided, 94-2 approval of a bill substantially repealing Glass-Steagall. However, he said he has been a little discouraged by the slow pace of the bill in the House. He puts the bill's chances of enactment at 50-50. Regarding Democratic criticism of the administration's stock market policy, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> conceded that the working group recommended few changes. But, he said, `` We do n't think a lot of the suggested changes are really worth a damn.'' <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, instead of looking for a quick fix, should be looking at the root causes of greater market volatility such as the fact that more and more stock is being concentrated in the hands of a few professional managers of pension funds, mutual funds and college endowments. `` I do n't want people to feel better if there is no reason to feel better, because that will take their eye off looking at some more fundamental things. ... Maybe greater volatility is inherent in greater concentrations of capital,'' he said.

 Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions taken Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. GRAY MARKET The court ruled the bulk of so-called `` gray market'' goods are legal, giving a green light to a big part of a multi-billion-dollar business that allows consumers to buy costly, brand-name imports at steep discounts. In another case, the court ruled that states sometimes may execute convicted murderers even if their constitutional right to a lawyer's help was violated. The case is K Mart vs. <ORGANIZATION> Cartier </ORGANIZATION>, 86-495. CAPITAL PUNISHMENT The court ruled that states sometimes may execute convicted murderers even if their constitutional right to a lawyer's help was violated. By a 5-3 vote, the justices said for the first time that errors in which a convicted murderer's constitutional right to a lawyer's help was violated may be deemed `` harmless. But the justices voted 8-0 in stating that such an error in the prosecution of convicted <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> murderer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Satterwhite </PERSON> was not harmless. The decision overturned his death sentence. The case is <PERSON> Satterwhite </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 86-6284. FIREFIGHTERS The court refused to reinstate an affirmative action plan designed to increase the number of blacks in the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that the plan _ calling for hiring at least six blacks for every l0 job openings _ unlawfully discriminates against whites. The case is <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-1150. CABLE ACCESS The court refused to resurrect federal rules that would force cable television operators to carry all local TV signals on their systems. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that struck down as unconstitutional interim `` must-carry'' rules adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s in 1986. The cases are <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1487; <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> vs. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1506; <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> vs. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1510; and <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> vs. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1551. CHECK-KITING The court left intact a $ 25 million fine against a businessman for what prosecutors called the biggest check-kiting fraud in the history of American banking. The court, citing the lack of a `` substantial federal question'', rejected a challenge to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law that says those convicted in such schemes may be forced to pay fines equal to twice the amount gained through their criminal conduct. The case is <PERSON> Halloran </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 87-1595. TAMPONS The court refused to reduce a jury award of more than $ 11.2 million won from a tampon manufacturer by the family of a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> woman who died of toxic shock syndrome. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> seeking to reduce the award. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> O'Gilvie </PERSON>, 87-1021. NATURAL GAS The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a decision the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration says could save consumers an estimated $ 100 million a year, cleared the way today for price deregulation of some natural gas. The justices, in an 8-0 decision, reversed an appeals court ruling that had placed a floor under the gas prices. The case is <ORGANIZATION> FERC </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 87-363. PUNITIVE DAMAGES The court let stand a $ 5 million punitive-damages award won by a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> savings and loan association against an Ohio-based insurance company. The justices, over two dissenting votes, refused to hear arguments that the award, believed to be the largest of its kind ever upheld in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> courts, is unconstitutionally excessive. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Downey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, 87-159.

<HEAD>Fishing Boat Hits Mine In Gulf Of Oman Killing Fisherman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A small fishing boat with three people aboard hit a mine and exploded in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> on Tuesday, killing one fisherman and injuring two, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> officials said. The official <ORGANIZATION> Emirates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement as saying the incident occurred off <LOCATION> Dednah </LOCATION>, 20 miles south of the entrance to the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. The waters are just north of a major anchorage off <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakkan </PERSON> that is used by tankers and other commercial vessels going to and from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The anchorage is the staging area for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Navy-escorted convoys of American-flagged Kuwaiti tankers bound for <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. There was no word on whether the mine was floating free or tethered to the floor of the gulf. The area was plagued by a spate of mines last fall, and at least two vessels were hit. One, a small offshore supply boat, sank, and six crewmen died. The incidents, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other officials blamed on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, prompted <ORGANIZATION> UAE </ORGANIZATION> authorities to close the anchorage temporarily and were a factor in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> deciding to dispatch mine sweepers to the gulf region. Some of those craft eventually cleared the area, and no mines had been reported in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> for several months prior to Tuesday's incident. The ministry said all of the victims Tuesday were Indians. The two survivors were rescued by another fishing boat and taken for treatment to Fujairah, another port down the coast, it said. Salvage workers at Fujairah were attempting to seal off leaking ammonia from a Liberian-flag, Norwegian-owned gas tanker towed there after being severely damaged in an Iranian gunboat attack on Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said salvage officials may unload the ammonia cargo. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> officials said the cargo had formed a `` poisonous cloud'' around one of the Dutch salvage tugboats that assisted the damaged vessel. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>'s said the ship, the 15,530-ton Mundogas Rio, suffered more minor damage on Monday in a blast believed caused by a rocket-propelled grenade that had earlier failed to explode.

<HEAD>Leadership Race Involves Open Soliciting Of Contributions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The three-way race for a key <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership post is openly moving beyond traditional shoeleather campaigning into the big-bucks realm of special-interest money. In their quest to become chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> caucus, Reps. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, are following the traditional path, buttonholing colleagues in the cloakroom and visiting their offices But Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., applying proven congressional election techniques to an in-House contest, is openly soliciting political action committees and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyists to support his candidacy <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is the first person to openly bring active fund-raising and spending into a race for a leadership post, according to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members and veteran <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> staffers. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> says that the money he raises will be given to Democrats to help their campaigns for election to the House. Oakar and <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> say they are running low-key and low-budget campaigns for the caucus chair, which ranks just behind speaker and majority leader in the Democratic hierarchy and is now filled by Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>. `` I'm not raising money for my caucus chair race,'' says Oakar. `` I've been going to -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- members, just like I go door to door at home. ... I do n't think winning the job or any office in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is dependent on how much money we pass out.'' `` We are running on our own merits,'' <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> says. `` The major expense for us will be coffee and donuts.'' It is not unusual for representatives and senators seeking leadership jobs to make contributions to the political campaigns of colleagues, either from their own campaign funds or from their own `` leadership'' PACs. But until now, all of them, including <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, have insisted that their giving had nothing to do with their leadership candidacies. Critics say the tactic amounts to attempted vote-buying. In February, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> hosted a dinner for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, who each got a $ 1,000 campaign contribution just for showing up. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said he wanted to share his money because he was facing no serious challenge to his re-election to the House this year. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Plebani </PERSON>, his administrative assistant, said the dinner was unrelated to the caucus chair race. Since 1983, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> has given out at least $ 72,400 to Democratic incumbents and challengers, according to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> newsletter, <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. Despite the earlier denials, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> cited the caucus chair campaign in at least two recent mailings sent out under the letterhead of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION>, the political action committee he formed last December. `` I need your active help,'' he said in a May 3 letter. `` I need to raise funds to pursue this new challenge. I would appreciate your sending me a check for $ 500 to $ 1,000 so that I can begin to build the active support within the Democratic members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to win this key leadership position.'' Former Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON>, D-Pa., now a special assistant to <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, said the letters were sent to about 25 to 30 Pennsylvanians who had given to <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON>'s election campaigns Asked how much money he needed for the caucus race and how he planned to spend it, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> replied: `` The PAC is designed to help support good Democratic candidates running for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Support of those candidates is not dependent on whether they support me for caucus chair.'' In another mailing in May, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> cited the caucus contest to people he invited to a breakfast at a restaurant near the Capitol. The letter made no specific appeal for money, but it said anyone wanting to help <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> could contact <PERSON> Plebani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Plebani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Strawser </PERSON> did not return phone calls seeking to identify the recipients of this letter. At least one <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist received one. The open solicitation of money for an in-House election comes as some lawmakers are trying to put brakes on the escalating cost of getting elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> itself. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats trying to enact spending limits have been blocked by Republican filibusters. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a group headed by Rep. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, D-Wash., is ready to start moving a bill once the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passes one <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>'s legislation would ban the type of `` leadership'' PACs established by <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and others.

<TEXT>
 Most Western European newspapers Tuesday applauded President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for putting the stress on human rights at his summit with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. A French official said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s stance would help <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in his efforts to reform the country. <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedrine </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s spokesman, said in a radio interview that when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> speaks of human rights, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` knows it, in a certain way expects it, and even benefits from it because that's part of the evolution he wants for his country.'' No official comment was reported from other European capitals, but many newspapers devoted editorials to analyzing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speeches and actions in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> concerning religious freedom and human rights Most of them gave him high marks. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` has used his first visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> _ and the new opportunities of glasnost _ to take the message of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> citadel. The citadel has not been stormed; but neither is it unscathed,'' commented the conservative Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, adding: `` ... President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> showed, in his forthright American way, that he probably understands the needs of Russians, as people and individuals, as well as Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> does. Unlike Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, however, he has the freedom to put his inner thoughts into words and talk about the spiritual dimension.'' However, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> ` s left-leaning Guardian, was skeptical, saying: `` The human right he -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- seemed, at root, most concerned about was the right of the Soviet people to throw out the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, it is to be hoped, will still be smiling on and after Thursday; but if he is n't, the formidable pack of <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> advisers should pause and ask themselves which humans seeking rights were truly helped by the street theater in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this Monday.'' The Guardian also seized on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s statement that human rights were fundamental to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relationships `` with all nations,'' asking whether this applied to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, the respected conservative paper <PERSON> Die </PERSON> <PERSON> Welt </PERSON> dismissed the argument that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had meddled in Soviet internal matters. It said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not tell the Soviets `` how they should live. He told them that all human beings should have the freedom to live. `` He ... does not believe a nation which denies its own citizens basic human rights deserves the trust of other nations.'' The independent Belgian daily <ORGANIZATION> Het </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belang </ORGANIZATION> van <LOCATION> Limburg </LOCATION> voiced understanding for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s predicament. `` A dictatorship which itself is in the midst of reforms, is very unstable. And in a super-centralized, multi-ethnic nation such as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> such an operation is doubly dangerous,'' it said. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ... balances on a high wire suspended on one end on the ` good old days' and, on the other, on a breakup of the Soviet state.'' In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Venturini </PERSON> wrote in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>'s conservative daily <ORGANIZATION> Corriere </ORGANIZATION> della Sera: `` The message <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is bearing into the wolf's lair is that coexistence must have a moral dimension and that the search for disarmament is inseparable from the reduction in ideological contrasts. ...'' He said that `` if a crack appears in the wall of prohibitions that bears upon the Soviet citizens, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will share part of the credit.'' <PERSON> Sandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s largest daily, commented that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took up human rights because `` he realized that putting pressure on the Russians at this time could lead them to concede what they would have never conceded a number of years ago ...

<TEXT>
 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has cast himself in the summit's lead role, projecting a vital image as statesman, negotiator and presidential tour guide and giving impromptu interviews to reporters. On the eve of the first press conference by a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief on home turf, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Tuesday sped through an ambitious summit itinerary, prolonging a one-on-one session with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, sporting him around Red Square's landmarks and overseeing the signing of arms control protocols _ all before noon. He bantered with reporters before his talks with the president in the morning, insisting that it was `` time to bang our fists on the table'' to get negotiators moving on a strategic arms reduction treaty. Showing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> around Red Square, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> introduced the president to groups of Soviets clustered at one end of the cobblestone expanse and pointed out famed sights like Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s red marble mausoleum and St. Basil's Cathedral Stealing the limelight from the man known as the Great Communicator, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gingerly took a little boy into his arms and motioned to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to get acquainted with the young Soviet, while cameras whirred and captured the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> chief in a congenial pose. Later, at an unscheduled stop in Cathedral Square, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> shook hands with Soviet and American tourists and gave an impromptu interview to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON>, whose crew was filming nearby. At the signing ceremony, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> entered the Red Salon of the Grand Kremlin Palace with a wave and a greeting for journalists. After the session he returned to an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter who had asked a question during his entrance. `` What was it you wanted to ask?'' he said. The party chief then recapped his morning meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, saying it was spent tackling economic problems and barriers to broader cultural ties. `` I criticized the position of the president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for having thrown up a great deal of logjams in the way of healthy economic cooperation,'' he said, adding that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had agreed with him that improvements are in order. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who is 20 years <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s senior, appeared fatigued on the third day of his meetings with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and declined to answer questions about the results of his talks. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president had slept fitfully and was tiring, like the rest of his staff. In the afternoon, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with Soviet writers, addressed students and faculty members at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and presided over a state dinner in honor of the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence. But during the events that pit the two leaders together, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has emerged as the more vibrant figure. That image, combined with any specific achievements that could come out of the summit, could propel him into a more secure position going into an important party gathering on June 28. Soviet government spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> commented last week that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would have to divide his time during the summit between the affairs of state and the pressures of an approaching party conference that will pass judgment on `` perestroika,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform program. The conference could prove explosive, as some of the 5,000 delegates are believed to share <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> ideology chief <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s view that changes are being introduced too quickly. Hosting the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> at broadly publicized events like Monday night's state dinner and showing them around a spruced-up Soviet capital has apparently impressed the populace and strenthened their pride in their nation. The 57-year-old <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been more accessible to Western reporters than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and the Soviet assessment of how the summit is progressing trickles out through a battery of Soviet briefings for the thousands of reporters covering <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit. The usually bureaucratic Soviet business world has taken a cue from the leader, showing unusual attentiveness to the needs of the press and officials. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency published the state dinner menu in English and has distributed unusually detailed historical reports on summit venues like <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>'s Hall and <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Managers of the International Hotel housing the summit press center have made rounds of some offices to ensure that the air-conditioning works and that waste baskets are emptied. As part of the public relations drive, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> planned to give a press conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> press center on Wednesday afternoon, the first-ever event here that approximates a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential press conference. He has met with reporters during his three previous summits with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and during visits to other major countries. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> bristled at a question about Soviet political prisoners during his first full news conference in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, but has since shown himself to be adept at handling the range of queries thrown out to him by Western reporters. His first session in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will give him a chance to set out his views of how the summit turned out, and to portray himself as a victor on the foreign affairs front as he heads toward the domestic debate of the party conference.

 Two prominent Soviet political commentators on Tuesday disputed former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Communist Party boss <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s claim that the Kremlin's No. 2 official is blocking economic and social reforms. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, in an unprecedented public airing of high-level <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> disagreement, told the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a television interview Monday that <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> should resign. <PERSON> Feodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON>, a former member of the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who writes for the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> would face severe punishment if he were a true opponent of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. `` If <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> has his own views, it is only natural. It is another thing to lead some conservatives, and I think this is not a fact. ... I do n't think that anybody leads some opposition. It is just impossible in our political system. If such a person appears on the political scene, he would be out of the leadership,'' <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION> and International Relations, said he disagreed with <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> that <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> is blocking reform. `` I also can express my opinion and I do not agree with Mr. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>. Those opinions are those of Mr. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON> said in an interview. The 67-year-old <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, who oversees <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ideology, has indicated in speeches he feels <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or open discussion of the country's problems, has gone too far in denouncing most of the economic and social policies of the past. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said in the interview that <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> should go `` because the party is still lagging behind, because the process of democratization in the party is not developing ... and <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> is the main person responsible for this.'' <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, took issue with <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> on another point _ his decision to give the interview to the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>, as well as one to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` In our point of view I do n't think it was too correct for him to do it, but that is my personal opinion,'' he told a news conference. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, 57, was removed Feb. 18 as a candidate, or non-voting, member of the ruling Politburo. His problems began when he made a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 21, 1987 in which he said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms were going to slowly and attacked <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>. On Nov. 11, the <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had fired <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>. At the time, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> of using immature words and of radical actions and said he `` placed his personal ambitions above the interests of the party.'' Removed from the Politburo, he was named to the Cabinet-level position of deputy head of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He lost his job on the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal legislature, on May 4 As <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> stood out for his brusque, aggressive manner and populist style. He was popular among Muscovites for criticizing consumer shortages and sometimes striding into stores to take his complaints straight to shopkeepers. Rumors circulated in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in mid-April that <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had a bitter face-off, with <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> reportedly backing a newspaper article defending the late dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> supposedly counterattacking through another article pushing radical reforms. The two have made several public appearances together since then, with no obvious sign of disagreements.

 A teen-ager killed six people with an ax, including four of his relatives, before he fell to his death into a ditch while fleeing a village mob, newspapers reported Tuesday. The killings occurred May 26 in the remote village of <LOCATION> Linjoka </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, but the incident was not reported until Tuesday. <LOCATION> Linjoka </LOCATION> is 135 miles north of <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s capital.

 <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> enshrined the tiger swallowtail and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> embraced the allosaurus, but no such warm welcome awaited the banana slug in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> or the monarch butterfly in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The fate of these and other creatures was debated in legislatures across the nation this year, part of the time-honored custom of naming official state symbols for everything from fish to fossils, from mollusks to muffins. Critics say the practice wastes time and holds lawmakers up to ridicule, but defenders say it can help get young people involved in the political process, boost tourism, and provide some beneficial comic relief. `` It gets so tense in there sometimes. It's just too much,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderlinde </PERSON> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, where this year's <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> designated the triceratops, a plant-eating dinosaur, as the state fossil and <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> gold as the state jewelry `` This livens it up, and then people will relax and get back to work,'' she said. After the gold measure was passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in January, lawmakers adopted a second resolution naming Vanderlinde the state's official jewel because she takes gold shots for arthritis. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> adopted a fossil this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Hagerman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fossil </ORGANIZATION>, a 3 -LCB- - million-year-old relic found in southern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Magic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> State and local officials are trying to turn the fossil beds south of Interstate 84 into a tourist attraction to boost the economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted in April to name the Key lime pie the official state pie, inspired by a legislative report that recommended the honor as `` an excellent way to promote a genuine <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> product, since the pie can only be properly made with Key limes from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.'' However, the measure ran into trouble in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where Rules Chairman <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> favors sweet potato pie more common to the Panhandle. On Thursday, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> nearly squashed a measure to name the banana slug the official mollusk, but narrowly decided to allow the proposal to be reconsidered in the future. `` These things are replusive, I mean look at them ... The joke has to stop here,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON>, as banana slugs oozed around inside a glass terrarium on a cart parked on the floor of the upper house. In some other actions so far this year, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> designated the tiger swallowtail the state butterfly, but the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> refused to act on a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure naming the monarch butterfly the state insect. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> made the allosaurus the state fossil, and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> approved making the nene, a native goose, the state bird, and the Hibiscus the state flower. Last month in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee named a long-extinct aquatic creature _ phacops rana _ the state fossil after 100 Bucks County schoolchildren trooped into the committee room and performed skits and gave speeches supporting the appellation. At one point, the committee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, donned a scarf and sunglasses and held an umbrella to show the children how fossils are formed over millions of years. `` There's certainly some time consumed in this, but if you're involving a bunch of youngsters in the process ... maybe there's nothing wrong with it,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> MacNett </PERSON>, chief counsel for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` I guess it depends on how long it takes and when on the legislative agenda it occurs.'' That attitude was not encouraged this year in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mannweiler </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President Pro Tem <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garton </PERSON> warned lawmakers not to introduce frivolous bills for the biennial short session. `` It creates the wrong image for the Legislature,'' said <PERSON> Garton </PERSON>. `` It's a frivolous image. It creates the image that that's all we do, and it detracts from the serious business.'' <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>, editor with the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governments </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, defended the practice of naming symbols. `` It's not something that takes up a great deal of attention or time,'' she said. `` I do n't think anybody expects every minute to be taken up with something serious. Maybe it's more harmless than raising taxes.''

<HEAD>Sales of New Homes at Year-High Level</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New-home sales climbed 4 percent in April to the highest level in a year, the government said Tuesday, but analysts said rising interest rates would likely dampen sales this summer. New single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 679,000 last month, the fastest pace since new homes sold at a rate of 728,000 in April 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> departments said in a joint report. It was the third consecutive increase, coming atop a 1.2 percent rise in March and an 11.4 percent jump in February. `` Overall, it's a very nice report. No question about it,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>. A survey of home builders showed sales remained strong in early May, he said. `` But clearly our concern is what's been going on with interest rates,'' <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON> said. `` ... If rates move much higher, certainly sales are going to be coming down. Our forecast is for sales activity to peak in the second quarter.'' Rates on 30-year, fixed-rate conventional mortgages have been climbing steadily since late March, averaging 10.58 percent last week, up from the low this year of 9.84 percent, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasko </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said sales could be helped in May by purchasers hoping to beat out further increases `` But by June, the bloom will be off the rose and we're going see sales trailing off,'' he said. However, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, said higher rates, rather than chasing buyers from the market, may simply cause them to switch to adjustable rate mortgages. `` We've proved over and over again that adjustable rate mortgages provide a reasonable alternative to fixed rates. Even though both rates are moving up, you still have adjustables in what has to be considered very affordable ranges,'' he said. More worrisome, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> said, is the increase in new home prices. The median, or midpoint, price of a new home was $ 110,500 in April, up 3.3 percent from March and 14.5 percent from a year ago. The average price of a new home was $ 137,000, up 4.2 percent from March and 16 percent over the past year. The recent increases in sales followed declines in the three previous months: 1.2 percent in January, 6.2 percent in December and 4.3 percent in November. Economists attributed them to buyers' uncertainty following the October stock market crash Sales for the first four months of this year are 9.3 percent below the same period of 1987, when mortgage interest rates hit nine-year lows. There were 671,000 new homes sold in 1987 and 750,000 sold in 1986, a record. Analysts are predicting sales in the 620,000-650 ,000 range this year Sales increased in all regions of the country in April. They were up 5.9 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, 5.5 percent in the West, 2.9 percent in the South and 2.8 percent in the Northeast. In a report last week, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said sales of existing homes increased 4.5 percent in April after increases of 2.5 percent in both March and February.

 Americans are broadly dissatisfied with the presidential nominating system, with majorities backing major changes such as eliminating party conventions, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll has found. Six in 10 respondents in the national survey said they have not followed the campaign regularly, only half said the races provide a good discussion of the issues and sizable minorities said the best candidates generally lose. As the primary season winds down, with the final contests to be held June 7, the survey of 1,204 adults found unhappiness with the process that spanned ideolgies and political affiliations. Fifty-two percent of those polled favored major changes in the way the parties pick candidates, while only 38 percent said the system works well enough as it is. Ten percent said they did n't know There was a striking split among age groups: The youngest, 18-29, thought by a narrow margin that the system works well enough as it is, while the oldest, over 64, favored major changes by a wide 56-28 percent spread. Similarly, attentiveness to the races was divided by age, with just 27 percent of the youngest group saying they followed this year's primaries regularly, compared with 54 percent of the oldest group. Overall, 41 percent of the respondents said they followed the campaign regularly. Just 31 percent favored the current nominating system. Rules vary by state, but generally voters select some delegates, the party selects others and the delegates meet to choose the nominee at party conventions, where under some circumstances delegates can switch allegiance. A majority in the poll, 59 percent, said they would prefer to have voters select the nominees, without any delegates at party conventions. The smallest share, a scant 3 percent, liked the idea of letting party leaders make the selection on their own. Disfavor with the system also was reflected by the sizable minorities of Americans who said the parties, particularly Democrats, generally do not nominate their best candidate from among those running. While 46 percent of respondents said the Democrats generally do pick their best candidate, 40 percent said not. A majority of women said the best is nominated, but a plurality of men _ 47 percent to 41 percent _ said not. More respondents overall, 52 percent, said the Republicans nominate their best candidate from among those running, but more than a third said not. Democrats were more likely to be happy with their nominee and Republicans with theirs. But even the Democratic respondents said the Republicans make their best choice, 51-38, while Republicans were split on whether the Democrats make their best pick, 42 percent saying yes and 44 percent no. Independents said the Republicans choose well, 48-35, but also were split on the Democrats. When it comes to choosing vice presidential candidates, a large marjority favored leaving the choice to the presidential nominee, while less than a quarter said the second-place finisher should be the running mate. While 51 percent said the nomination campaigns usually provide a good discussion of the issues, 40 percent disagreed, and college graduates and higher-income Americans were split on the question. In what may be a reflection of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s efforts as a candidate for the Democratic nomination, a greater share of blacks, 64 percent, said the campaigns provide a good discussion of the issues. Also, 55 percent of Southerners said the campaigns provide a good discussion, belying criticism of the Super Tuesday regional primary as a superficial media event. A plurality of all respondents and a majority of Southerners said Super Tuesday was a good idea, and 54 percent of the respondents said regional primaries should be held in the future. While 41 percent of those polled said they have been following this year's primary campaigns regularly, 50 percent said they paid occasional attention and 9 percent said they followed the primaries hardly at all or not at all. The Media General-Associated Press poll consisted of telephone interviews April 29-May 8 with a randomly selected sample of 1,204 adults across the nation. The margin of error was plus or minus three percentage points. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the Tampa -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION> -RRB-.

The phone numbers were selected randomly by computer, and interviews were conducted with the adult in the household who had the most recent birthday. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning the results theoretically would be within three points of the same 19 times out of 20 if every adult American were asked the same questions. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ six points for the 18-29 age group, for example, and seven points for those over 64. There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and responses in this poll: 1. The Republicans and Democrats use state primaries and caucuses and nominating conventions to select their presidential candidates. Do you think the system works well enough as it is, or does it need major changes? Well enough, 38 percent. Major changes, 52 percent. Do n't know or no answer, 10 percent. 2. Please tell me which of these statements most closely represents your view: a. Presidential candidates should be selected through primaries and caucuses followed by conventions. b. Presidential candidates should be selected by the voters without any delegates or conventions. c. Presidential candidates should be selected by party leaders at the conventions without any primaries and caucuses. Primaries, caucuses and conventions, 31 percent. Voters only, 59 percent. Party leaders only, 3 percent. Do n't know or no answer, 7 percent. 3. This year for the first time, 14 Southern or border states voted on the same day, Tuesday, March 8. Do you think the regional primary called Super Tuesday was a good idea? Yes, 48 percent. No, 27 percent. Do n't know or no answer, 25 percent. 4. Do you think regional primaries should be held in the future? Yes, 54 percent. No, 25 percent. Do n't know or no answer, 21 percent. 5. Generally, do you think the second-place finisher in the nomination campaign should be the vice-presidential nominee, or should the presidential nominee select whomever he or she wants? Second-place, 24 percent. Whomever, 69 percent. Do n't know or no answer, 7 percent. 6. From among those who run for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nomination for president, do you think the Democrats generally nominate their best candidate? Yes, 46 percent. No, 40 percent. Do n't know or no answer, 14 percent. 7.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Frum </PERSON> remembers running uphill from the Johnstown Flood of 1889, which swept everything in its path, killing 2,200 people in one of the nation's worst natural disasters. `` It was just like a roar. There were millions of gallons of water, you know,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Frum </PERSON>, 105, said Tuesday. `` It came just like a tidal wave and then it was over. Everything was washed away. We ran. If we did n't run, I would n't be here today.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Frum </PERSON> was 6 when the South Fork Dam burst and a 40-foot wall of water and debris slammed into this western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> steel and railroad city 12 miles downstream. She and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomo </PERSON>, 99, of <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, are the two remaining survivors of the May 31, 1889, disaster. They were to be guests of honor at the annual Flood Survivors' Banquet on Tuesday night. The dam held back <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Conemaugh </LOCATION> and was owned by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hunting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, a summer playground for wealthy industrialists led by <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Frick </PERSON>. After several days of rain, the poorly maintained dam was breached and finally burst, unleashing a torrent of water that cleared the <LOCATION> Conemaugh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> valley of houses, bridges and trains before it hit <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION>. Pushing ahead uprooted trees, splintered beams, dead and dying people and farm animals, and miles of wire from a destroyed steel mill, the watery mass crashed into a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Railroad bridge just below <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION>, where it piled up to form a temporary second dam that soon caught fire. Many bodies never were found. When she was a child, Mrs. <PERSON> Frum </PERSON>'s family lived in nearby <LOCATION> Conemaugh </LOCATION>. As the water approached, her father grabbed his wife and three daughters and started them running up a hill. The floodwater passed below. `` It happened and then it was over,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Frum </PERSON> recalled. `` After that, it was calm like nothing happened.'' <PERSON> Shomo </PERSON>, only 100 days old when the dam burst, lived about 20 miles downriver from <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Lockport </LOCATION>. He said the high water did not reach his house. Mrs. <PERSON> Frum </PERSON> survived another flood in 1936, stranded on the second floor of her <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION> house. By the area's third flood disaster, in 1977, Mrs. <PERSON> Frum </PERSON> was living high and dry on a mountain in nearby Southmont.

<TEXT>
 Officials fired a rocket motor from a Pershing 2 missile on the high plains east of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> on Tuesday, hoping to determine whether hundreds of the motors can be safely destroyed as required by a new U.S.-Soviet treaty. The burn, following 11 days of delays because of bad weather, came on the final day open for such test firings under the U.S.-Sov-Range Nuclear Forces treaty. `` From our initial indication, the burn, the static firing, was conducted just as we had planned. And the plume _ the exhaust cloud _ traveled with the wind over the -LRB- 50 -RRB- monitoring sites,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pueblo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actiiet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediatevity </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> monitors will analyze the exhaust to see whether such firings would pose any threat to the environment. About 20 reporters and photographers witnessed the 58-second test at 6:36 a.m. at the depot 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, officials said. `` There was a steady, bright white light from the end of the rocket nozzle extending approximately 75-80 feet,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. The weapons treaty was ratified last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and copies were scheduled to be exchanged Wednesday at the summit meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> between Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The treaty requires that the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 420 Pershing missiles be destroyednal <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> superintendents were invited to attend the four-day gathering in Grand Teton National Park. The meeting, the first of its kind in 12 years, was called by <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> in early 1987, but he left most of the planning and agenda to a committee of superintendents. `` The program was turned over entirely to the superintendents and they chose subject matter which focuses on current issues, both internal and external, facing the parks today,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Berklacy </PERSON>, chief of public affairs for the park service. `` This is not a regional or headquarters agenda, this conference is by and for the superintendents.'' <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Destry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based nonprofit citizens group, praised the park service for holding the superintendents' conclave. `` I think it is a very serious, professional thing that they have done,'' said <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, who planned to attend as an observer. `` I think it's very important that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> enhance the notion that this is a single service, with a single purpose. I'm sure they will get a lot of business done that would not occur if they were n't together.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> said the meeting `` is in the best interest of the country. They -LRB- the superintendents -RRB- should n't wait another decade for another one.'' Last week the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> issued a report calling on the federal government to move all hotels and other concessions out of the national parks and describing some parks as endangered. The <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s assessment was just the latest in a continuing controversy over what's best for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s officially preserved natural heritage. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> recently issued a report recommending a $ 50 million annual increase in the park service's budget just to fix a resource management backlog of problems. In 1980, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> itself issued a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the `` State of the Parks.'' In that summary more than 4,000 individual threats were identified.

<HEAD>Program Turns Out Too Many Male Sea Turtles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A program used in some areas to hatch endangered sea turtles is turning out too many males and must be changed, naturalists say. From May to November, loggerhead and green sea turtles lay eggs on the beach and abandon them. Eggs buried in cooler sand hatch as males and in warmer as females, said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Huff </PERSON>, who heads the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> turtle protection program. But some of those nests are dug up by scientists and hatched in incubators to gurarantee a higher survival rate. Until recently, eggs gathered up in the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> here and in some other locations around <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> have been incubated in styrofoam chests. Young turtles do not show their gender externally, however, and scientists were unsure how many hatchlings were male. But a study of 1986 hatchlings which involved a painstaking surgical procedure has confirmed what some had suspected _ most of the turtles from the chests are male. To solve the problem, the naturalists are switching to burial of the turtles in beach sand, but with a cage surrounding them to ward off predators, as some other <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> hatcheries do. The cages are placed near the shore to make the hatchlings' run from their nest to the sea as short as possible. `` We do n't know all the implications, and are just being conservative and encouraging people to use beach hatcheries whenever possible,'' said <PERSON> Huff </PERSON>. Incubating the eggs in boxes will now be the choice of last resort, he said. The unbalanced sex ratio is not considered serious yet because only about 10 percent of the turtle nests are dug up and incubated artificially, he said. `` We take so few compared to the worldwide population, it's unlikely we'd ever affect the wild population,'' he said But the aim of the turtle program is to simulate nature as nearly as possible, he added.

<HEAD>Man Arrested After Climbing Into Tiger Enclosure at Zoo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police seized a shirtless man who climbed atop a zoo exhibit where a worker was mauled to death last month, thumped his chest and traded growls with two agitated <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> tigers. The incident, which occurred before about 100 Memorial Day spectators, came a day after two of the zoo's 15 tigers were returned to view for the first time since the May 12 mauling of keeper <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavoie </PERSON>, 27, was charged with criminal trespass and jailed in lieu of a $ 1,000 bond, police said Tuesday. He was not injured. `` He was making a Tarzan call down to the tigers. He was really aggravating the animals,'' said witness <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaetgens </PERSON>, who videotaped the incident. `` I thought he was going to fall. I sent my wife away.'' The episode underscored recent employee complaints about lax safety. <PERSON> Lavoie </PERSON> apparently gained access to a walkway over the tiger display through a fallen, unmarked gate while a guard was at lunch. Zoo officials, who ordered an investigation of safety procedures after <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON>'s death, said Monday's incident is not indicative of lax procedures. `` There is no way we can protect anyone from their own irrational acts,'' said zoo curator <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Herwig </PERSON>. But zoo employees have complained that the zoo's design and management put them and the public in jeopardy. Chief among their concerns is working alone with dangerous animals because of staffing shortages. Moments before <PERSON> Lavoie </PERSON> appeared atop the 12-inch-wide wall behind the rocks, he was lingering outside the fallen gate. The gate was erected as a temporary measure about two years ago, <PERSON> Herwig </PERSON> said. `` The walkway was intended as an overview for the cat facility,'' he said. `` It was never opened because it would be impossible to prevent an incident such as this.'' He said he did not know how long the gate was broken, but Zoo Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Werler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lavoie </PERSON> was the first unauthorized person to have gone past the barrier and into the exhibit.

She was not authorized to disclose the name of the American reportedly detained. Ham radio operators who picked up a distress call said the skipper identified the yacht as the <ORGANIZATION> Satori </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The incident was alleged to have taken place Monday night 20 miles off <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. The skipper, whose name sounds like `` <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>,'' radioed that he had been rammed and that one large gunboat was a quarter-mile off his bow and a smaller gunboat was 100 feet off his stern, preventing his escape, said a <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> ham radio operator who spoke only on condition he not be named. The distress call said the vessel was taking on water as a result of being rammed, but was not in danger of sinking, the ham operator said. The Satori reportedly was en route from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>.

 Critics are praising the adventurous spirit of this year's <ORGANIZATION> Spoleto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> of the performing arts, even if some productions have n't emerged unscathed from reviewers' pens. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> `` has often been daring, but this year seems to be more so than usual.'' Everywhere at this year's festival `` there is something beguiling and new _ or so ancient it's just as challenging,'' said <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>. The main opera at the festival which continues through Sunday is <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON>'s `` Rusalka,'' a work which is rarely performed in this country. <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> also features the seldom-performed `` Montezuma'' by <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Graun </PERSON> and saw the premiere of a controversial dancer-theater piece by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> choreographer <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>. The Post called the <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> production of `` Rusalka'' `` one of the most effective in the festival's 12-year American history.'' But The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said the staging and special effects are the real highlights of the opera based on a Czechoslovakian fairy tale about a water sprite. `` Though the singers involved were mostly good second-and third-level professionals, the principal strengths of this staging, at least for two of the three acts, were visual,'' the Times reviewer said. `` Striking stage pictures came and went, compensating to an extent for a lack of vocal excitement.'' The State said the production `` is not to be missed by opera-lovers. <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION>'s staging may be the only opportunity to see this sadly neglected opera in a lifetime,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said. `` Montezuma,'' which tells of the Spanish destruction of the Aztec civilization in the 1500s, is performed even less frequently and has n't fared well with the <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> critics. The News and Courier of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> called the cast `` spotty'' and suggested `` it is not an opera for all to enjoy.'' `` It did manage to give a taste of ` Montezuma' however, albeit with a merely serviceable abstract decor and conducting and singing that was mostly insensitive and inauthentic to the period, `` wrote The Wall Street Journal. USA Today called Ms. <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>'s `` Miracolo D'Amore'' `` a delicious little scandal'' for the festival. The work, which conjures sometimes violent images of love, features some nudity and has caused a stir among <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> audiences. A number of people have walked out of the historic Dock Street Theater before the end of the performances. `` Viewed with a calm, receptive eye, ` Miracolo d'Amore' is a profoundly impressive, tight, lucid piece,'' said <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>. `` The naked women evoke <PERSON> Botticelli </PERSON>, and the lyrics and minuscule amount of text are all in Italian, making for a rather remote experience if you do n't get the references,'' The Wall Street Journal said. `` It's either a dream or a bore, depending on whom you ask.'' One reviewer for The News and <PERSON> Courier </PERSON> called the work `` unsettling'' and described it as `` a hateful piece, bitter and malevolent. As a theater work it's visually beautiful. But then, so is a coral snake.'' Another reviewer for the paper suggested `` this is clearly a work of _ dare I say it? _ feminist revenge.'' The reviewer added Ms. <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> `` has wrought a theatrical experience that will affect different people in radically, one might say almost violently, different ways.'' Composer <PERSON> Gian </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Menotti </PERSON> founded the Festival of the Two Worlds in <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, in 1958, and later founded the <ORGANIZATION> Spoleto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> Festival of the Three Worlds in <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. He still heads all of them.

<HEAD>Solidarity Says It Will Boycott June 19 Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Solidarity trade union federation announced Tuesday it is boycotting nationwide elections June 19 for local and provincial councils. `` The boycott will be an expression of our resistance to the deprivation of our rights. It will be an expression on striving for regaining of social sovereignty,'' Solidarity's national executive commission said in a communique released by spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON>. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said earlier that the government was prepared for opponents to mount a boycott. The vote will be the first held under a new election law that requires at least two candidates for each seat, secret ballots and allows various social groups to propose candidates. But the ballot continues to be structured in such a way that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is guaranteed a majority of the seats on the municipal and provincial councils. For most seats, only communist party candidates are nominated. Allied political parties and independents are also allotted a certain number of seats fixed beforehand by nominating commissions. Urban defended the arrangement at his weekly news conference Tuesday, saying the public will be able to show its preference for individuals although not for parties. But the statement by the outlawed Solidarity movement said any hopes that Poles would be able to elect candidates `` freely and democratically ... were in vain.'' `` Instead of returning to us our rights, we were offered participation in a show ... Disguising the old practice in which it is decided for the citizens who can represent them,'' Solidarity said. Solidarity initially had discussed trying to nominate candidates for the council elections, the first to be held in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since 1984. But the electoral law passed March 10 said only legal groups could propose candidates, and it left the final ballot composition in the hands of the electoral commissions dominated by the party. `` This electoral procedure gives us no chances in practice,'' said <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> regional Solidarity leader <PERSON> Zbygniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON>. But Urban said `` many representatives of independent communities were proposed to be candidates -LRB- and -RRB- most of them refused because, as they stated, the electoral procedure was n't democratic enough for them.'' He called it a `` vicious circle. ... They want more democracy but do n't want to take advantage of existing possibilities.'' Urban also said the government does not fear a boycott and would not, as in the past, interpret the eventual turnout figures as a barometer of public support for the government. `` Experience shows that these boycotts have minimal effect on electoral attendance,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s last nationwide election, the Nov. 29 referendum on government plans for economic and political reform, 67.3 percent of the 26.2 million eligible voters participated. It was the lowest announced turnout of any election in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s postwar history. Both referendum questions were approved by a majority of votes cast. But the low turnout prevented them from receiving approval by more than half all eligible voters, as required by law for the results to be legally binding.

<HEAD>W.R. Grace Pleads Guilty To Concealing Chemical Use From EPA</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which two years ago paid a reported $ 8 million for polluting wells in <LOCATION> Woburn </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty Tuesday to lying about the amount of a chemical it used at a plant there. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauro </PERSON> fined the New York-based conglomerate the maximum $ 10,000 for willfully misleading the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> about purchases of the cleaning solvent acetone. As part of an agreement, the government dropped a second charge that <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> concealed dumping of hazardous waste in the ground behind the plant in <LOCATION> Woburn </LOCATION>, where a group of families alleges that chemically tainted water caused six cancer deaths. `` I view this to be intolerable corporate behavior and the kind of behavior we will continue to pursue with the criminal remedies available to us,'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Regional Administrator <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deland </PERSON> said after the plea. <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> plans to require Grace to clean all contaminants at the <LOCATION> Woburn </LOCATION> plant under the federal Superfund cleanup act. In a separate civil suit filed by eight <LOCATION> Woburn </LOCATION> familes, a federal jury in September 1986 found W.R. Grace liable for polluting two town wells. The case was settled for a reported $ 8 million before a second trial could be held on whether the contamination caused the six leukemia deaths in the town about 15 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. In a two-count indictment in January 1987, W.R. Grace was accused of lying to the government about chemicals it used at the Cryovac plant near the wells, which were shut in 1979. The company asserted in a February 1982 letter to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> it had bought only one five-gallon drum of acetone in 1978 for the plant. The company said the acetone purchased was the only amount brought to <LOCATION> Woburn </LOCATION> in 22 years covered by an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> inquiry. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> told <PERSON> Tauro </PERSON> that from 1973 to 1976, <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> had bought 65 gallons of acetone and had used the solvent repeatedly in the 1960s and 1970s to clean paint spray guns and circuit boards at Cryovac, a food packaging machine shop. <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Popeo </PERSON> told the judge that no company officials were aware the reports to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> were inaccurate. `` While the company does not dispute that the statement was inaccurate, it vigorously disputes that it was intentionally so,'' <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. Acting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> said the maximum fine for a corporation filing false statements with the government was increased to $ 500,000 in 1984. Grace was levied the old fine because the crime was committed in 1982. Eight families filed suit in 1982 charging four parties with causing the hazardous waste contamination of the wells. They are: <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> tannery and <ORGANIZATION> Unifirst </ORGANIZATION>, a uniform supply company. <ORGANIZATION> Unifirst </ORGANIZATION> settled for $ 1 million in October 1985, before the original trial, and <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> settled halfway through the 1986 proceedings. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> dismissed the portion of the suit against <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> and the tannery and in January denied the families a new trial.

<HEAD>Rabin Meets with Arabs, Who Say He Has Nothing to Offer</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said Tuesday he has met with Palestinians in search of ways to end violence in the occupied lands, but Arabs involved said he had nothing to offer and that the rebellion will continue. The army said 207 Palestinians have been killed since riots began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. It is the first time army figures have exceeded those kept by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which put the death toll at 198. According to the army, soldiers shot 157 Arabs to death. The army said the rest died of other causes or that the circumstances of their deaths were being investigated. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and a Jewish settler also have been killed. <PERSON> Dedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, a left-wing member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, quoted a confidential government document as saying 5,133 Palestinians had been shot or injured. He quoted the document as saying that 10,000 Arabs were in jail and that half of them had been arrested before Dec. 8. He said one in every 80 residents of the occupied lands over age 16 was in custody. <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> said a high-ranking defense official blamed `` harassment and maltreatment by soldiers'' of Palestinians for continued unrest in the lands that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 war. He said the official, whom he would not identify further, commented in a meeting with a few legislators. The army said a soldier was convicted of manslaughter in the killing of an Arab, and a Palestinian human rights group demanded that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> close a new prison where <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> inmates were held in `` inhumane and illegal conditions.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio that he decided to meet with Arabs, including <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organiation </ORGANIZATION> supporters, because he was convinced Palestinians now realized that `` by stones and firebombs they can achieve nothing.'' He held two meetings in less than a week, including one on Monday, but had said nothing previously about their purpose. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said he would talk with Palestinians only after the violence stopped. Analysts said the meetings indicate <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> believes the rebellion is abating. `` I'm the one who represents the Israeli government to the population in the territories, and I think the time has come to talk with all sections, with all factions among the Palestinians,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` I intend to continue meeting with people who represent different ... points of view.'' Arabs who attended the meeting Monday said <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> offered nothing but frustration to people involved in the 6-month-old `` intefadeh,'' which means uprising in Arabic. <PERSON> Yassir </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, a physician from <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the defense minister told them the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace initiative had failed and <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> could expect no political movement before next June. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> did not say what he told the Palestinians, and his office merely confirmed the meeting took place. `` He told us the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plan has missed the train and the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit will be fruitless,'' <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> said in an interview. `` We are too small for the superpowers. They are too involved with important things.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> also told the group another diplomatic initiative could not begin until months after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> hold elections in November, he said. `` It was very frustrating,'' <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> said. `` This just means the intefadeh will be more prolonged and the people will have to suffer longer. `` The intefadeh is far from over or waning. The Palestinians wo n't stop the violence without realizing some political aspirations. This is what we told <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>. The people who are running things are willing to pay a lot of sacrifices.'' <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> businessman, said the Arabs gave <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> a list of requests for easing restrictions, releasing children from jail and ending `` collective punishment'' against entire towns or refugee camps for the actions of protesters. <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> `` made no promises. He said, ` If the intefadeh relaxes, we will relax. If it worsens, the measures will get worse.''' <PERSON> Yaacov </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamir </PERSON>, an Ethiopian immigrant, was the soldier convicted of manslaughter. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> said he shot the Palestinian on Jan. 10 from less than two feet away while talking with him. <PERSON> Tamir </PERSON> awaits sentencing. Law in the Service of Man, a human rights group founded by <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> lawyers, has demanded closure of the <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> detention center in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>, where about 3,000 Arabs are held. The group, affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jurists </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, said prisoners were held in eight large tents, deprived of adequate water and subjected to beatings and the desert's extreme temperatures.

<TEXT>
 The director of a fireworks production at which a shell exploded, injuring 27 people, said Tuesday he can account for all the shells that were fired and the exploding one may have come from somewhere else. `` We have n't been able to substantiate that,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, who heads the arson abatement investigating the Sunday evening accident during the annual Dayton River Festival. Thirteen people remained hospitalized, all but one in good or fair condtion. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, was in serious condition. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leibert </PERSON>, producer for <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fireworks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ensemble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>, believes the shell that exploded came from somewhere other than the launch area, about 600 feet from the bank of the <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> where it hit. The shells, which normally travel 350 to 500 feet in the air before exploding, are fired off electrically. All 1,500, ranging from 3 to 13 inches in diameter, were sequenced and timed according to a script, <PERSON> Leibert </PERSON> said. `` When we looked at the videotape, the bursts were all in the sky where they should be when they were supposed to be,'' he said. <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, who said investigators had about 40 more witnesses to interview, said an inspection of the site yielded little conclusive information. `` We found a lot of debris along on the bank, and some of the markings were not of the type that the show uses,'' he said. `` Yet we did n't have any odor of gunpowder on it'' which would indicate a recently fired shell, he said. He said it would be several days before anything conclusive can be released. `` Most people were looking at the sky and were n't paying any attention. We'll get lucky if we find two of three people that saw something that do n't have a claim in this,'' <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fireworks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, which supplied the shells and the necessary state and federal licenses, carried the $ 1 million umbrella insurance policy required by the city, <PERSON> Leibert </PERSON> said. Fire Chief <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said the shell appeared to explode twice. <PERSON> Leibert </PERSON> said his show did not use any `` double-banger'' shells. Any drifting debris from the launching site also should have been pushed away from the accident scene by the prevailing winds, he said. <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> said that if the shell had come from the launch site, it must have come out of a launch tube, turned sharply right and skimmed 15 or 20 feet above the ground until hitting the bank. <PERSON> Leibert </PERSON> said the ensemble's most recent show was for the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION> weekend in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> and its next show would be the July 4 celebration in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Traffic accidents claimed the lives of at least 385 people on the nation's roads during the three-day Memorial Day weekend, authorities said Tuesday. Based on `` the past trends of the Memorial Day holiday period,'' the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had projected 380 to 480 people would die in traffic accidents, said council spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Carraro </PERSON>. The preliminary total late Tuesday morning `` is right around the normal'' for a non-holiday, three-day weekend, Ms. <PERSON> Carraro </PERSON> said. Generally, she said, more people die in accidents on holiday weekends because automobiles carry more people. The three-day holiday period began at 6 p.m. Friday, local time, and ended at midnight Monday. During last year's Memorial Day weekend, 416 people died in traffic accidents, the Chicago-based council said. The worst Memorial Day traffic toll in the last quarter-century was recorded in 1968, when 629 people died. The lowest recorded toll, in 1982, was 341. About 390 traffic deaths on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> roadways would be projected for a non-holiday, three-day weekend this time of year, council statistics clerk <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> contended Tuesday that `` everything has been said'' about the flap over her astrology use in the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, but she let it be known she intends to tell her side of the story in her own time. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, on a summit sidetrip to this Baltic capital of the czars, dismissed reporters' repeated attempts to discuss the revelation that she has consulted astrologers to advise President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on his schedule. It was the first time reporters had the opportunity to question her closely about the flap that arose last month when former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> published his book, `` For the Record,'' revealing the first lady's secret. The former chief of staff painted an unflattering portrait of the first couple, describing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as an incurious, passive chief executive controlled by a manipulative wife and media-conscious staff. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> also made clear his bitterness at being replaced at the White House at the height of the Iran-Contra affair, contending he'd been ousted by a cabal controlled and initiated by the first lady. At first, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> refused to be drawn into any discussion of the matter, declaring, `` Everything has been said about that that needs to be said.'' At one point, she was asked whether the `` stars were wrong'' for providing an answer, and she gave the reporter a sharp, disgusted look. But when she was asked again whether she intended to write her own book about the flap, she responded, `` Could be,'' and laughed heartily. Queried whether she intended to go into detail in such a book, she borrowed a line from a <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> song to indicate that she was intent on telling her side of the story. `` My way,'' she said, pointing at herself and repeating sternly, `` My way.'' And will <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> be interested in what she had to say? The first lady laughed again heartily and shot back, `` Absolutely.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told Soviet university students Tuesday that maybe the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people made a mistake when they `` humored'' Indians by giving them reservations rather than integrating them into society. The head of the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Indian organization called the remarks insulting. `` Maybe we made a mistake'' in trying to maintain Indian cultures, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in answering questions at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Maybe we should not have humored them in that, wanting to stay in that kind of primitive lifestyle. Maybe we should have said, ` No, come join us. Be citizens along with the rest of us.''' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> misspoke. Indians are citizens. All American Indians were made full citizens by an act of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1924. It was n't until 1948 when court decisions gave them full voting rights in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in local and state elections. The 1980 census recorded 1.37 million Indians, of whom 332,000 were living on 260 reservations. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Suzan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shown </PERSON> <PERSON> Harjo </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Creek </PERSON> who is executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I was appalled by the president's performance but not surprised. ... He has headed the worst administration for <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> since the days of outright warfare and extermination ... `` I found particularly insulting his statement that perhaps the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not have ` humored them,' meaning us,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Harjo </PERSON>'s organization counts 3,500 individual members and tribes containing 850,000 members. Responding to a student's question, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he would be `` very happy'' to meet with three Indians who went to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> during the president's summit meeting with <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. They went under the sponsorship of the militant <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> to call attention to their grievances, among them hunger and lack of housing among Indians. The president has never met with Indian groups. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the Soviets that <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> `` from the beginning, announced that they wanted to maintain their way of life, as they had always lived there in the desert and the plains and so forth. And we set up these reservations so they could, and have a <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> to help take care of them.'' The president's remarks reflected decades-old oscillation in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward native Americans. The federal government has flip-flopped on whether Indians should be encouraged to maintain their culture or abandon it and join the mainstream. Current policy is to maintain Indian cultures, treating the tribes as sovereign governments in their own right. From 1887 to 1934, official policy was to try to turn Indians into self-sufficient farmers. Although <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s administration reversed the policy and originated the `` government-to-government'' idea, the <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> administration called for `` termination'' of tribes leading to assimilation of Indians in the larger culture Sixty tribes were dissolved, though about half of those have been revived. Presidents <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> reverted to a government-to-government policy, and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has reaffirmed it. By any standard, Indians are among the poorest of the poor, but off-reservation <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> appear to do better than those on reservations. The 1980 census found 12 percent of the nation's population living in poverty, but among Indians poverty was found in 22 percent of those living off reservations and 41 percent of those on reservations. Just this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> released a report documenting performance on standard tests by pupils in the schools it runs. They do worse than 79 percent of the nation's pupils overall. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> audience some <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> `` became very wealthy because some of those reservations were overlaying great pools of oil. And you can get very rich pumping oil.'' Although some tribes distribute royalty revenue to members, others use the funds as tribal revenues. Tribal oil royalties soared with oil prices, rising from $ 18 million in 1973 to $ 147 million in 1982, but fell back to $ 81 million last year as prices receded. These figures do not include the <LOCATION> Osage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tribe </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, which manages its own lands and collects its own royalties _ by far the largest of any tribe. The 4,749-member tribe got $ 71 million, about $ 15,000 per tribal member, in 1981, when oil prices were peaking. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, president of the Denver-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` There are a few -LRB- Indians -RRB- who have done fairly well, but there are probably fewer than 100 Indians you could point to and say, ` They've got some wealth.' But that's not oil; that's their own hard work.'' <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, a Crow, said he got a check for $ 38 for oil royalties last year. <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>'s group tries to make sure Indians living off the reservation are n't forgotten or written out of federal legislation, and tries to help those Indians use state and local welfare agencies. There are practically no federal programs devoted to off-reservation Indians. Indians leave the reservation because of `` education, jobs and politics,'' <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said. `` Life can be very hard on a reservation if you're part of the ` Out' party.'' `` I'm a fan of the president, but the president is a little bit removed from the reality of American Indians,'' <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Striking Hyundai Worker Stabs Himself In Dispute Over Wages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A striking <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> worker tried to commit ritual suicide in <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> on Tuesday in a dispute over wage increases, and police were asked to free 11 <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> executives taken hostage by strikers in <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung-han </PERSON>, 28, was in critical condition at a hospital after plunging a knife into his abdomen before hundreds of colleagues at a plant in <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION>, an industrial city on the southeast coast. <PERSON> Yoon </PERSON> fell to the ground with blood gushing out of a deep cut in his abdomen, witnesses said. The worker took the action when he was asked by union leaders to stop a speech to striking workers at the plant owned by <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a major manufacturer of train cars, witnesses said. The company is a subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's leading automaker. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION>'s assembly line in <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> was shut down after more than 80 percent of union members voted for a strike to press their demand for wage increases, company officials said. About 20,000 <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> workers halted production Monday and walked out in the salary dispute, the officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> workers demanded wage increases of up to $ 177. The company offered an increase of $ 54. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> workers with five to six years of experience now earn about $ 821 a month, including bonuses and other allowances, the company said. On Friday, 2,000 workers at a <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> Precision plant in the southern city of <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION> held 11 company executives hostage in offices inside the plant, including chairman <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Mong-ku </PERSON> and president <PERSON> Yoo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ki-chul </PERSON>. After repeated efforts to free the executives, <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> officials on Tuesday asked police to intervene. The striking workers refused to back down and blocked all gates to the plant with containers and trucks. Police officials said they would `` wait until the last moment'' to solve the situation without using force. But one police officer said intervention was inevitable if the workers did not free the executives `` in a day or two.'' Police officials said they also needed to investigate an incident on Friday in which two <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> officials were beaten unconcious by striking workers as they tried to leave the plant in <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION>. One official remained in criticial condition at a hospital after brain surgery and the other was listed in serious condition with head injuries. Cabinet ministers met Tuesday to discuss the situation and said the government would deal sternly with those who broke the law. In another development, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government on Tuesday said it supported the right of South Korean demonstrators to express their opinions about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as long as their protests remain non-violent. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> was asked by reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to comment on recent anti-U.S. demonstrations in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` We support the right of free expression, of opinion. We certainly understand people's wanting to express themselves, but we strongly oppose the use of violence,'' she said. Radicals and students have held demonstrations in recent weeks demanding the removal of 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Thousands of students shouting `` Yankee go home!'' on Monday joined a <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> funeral procession for a dissident student who committed suicide. Police fired tear gas when students burned a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag, and a handful of students then threw firebombs at the police.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> expects to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination next week and then, skipping the traditional break after the final primaries, immediately begin his fall campaign with trips to more than a dozen states before the July convention. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides say the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor wants to broaden his exposure throughout the country. His trips will include states considered vital to his chances in the fall, including <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Republican strongholds in recent presidential elections. `` We want to spend a good part of June out there in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, traveling, telling people who <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is and why he would be a good president,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> hold the final primaries June 7. Five days later <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will attend a National Conference of Mayors convention in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. His schedule then calls for a swing through <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. At the end of June, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plans to visit several <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> states, including <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. He also plans another trip to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and other Western states in early July. The Democratic National Convention is July 18-21 in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has enough delegate votes for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination, plans campaigning in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> June 9-11 but is scheduled to spend the rest of June and all of July either in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> or at his summer home in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, a campaign spokeswoman said. During the six weeks between the final primaries and the Democratic convention, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also will have to select a running mate and plot convention strategy, in addition to his state duties. But aides say he can take care of business while traveling. <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairmen in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> said Tuesday they viewed early and frequent <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appearances in their states as vital to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's chances of winning them in November. `` I certainly think it is imperative that he start early because he is not really well known in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON>. `` He has a reasonable chance in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. I wholly agree with the strategy.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will attend the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democratic convention June 17-18, when more than 10,000 state delegates and alternates will be on hand. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> represented <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and claims the state as his home. But recent polls have shown <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> close behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ and leading the vice president in a hypothetical race with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his running mate. <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' fluent <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> has made him popular among Mexican-American voters, and he predicted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also would win overwhelming black support in the fall. To beat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will have to do well among working-class voters who are traditionally Democrats but who supported President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980 and 1984, <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> party chairman, was equally enthusiastic about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' fall chances in his state. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> primaries in March. `` I think it can make the difference in whether or not we win <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said of the planned <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> visit. He said the latest poll in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a slight lead over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. As in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the poll showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> winning if he picks a favorite son running mate, in this instance <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. In 1984, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and former Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> relaxed their campaign schedules between the final primaries and the conventions. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was an incumbent president and <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> also was well known. As for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' plan, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, who managed the <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> campaign, said, `` I think it's a very smart move for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to do that. It gives him a chance to work on his general election message. Being out there and being seen will go a long way.''

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An officer posed as a buyer of stolen art to set up a raid at a hotel Tuesday that recovered three stolen masterpieces worth up to $ 52 million, police said. The works by Dutch painters <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jongkind </PERSON> and the French artist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON> were recovered in a pre-dawn raid on the Pullman Hotel. Police spokesman <PERSON> Klaas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilting </PERSON> said they were about to be sold for 1.5 million West German marks -LRB- $ 1.14 million -RRB-. Burglars took the paintings, whose value has been estimated at up to $ 52 million, from <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Municipal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> on May 20. Police said they arrested three suspects, a 36-year-old seller and two prospective buyers aged 32 and 44. All are of Dutch nationality but were not identified further in keeping with standard police practice. Wilting would not reveal the undercover policeman's relationship with the other two alleged buyers or give other details of his role. He acknowledged, however, that the West German currency was provided by Dutch authorities. Dutch television said the undercover agent had rented the two hotel rooms used for the transaction. Recovered were `` Carnations,'' an 1888 work by <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>; the 1894 still life `` Bottle with Apples'' by <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON>, and an 1874 painting by <PERSON> Jongkind </PERSON>, `` The House of <LOCATION> Maitre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Billaud </LOCATION> in Nevers.'' The <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> was found inside the hotel and the other paintings were in a car outside, all wrapped in blankets, police said. Wilting said museum director <PERSON> Wim </PERSON> <PERSON> Beeren </PERSON> told him the <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON> had a small scratch but the other paintings were undamaged. During the past week, police received anonymous tips that `` buyers were being solicited abroad,'' Wilting said. `` We got hard evidence of that early this week, and that's when we decided to act.'' He would not say why the price was set in West German currency. Undercover agents _ `` pseudo-buyers'' as the police call them _ have appeared only recently as a tactic of Dutch authorities. Their use is controversial because of allegations of entrapment. Although Wilting said the alleged seller has a police record for burglary, there was no immediate word on whether he was believed to be involved in the theft. A ground-floor window was smashed before dawn to gain entry to the museum. The museum's 3,200 art works, primarily from the 19th and 20th centuries, have been guarded during the night only by an electronic alarm system since 1975, when guards were removed to save money. An electronic alarm at a private security firm sounded when the window was broken, but reports indicated authorities were not notified for up to 20 minutes. <PERSON> Beeren </PERSON>, the museum director, speculated after the burglary that the theft was commissioned by a private collector, since it would be very difficult to sell the paintings. He gave the value estimate of 100 million guilders, or $ 52 million, and said it was based on the record prices brought by <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> works at recent auctions. Last November a collector paid $ 53 million for `` Irises'' at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> auction, and eight months earlier <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Sunflowers'' went for $ 29.8 million at a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> auction Experts from the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> auction house <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s estimated the total value of the stolen paintings at only 21 million guilders -LRB- $ 11 million -RRB-, with the <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> worth $ 1.6-2 .1 million

<HEAD>New Protein `Zaps' Transplant-Attacking Cells</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new genetically engineered protein kills transplant-attacking cells in mice, suggesting it might someday eliminate the need for risky and costly anti-rejection drugs in transplant patients, researchers said Tuesday. They expect the protein to be introduced for some leukemia patients this fall and for human transplant patients in a year or so. The leukemia patients suffer from a form of the disease marked by an excess of transplant-attacking blood cells. `` This is not only more powerful, but it's far more selective'' than conventional anti-rejection treatment, said Dr. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Strom </PERSON>, director of clinical immunology at <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` This therapy only zaps the cells that are active -LRB- against the transplanted organ -RRB- at that time and does n't depress the -LRB- disease-fighting -RRB- immune system across the board,'' he said at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunsicker </PERSON>, the society's president, said the findings represent ` terribly important work.'' `` The hope is that you could get someone who needs a kidney transplant and put in whatever one you have available,'' <PERSON> Hunsicker </PERSON> said. `` Maybe -LRB- tissue -RRB- matching at that point would n't make a difference.'' Researchers have been working for nearly a decade on the new protein, a fusion of a portion of the diphtheria toxin, one of the deadliest known toxins, and the natural immune system protein interleukin-2. When the body's immune system is confronted with unfamiliar material such as bacteria or a transplanted organ, it fights back with a group of cells called T-cells. The foreign substances activate a small number of T-cells, which produce interleukin-2 receptors, points on the cell surface to which only interleukin-2 molecules will stick. Activation of these receptors leads to an immunological cascade that activates more harmful cells which then attack the transplanted organ, leading to rejection of the foreign tissue. To prevent this from happening, <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, chief of biomolecular medicine at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, isolated the part of the diphtheria toxin that binds it to other cells and replaced it with the binding portion of the interleukin-2 molecule. The result was a hybrid protein that seeks out and attaches to only those T-cells harmful to transplanted organs, and kills the T-cells with the toxin. `` The idea for this particular magic bullet is to use it right after the transplant,'' <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> said. Over the past year, the researchers have tested the fusion protein on mice that underwent heart transplants. Ten mice were injected with the protein immediately after transplantation and received no other anti-rejection therapy, said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkman </PERSON>, a transplant surgeon at <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's Hospital in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> The injections were administered daily for 10 days. Nine of the 10 mice appeared to retain their new hearts permanently without need for chronic therapy, <PERSON> Kirkman </PERSON> said. All the mice receiving the fusion protein fared better than those that received no treatment and those injected with only a fragment of the diphtheria toxin. `` We're encouraged. We like what we see,'' <PERSON> Kirkman </PERSON> said. When the dose was increased 100 times, some kidney abnormalities were noted, <PERSON> Kirkman </PERSON> said, but no side effects were noted at therapeutic levels. Cyclosporine, an anti-rejection drug approved for general use by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in 1983, suppresses the body's entire immune system and therefore enhances the risk of infection. Side effects include kidney failure, excessive hair growth and tremors. Cyclosporine also costs transplant patients $ 5,000 a year or more. Researchers plan to test the fusion protein on monkeys, then patients suffering from T-cell leukemia without any other hope. Trials on transplant patients will follow, pending <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval. In humans, it's likely the fusion protein will be accompanied by cyclosporine, <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> said. `` We have reason to think it will work well with cyclosporine in low doses,'' he said. `` So maybe a little bit of cyclosporine will go a long way with this toxin.'' Researchers said the fusion protein eventually may be used to treat autoimmune diseases, in which the body produces a disordered immunological response against itself. Such diseases include forms of diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. `` It's the promise for the future that's very exciting,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said.

 A holiday joy ride in an overcrowded aluminum boat turned to tragedy when six young women drowned about 30 yards from the short of a lake, along with a man who tried to rescue them. Funeral home officials who met with the families of the seven victims said they hoped to complete arrangements by Wednesday morning. <ORGANIZATION> Yalobusha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coroner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> True </ORGANIZATION> said Monday he had ruled the deaths accidental. `` There were several people that witnessed the accident,'' he said. `` It was one of those tragic things.'' The bodies were recovered in eight to 10 feet of water near the boat, True said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, 32, who was operating the 16-foot, flat-bottomed aluminum boat, said the occupants were on a slow `` joy ride,'' splashing water on each other when the accident occurred Monday afternoon. `` One girl leaned over when the boat was turning and some water started coming in the boat and everybody panicked,'' said <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, who admitted that the boat was overloaded. `` Everybody stood up and started moving around in the boat,'' said <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>. `` Then it turned over. They was just hollering ` Help. Help. Help.' Could n't none of them swim.'' `` There were about 35 or 40 people on the shore and I was saying, ` Somebody help us.' People on the shore kind of panicked. A couple people fainted,'' he said. True identified the victims as sisters <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 21, and <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 20; their cousin, <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 20; <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 21; <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, 19. <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Rounds </PERSON>, 41, died after swimming from the shore in an attempt to rescue the women, <ORGANIZATION> True </ORGANIZATION> said. Another boat passenger, <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pernell </PERSON>, who still clinging to the boat when he was rescued by a fisherman was reported in stable condition Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> Grenada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Witnesses told the <ORGANIZATION> Yalobusha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that the boat had traveled about 30 yards from the shore of 25-acre <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tillatoba </LOCATION> in rural, north-central <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> when the accident occurred. The group went to the lake for a fish fry and barbecue. The boat, according to Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, was powered by a 25-horsepower outboard motor and was designed to hold four or five people. True said no life jackets were on the boat, but <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said there were two, though neither was worn. Three of the girls, <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said, held hands when the boat overturned and were still holding hands when their bodies were recovered.

 An increase in the state sales tax from 5 percent to 6 percent is expected to pump $ 70.4 million into the state's hard-pressed treasury between now and July 1, 1989. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McKown </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retailers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said that, despite objections to the higher tax which was to take effect at midnight Tuesday, most people `` feel they have an obligation to participate and pay the bills of the state and this is one way of doing it.'' The tax increase was part of an elaborate compromise worked out among the governor and the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> as they battled over finances earlier this year, when the state was forced to borrow $ 80 million on a short-term basis to meet operating expenses. The compromise was approved during the March 22 one-day special session of the Legislature. The increased sales tax is expected to raise $ 5.4 million for the remaining month of this fiscal year and and an estimated $ 65 million during the fiscal year that starts July 1. It is due to expire on June 30, 1989, although some merchants have said they expect it to become permanent after the general election in November. The tax was included in a bill that allowed the governor to borrow $ 30 million from the state black lung fund for miners to meet a backlog in Medicaid payments for medical treatment for the poor. The sales tax is to be used in part for the payback on the loan money. <PERSON> McKown </PERSON> said the temporary tax will cause little inconvenience for the state's 25,000 to 30,000 retailers, who collect and send the tax to the state <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The state's border counties may see a temporary exodus of customers to other states, but <PERSON> McKown </PERSON> said he does not expect that to last long, if it even occurs. Surrounding <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> have a 5 percent sales tax; <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> has a 4 -LCB- percent tax rate. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> has called two more special legislative sessions to deal with finances. The second special session starts Wednesday and will cover all areas but education. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> has proposed a nickel-a-gallon gasoline tax increase to meet his proposed budget. The third special session will be dedicated to education, which takes up 72 percent of <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s proposed $ 1.46-billion budget. The governor has threatened to revive several taxes which failed passage in the Legislature previously. No date has been set for the third session.

 Anti-apartheid clergymen ended an unprecedented emergency conference Tuesday with a church service at which they called for intensified non-violent resistance to the government. `` We are determined we are going to obey God whatever the cost,'' said Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. `` We are on the march!'' he shouted as a mostly black audience of 1,200 people shouted, cheered and whistled. The 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner then removed symbolic gags from the mouths of black and white youths on the podium, took up a wooden cross and carried it back and forth down the center aisle of the <ORGANIZATION> Regina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>. The audience held hands and swayed together, singing `` We Shall Overcome.'' Participating church leaders said they would try to mobilize support for a three-day national protest planned next week by black trade unions. They also disclosed plans for a campaign seeking release of political prisoners, to start June 12 and end July 18 _ the 70th birthday of jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. The Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We are not trying to undermine authority or advocate anarchy. We are distinguishing between two different kinds of authority.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, mixed-race leader of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, said he wanted the convocation to adopt a stronger statement calling for more protests and direct confrontation with the government. `` I was hoping the convocation would ask for a personal commitment that not all church leaders are ready to make either in their personal capacities or on behalf of the churches,'' said <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>. `` It will take time. But we are moving away from a theology of protest to a life of protest, and resistance.'' <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> said there was division among the church leaders, the largest group in many years to gather to discuss action against white domination. He said the decision to support the national protest next week was significant but added that the church leaders had decided to form a committee to work out details of specific actions. During the convocation, workshops were held to discuss a range of anti-apartheid tactics, including `` non-cooperation and non-collaboration'' with the government. The agenda suggested that targets of civil disobedience could include tax payments, military service and racially oriented laws such as those mandating segregated residential areas. People attending the church service were asked to take these and other proposals back to their congregations for consideration. The convocation was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, which includes major Protestant denominations active in the fight for black rights. Also participating were the Roman Catholic Church and a number of independent African churches. Organizers said political conditions in the country have worsened since leading clergymen decided in early February to organize the convocation. They cited the effective bannings of 17 anti-apartheid organizations, the closure of two opposition newspapers, and pending legislation to restrict labor unions and opposition political groups.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expressed hope Tuesday that Pakistani President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> will follow his dismissal of the prime minister with prompt, free and fair elections. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s decision to fire Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> last weekend appeared to be within rules set by the Pakistani constitution. `` We note President <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s May 30th statement that there will be no reversion to martial law, and that basic freedoms, including speech, press and assembly, remain intact. We also note the president's statement on holding national elections. We hope that those elections will be held promptly, and that they will be free and fair,'' she said. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, who came to power in a coup in 1977, granted power to a civilian government three years ago, but the constitution permits the president to dismiss the government if he feels there has been a breakdown of law and order. The constitution provides for elections to be held within 90 days. Asked if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would send officials to monitor the elections, Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said, `` all that is very premature. I'm sure we'll be watching as the election process develops.'' <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s $ 645 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid for the current fiscal year puts it third on the list of nations receiving <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> assistance, behind only <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s country receives so much because it acts as a funnel for aid to U.S.-backed resistance forces in Afghan and provides a haven for more than two million refugees from the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> war. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the assistance would not be affected by the political developments in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> raced through the palaces of this czarist-built capital Tuesday, declaring the vast art collection at the Hermitage `` staggering'' but lamenting the `` monstrosities'' of modern-day high-rises that blocked the view of the famous skyline. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said she found the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people `` very warm and very open.'' But as for <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, `` Well, she's a ... everybody's different,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said with a shrug Tens of thousands of waving, smiling citizens clustered along the main thoroughfares, <LOCATION> Nevsky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Prospekts, as her two-dozen car motorcade slowed to take in the array of columed buildings, domed churches and wide squares and statues that adorn the imperial, inner city area. And as she admired the maze of boulevards and buildings, she lamented the `` monstrosities'' of modern-day high-rises erected on the edge of the city. `` Staggering, staggering, there's just too much to digest,'' the first lady exclaimed at the end of her five-hour tour of this city on the Baltic, founded by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> the Great in 1703 and embellished by czars and czarinas over the decades. Queried whether she had any more sympathy for communism after viewing the extravagent finery used by the imperial family before the revolution, she replied quickly, `` No.'' The outpouring of affection that surrounded Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appeared to be spontaneous. Officials had not released her route in advance and people lined the main streets to catch a glimpse of her. She appeared as a speck of yellow in the back of a large black limousine. Asked by American reporters during the flight here about her hand-holding with <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at earlier meetings this week, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, with a shrug of her shoulders, `` I do n't know. It just sort of happened.'' Although Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> declined to join Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tour, she arranged for <PERSON> Lidiya </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, the wife of Soviet President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, to accompany her. The first lady said she found Mrs. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> `` very nice, very friendly, very warm.'' But asked if she had the same reaction to her tours with Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> smiled, and sat silent 12 seconds pondering her answer. `` Well, she's a ... everybody's different,'' she finally said, evoking laughter from the reporters. When someone asked if Mrs. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> lectured as much as Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> joined in the uproarius laughter. `` Just between us?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked, turning to one reporter. `` How many viewers and readers do you have?'' After another long pause, she tried to drop the subject, pleading, `` I'm desperately trying to think!'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will get back together on Wednesday to view icons in the famous Tretyakhov Gallery in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> started her tour, as most foreign dignitaries do, by paying homage to the 650,000 Russians who starved to death during the 900 day siege of the city by the Nazi invaders in 1941. More than a million people died in the defense of the city during the war. In a solemn ritual, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> placed a bouquet of red carnations at the austere, dark stone Monument to the Heroic Defenders. From there she traveled to the <LOCATION> Hermitage </LOCATION>, whose art collection _ one of the most fabulous in the world _ was begun in 1764 by <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> the Great. With a lecturer from the museum whispering into her ear, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was whisked by masterpieces by <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON>, <PERSON> Caravaggio </PERSON>, and other Italian, Flemish, Spanish and French artists. `` Oh, so much to see!'' she exclaimed at one point, dramatically clapping both hands to her head. The Mrs. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, who had some trouble negotiating the many stairs and hectic schedule, was heard to observe of the American pace, `` So quick. They stand, they go ...'' Asked if she were tired, she said, `` Of course, I'm tired. I'm 77 years old. How could I not be tired?'' The final leg on Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tour was a trip by hydrofoil to <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> the Great's summer palace. She was accompanied by <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Likhachev </PERSON>, a famous Soviet specialist in early <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> literature who has backed the preservation of older buildings. As the boat passed a series of complexes of austere, high-rise apartment buildings, <PERSON> Likhachev </PERSON> commented that they were `` impersonal'' to which Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agreed. He mentioned that the buildings now blocked a view of the city ` s famous skyline. `` Progress does n't always mean something wonderful,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> observed, gesturing towards the buildings. `` But what are we going to do about those monstrosities?''

 An anonymous caller to a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> radio station on Tuesday said a newspaper editor was kidnapped to force the government to suspend the extradition of drug traffickers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We are The Extraditables,'' the man told <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Todelar </ORGANIZATION> in a reference to a group that identifies itself with Colombian drug traffickers that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has sought to extradite for prosecution. The man said he and his associates abducted <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> on Sunday in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>, who is also a <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, was kidnapped by four men carrying machine guns who shot and killed his bodyguard. The caller also said the kidnappers want to exchange <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> for <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, a reputed leader of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s so-called <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel who was convicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> was asked about the possibility of an exchange of <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> for <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>. `` We do n't deal. We do n't make concessions,'' she said. `` We deplore this act of violence, whether it emanates from the traffickers, the violent left or right ... We offer his family and friends our hope he will be released soon.'' However, a statement signed by `` The Extraditables'' denied the group was involved in the kidnapping. Reporters in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, who received the statement about five hours after the call to the radio station, said it appeared to be authentic, based on previous releases from the same group on other matters. The voice of the 69-year-old <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> was heard on the radio station Monday saying: `` Oh, Oh, I'm dying.'' His wife and daughter said the call should be taken seriously and they asked the kidnappers for more details. The family said it had received an anonymous call and issued a public appeal to the kidnappers for medical attention for <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>, saying a team of doctors was standing by and that his blood type is A positive. `` We demand that the government not extradite any more Colombians to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Furthermore, we do n't accept that our comrade <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is condemned to life imprisonment,'' the anonymous caller told the radio station. Another caller to the radio station, who said he was among the gunmen, said Monday that <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> had died from wounds sustained during his abduction. But the man who called the radio station Tuesday said <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>'s injuries in an arm and a foot were not serious. `` We have <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>, injured,'' the man said, adding that he had been taken Monday night by helicopter to <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, 250 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was convicted in May in federal court in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on charges that he smuggled 3.3 tons of cocaine from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. He was captured in a Colombian jungle and flown to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for trial. Relatives of <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>, who also is a former presidential candidate, say they were threatened earlier this year by the drug traffickers because of his intense anti-drug campaign in his newspaper <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Siglo </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Increase in Farm Prices Reported for May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prices farmers got for raw products in May averaged 3.1 percent over April levels and were 4.7 percent over their mark for the same month last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` Higher prices for hogs, oranges, soybeans and broilers were partially offset by lower prices for tomatoes, onions, milk and upland cotton,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in its preliminary report. May farm commodity prices averaged 134 percent of a 1977 base used for comparison, according to the preliminary figures. A year ago the index was 128. Hog prices climbed to their highest levels since October on average, while cattle rose to the top levels since May 1979. Soybeans marked the largest month-to month increase in more than four years, 58 cents a bushel, and broilers were 5.5 cents a pound over their April mark. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists, net cash income of farmers set a record of about $ 57 billion in 1987. This year's net _ the difference between cash receipts and cash expenses _ may be in the $ 50 billion - $ 55 billion range Consumer food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 4 percent this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987. Preliminary May figures, based mainly on mid-month averages, showed livestock and poultry prices up 2.7 percent from both April and May 1987. `` Higher prices for hogs, broilers and beef cattle more than offset lower prices for milk, eggs and calves,'' <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said. Crop prices overall were up 4.5 percent from April and 7.4 percent above the levels of a year ago. The price index for oil-bearing crops, which consist mainly of soybeans, was up 7.4 percent from the previous month and 26 percent above the May 1987 level. Prices paid to commercial vegetable growers decreased 12 percent from April's levels and 11 percent from last year. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> attributed most of the change to lower prices for tomatoes, onions and sweet corn. The report also said: Cattle averaged $ 70 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally, up from $ 69 in April and the $ 63 reported for May 1987. Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef. Hogs averaged $ 46.90 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 41.90 in March and $ 54.40 a year earlier. Corn, at $ 1.89 a bushel, was up from $ 1.88 in April and well over lastyear's mark of $ 1.66. Wheat prices at the farm, according to the preliminary figures, averaged $ 2.83 a bushel, up from $ 2.79 last month and $ 2.66 a year earlier. Rice averaged $ 8.27 per 100 pounds, down slightly from $ 8.33 last month but still far above the year-ago figure of $ 3.71. Soybeans were reported at $ 6.98 a bushel, compared with $ 6.40 last month and $ 5.20 in May 1987. Upland cotton averaged 56.4 cents a pounds, a decrease from 59.4 cents in April and 60 cents a year earlier. Eggs were 43.1 cents a dozen, down from 45.5 cents in April, and 49.3 cents in May 1987. Milk was reported at $ 11.75 per 100 pounds, an increase from $ 11.72 last month but a decrease from $ 12.37 a year earlier. Broilers were 33.5 cents a pound, up from 28 cents last month and 29.9 cents in May 1987.

 <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>, the reggae musician who claimed <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> stole his music, has filed notice he will appeal the verdict against him in his copyright lawsuit. Lawyer <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Tuesday he had filed a notice of appeal in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> because he had found new evidence <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> could have heard <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s song. He would not elaborate. <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>, 36, of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, claimed the chorus of <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s 1985 hit `` Just Another Night'' had been stolen from his 1979 song of the same title. The jury found that <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> could not have heard <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s song, which was released both in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and played on several small radio stations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1983. <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> said he copyrighted his song in 1983 because drummer <PERSON> Sly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON>, who played with <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> on the album, told him his song was `` being ripped off,'' according to trial testimony. <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> also played on his version. Alley claimed that <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> had earned as much as $ 6 million from the song. <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>, whose song was copyrighted in 1985, testified he had never heard <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s song. <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON>, who testified for <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>, said he could not remember playing on <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s recording and denied ever telling <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> the tune was being plagiarized. <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Parcher </PERSON>, said through his assistant that he would comment if an appeal actually was filed. A notice of appeal, which must be filed within 30 days of a verdict, does not mean an actual appeal would be filed.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Tuesday he's `` earned consideration'' to run as the Democrats' vice presidential candidate, though he continued his presidential campaign one week before the final primaries. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> for the state's June 7 primary, also spoke of possibly going directly to the floor of the Democratic National Convention in July to fight for platform planks or other issues he considers important. On Tuesday, in what was billed as a `` major urban policy speech,'' he also renewed his calls for equal rights and justice. `` Making <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> better is our challenge. Invest in the people. Reinvest in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. On the subject of the vice presidency, he was asked whether he would accept if he should receive an offer from <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to be the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's running mate <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s reply: `` I've earned consideration.'' Were he himself to win, he added, he would give the same consideration to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He declined to elaborate on his feelings about the No. 2 spot, saying only, `` I'll discuss that in more detail after June 7.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> must work together to defeat Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s all-but-certain nominee. `` We need each other. We're keenly aware of that. Together, we must use our combined strength to change the course,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. The Democrats' own course, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, is one that he _ not <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ has set with what he called his progressive campaign centered on a call for `` jobs, peace and justice.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> this week met with black Democrats, and later said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would have a major role at the convention and in the fall campaign. `` If I put forth a vision, then reward me,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I do not foresee confrontation,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` We can effectively negotiate on mutually respectful terms.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he expects the anchors of his campaign _ including workers' pay, reduced military spending and the war on drugs _ to become planks in the party's 1988 platform. He said he has been given six seats on the platform committee, as has <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>. As the likely nominee, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would wield great power over the platform. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he, too, will help set the Democrats' agenda `` We've set the tone for the country,'' he said. If disputes occur, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, he and his supporters might bypass the platform writers and take their issues to the full convention. `` There's room to take one's case to the floor,'' he said.

 Lick Observatory, a pioneering mountaintop astronomical complex that once boasted the world's largest telescope, observes its 100th skywatching anniversary Wednesday It was at Lick where <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> found the fifth moon of <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>; where the existence was established of innumerable distant galaxies; where expansion of the universe was mapped; and where scientists studied how stars form and age. Businessman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lick </PERSON>, who set up a trust and earmarked $ 700,000 for construction of the telescope and observatory, made his orders clear: `` Build a powerful telescope, superior and more powerful than any telescope yet made.'' Lick died in 1876, 12 years before the observatory was ready for operation. But his remains were moved to <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hamiliton </LOCATION> in January 1887 and placed in a vault at the base of the Lick telescope. Astronomy was a strange choice for Lick, who got his start making pianos in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, made a fortune in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> real estate and once owned <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and big pieces of downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Lick Observatory was built on 4,430-foot <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION>, and an immense 36-inch lens was mounted on a 57-foot tube _ then the world's biggest telescope. `` It was the first real demonstration of the value of being on a mountaintop,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, an assistant Lick director, noting that before Lick, most observatories were in cities. Later, mountaintop observatories became standard, encouraging the development of other pristine sites, including those in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Owned and operated by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Califoria </ORGANIZATION>, the observatory 60 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> has lost some of its glitter. But its seven telescope domes, offices and workshops have a world reputation for solid, valuable work. The telescope still functions, second in size only to the 40-inch refracting telescope at <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The Lick telescopes today also include the 120-inch <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> reflector, a 40-inch reflector, two 24-inch reflectors and a twin 20-inch refractor. The telescopes are used all the time, and are most in demand for moonless nights. Lick also pioneered the use of reflecting telescopes, which use a mirror instead of a lens to focus light.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> plan to close their fourth summit with a joint communique celebrating progress on two obstacles to a strategic arms treaty, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Tuesday. The leaders, who attended signing ceremonies Tuesday for less important agreements, on Wednesday also will exchange copies of a ratified treaty to eliminate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet medium-range missiles. That pact was signed at the summit last December, ratified within the past week by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the Soviet Presidium, and flown to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Progress on the proposed strategic arms reduction treaty came on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for verifying limits on mobile missiles and a compromise on counting air-launched cruise missiles, said the senior administration official, who spoke on condition he not be identified But no progress was reported on <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, which the Soviets describe as the main impediment to a START agreement to cut long-range weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent. At the December summit, both leaders said they hoped to sign a strategic arms pact in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but talks stalled over <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, mobile missiles, rules on counting cruise missiles aboard warplanes, curbs on cruise missiles on submarines, and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> call to phase out heavy Soviet SS-18 missiles. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> expressed exasperation at the pace of the talks, although both sides said they hoped the treaty could be signed by the end of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday that maybe it's `` time to bang our fists on the table'' to end the impasse. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied: `` I'll do anything that works,'' but said he would not bargain away <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative. `` It's never been a part of the negotiations,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Because of difficulties in counting mobile missiles, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had wanted to ban them, although it is developing one, the Midgetman. The Soviets declined to get rid of their two mobile missiles, the SS-24 and SS-25. During the summit, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> negotiators offered a proposal they had been working on for months, to restrict mobile missiles to carefully defined geographical areas, dubbed `` garrisons,'' which would be monitored by on-site inspection as well as surveillance from spy satellites. `` The Soviets reacted positively to our proposal,'' said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> referred on Monday to progress on the mobile issue, but neither the Soviets nor the Americans gave details of the proposal. Arms control working groups, headed by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON> for the Americans and Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> for the Soviets, also moved toward a compromise on counting the number of cruise missiles aboard warplanes. The Americans proposed that certain air bases be designated for nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, with every warplane stationed there counted as carrying an agreed number of weapons, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official. The two sides have set to a limit of 6,000 warheads apiece. Each bomber carrying gravity bombs and Short-Range Air-Launched Missiles would be counted as one warhead. But negotiators have not agreed how many warheads to count as being aboard each warplane. The Americans want to `` discount'' the number, counting each heavy bomber as carrying 10 cruise missiles, whereas the Russians would put the number closer to 20. Soviet officials complained that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had rejected a Soviet proposal to resolve another sticking point, verifying proposed limits on submarine-launched cruise missiles. <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON>, a Soviet scientist who has advised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on arms-related issues, told a news conference that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was blocking progress by sticking to its policy of refusing to acknowledge whether or not a submarine or ship carries nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON> said the Americans had rejected a Soviet proposal for an experiment to determine whether nuclear-missiles can be detected aboard ships by measuring neutron and gamma ray emissions. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will issue their joint communique as the summit winds up. They had one more business session scheduled for Wednesday and then a departure ceremony on Thursday. Another senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who also demanded anonymity, said the statment would be issued Wednesday or Thursday, depending on the pace of talks senior negotiators were holding. In addition to the planned exchange of the ratified Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty and progress in the START talks, the two sides signed a handful of lesser agreements on Tuesday. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and his Soviet counterpart <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> signed agreements on prior notification of ballistic missile tests and for an experiment to tighten verification techniques on a 1974 treaty limiting nuclear tests to 150 kilotons. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>, and Soviet Culture Minister <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakharov </PERSON> signed a protocol extending for another three years a cultural agreement signed in 1985. Other agreements were signed covering transportation, civilian atomic reactor programs, radio navigation, fisheries and maritime rescue.

 A committee of gun owners filed petitions Tuesday to block <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s pioneering ban on sales of Saturday Night Specials or cheap handguns and to force a public vote on the gun control bill in November. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Griisser </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> the Gun Ban, submitted petitions to the secretary of state that he said contained signatures of more than 22,000 voters opposed to the ban. The committee will need 33,044 valid signatures by the end of June to force the bill to referendum, and at least one-third of those were due Tuesday. <PERSON> Griisser </PERSON> challenged statements by supporters of the law that it will only ban Saturday Night Specials that serve no useful, lawful purpose. `` We feel that this bill has the potential to ban all handguns,'' he said. If the law survives the challenge from gun owners, it will be illegal to sell or manufacture any handguns in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> unless they are approved by a nine-member review board appointed by the governor. The board is directed to ban guns that are cheaply made of poor quality materials and are so inaccurate that they ca n't be used for sporting purposes or self defense. It also is directed to ban guns made of plastics or ceramics that ca n't be detected by metal detectors. It is the first state law attempting to ban the sale of Saturday Night Specials, and <PERSON> Gliisser </PERSON> said putting it to a vote in November `` is going to be a test case for the nation.'' The bill drew broad support from gun control groups when it was signed May 23 by Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>. Among those attending was White House Press Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who was seriously wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who was armed with the type of gun that would be banned by the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> law. <PERSON> Griisser </PERSON> said his committee has collected about $ 80,000, including $ 50,000 from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, for its drive to defeat the gun law. Gun owners are petitioning only one part of the bill. They want to retain the second part, which would repeal a ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> that victims of crimes committed with Saturday Night Specials can sue the makers and sellers of the handguns. State Attorney General <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> said Tuesday he hopes to rule by next week whether only half of the bill can be subject to referendum and, if so, whether the repeal of the court ruling can stand if the rest of the law is defeated by voters.

 Bodies remained unburied Tuesday at 17 cemeteries in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area in the second day of a strike by gravediggers with no new contract talks scheduled. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 265 have complained that under current provisions, cemetery owners can hire subcontractors for work usually performed by union employees. However, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantwell </PERSON>, an attorney representing two associations of cemetery owners, said the union concerns are unfounded. `` We've given them every assurance that -LRB- owner's -RRB- contracting out is not aimed at busting the union,.'' <PERSON> Cantwell </PERSON> said. `` I think the objection is more emotional than rational.'' <PERSON> Cantwell </PERSON> said owners have always used subcontractors forts, such as laying concrete and removing hazardous trees. Under the owners' provisions, subcontractors would be certain projec used only for jobs that would not threaten union positions, he said. `` But they've said that until we take that off the table, they are unwilling to negotiate about anything,'' he said. The business agent for the local said the specific jobs that can be contracted out are broadly mentioned in the current provisions. `` It's nice to have assurances, but we're negotiating a contract here,'' said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaudio </PERSON>. `` Their proposal is based on an open-ended pclosed early Tuesday. <PERSON> Goolsby </PERSON> said the heat to the grease vat was turned off when the restaurant closed, but before it began to cool off it was 400 degrees Fahrenheit.

 Taxicabs are scarce, subway signs are indecipherable and police guards are everywhere. So when the going gets tough in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, tough <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> visitors go shopping. Many of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> staffers and news reporters attending the <LOCATION> Reagan-Gorbachev </LOCATION> summit are forced to spend most of their time in the Hotel Mezhdunarodnaya press center. When they grab a few minutes of free time, they usually head for the hotel's duty-free <LOCATION> Beryozka </LOCATION> gift shop, which accepts <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars and other hard foreign currencies. Among the recent gift shop customers was <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, press secretary to first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who was found inspecting oil paintings ofreligious figures. `` You caught me,'' she laughingly told a reporter. Another man who spent time the hotel was <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official who flew to the Soviet capital from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to lend a hand at summit coverage. He discovered that only a few reporters are selected to accompany President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on his summit forays. Hundreds of other media people stay close to the press center, watching outside events on television monitors and attending press briefings by a steady stream of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet officials. `` I really haven ` t had time to get out since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> arrived,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> stenographer <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> has spent virtually all her time in the `` Mezh,'' as the press hotel is nicknamed, or shuttling across town by bus to the Hotel Rossiya, where the television networks maintain headquarters. She slipped into the shop to buy souvenirs for a 3-year-old boy back home. Some of the most popular items on display are painted wooden Russian dolls, whose prices range from $ 3 to $ 48. Also favored are lacquered boxes, lifelike children's dolls and coffee table picture books. Determined shoppers who ventured out to the giant GUM department store near Red Square and other local shops were disappointed by the merchandise. `` I feel sorry for the Russians _ they do n't have anything,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> flight attendant. At the `` Marathon,'' a neighborhood cooperative store, one American shopper found 10 sweatshirts, a few headbands and a dozen pair of blue jeans _ one of which cost the equivalent of $ 176 in rubles. The biggest crowd stood around a display of European-made, low-heeled leather shoes. Besides shopping, the American summiteers enjoy eating the caviar, ham and cheese sandwiches at the press center or sampling the borscht, chicken <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, mushroom soup and other Russian fare in hotel restaurants. Far more popular, however, were the free hamburgers that a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> entrepreneur, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiers </PERSON>, was dispensing at a kitchen in the Hotel Mezh. <PERSON> Spiers </PERSON>, president of a chain of fast-food restaurants called Fast Track, shipped in 10,000 hamburger patties to serve in a summit restaurant operated by Cajun cook <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Folse </PERSON>. When the restaurant's $ 16 cover charge _ fixed by the Soviets _ turned away many prospective customers, <PERSON> Spiers </PERSON> decided to give his hamburgers away. He says he figures his $ 25,000 loss is worth all the publicity. `` Representatives of every major media have eaten my burgers,'' he said.

He said the new Afghan prime minister, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON>, indicated that plans could be made to receive 1 million returnees a year. <PERSON> Stenbaeck </PERSON> said the `` clear message'' from leaders of the Moslem guerrillas, who also met with the group, was that under present conditions the refugees should not return. Guerrilla leaders said the situation may change after Aug. 15, the date by which half of the 100,000 Soviet troops are scheduled to have left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> under a settlement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> April 14. A Swedish-financed survey released Monday in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> said it would take years and billions of dollars before agricultural production could be brought back to levels that could support the returning refugees. <PERSON> Stenbaeck </PERSON> said another major barrier to repatriation was the estimated 5 million anti-personnel mines strewn across <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` Who will take the responsibility for clearing them?'' he asked.

 Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> charged Tuesday that one of the dissidents and refuseniks invited to meet President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was a Nazi war criminal. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> made the allegation at a news conference when asked to comment on a question from a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> student to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that he had invited the `` Gestapo'' or German `` Polizei'' to his Monday meeting with dissidents and refuseniks and their families. The student was repeating an allegation voiced Tuesday by the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, which said that <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON>, one of those at the meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, `` voluntarily joined <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> police'' in 1942, one year after the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> invasion of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in World War II. The Communist party newspaper Pravda and government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> also carried negative commentaries on the meeting, attacking some of the participants by name. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON> was sentenced to death by military tribunal in 1944, but that his sentence was later commuted to 20 years' imprisonment In 1955, <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON> was released on parole under a Soviet government decree, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It did not say why. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> journalists who attended <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s reception for the dissidents, which was criticized by <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> officials, turned up the background on Rozhko by looking at Soviet records They `` were rather curious and looked into the dossier of the invited,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> explained. `` They found out that one of them in fact was a policeman sharing in the occupation of our country by <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> ... so he was a former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> agent and a war criminal.'' When asked about the allegation that a former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> was invited to the meeting, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> student he did not know anything about the man. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who asked not to be identified said <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON> is a resident of the town of <LOCATION> Grozdno </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>, a part of the western <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ravaged during Nazi occupation. <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON> was born in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and came to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a child with his parents, the official said. He has been trying to emigrate for the past 20 years, but the Soviets have denied him permission to leave. The source suggested that Soviet authorities have charged before that <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON> had a Nazi background, but `` never once gave us one shred of evidence of his Nazi activities.'' The official said, `` This was not an issue -LRB- on <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON>'s emigration -RRB- until the Soviets brought it up this week.'' Memories of the struggle against the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in World War II are kept vividly alive in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which estimates that 20 million citizens died in battles against <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s troops. The Soviet charges against <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON> were likely therefore to lend a highly negative connotation to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting with the refuseniks, which unlike all other events in his program was reported with negative comment by the state-run Soviet media. A senior Soviet journalist, speaking privately, said that commentators at first were horrified when they learned of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plans to meet with dissidents and refuseniks at his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> residence But he indicated they were then ordered to tone comment down, and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders had made clear there would be no other reaction to the meeting, he said. Pravda, quoting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s reference to poet <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Pushkin </PERSON> that `` it's time'' for more Kremlin reforms, said, `` Indeed, it's time Time to stop speculating on the problems of human rights using this serious question as an easy reason for self-advertisement and politicizing.'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> criticized participants at the meeting, including <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>, a religious activist it accused of links with `` anti-Soviet clerical centers abroad,'' <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Timofeyev </PERSON>, a campaigner for press freedom, and <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON>, a 73-year-old American citizen who has been trying to emigrate with his family since 1975. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> accused the people invited to meet <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence of opposing official efforts at reform and have nothing to do with efforts at changing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because they want only to leave or to dismantle its Communist system. `` Those invited to <LOCATION> Spaso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> are hampering -LRB- reforms -RRB- by their noisy behavior, because far from being interested in them, they are pursuing their selfish goals _ self-advertisement, gifts and praise from the West,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> signed an agreement on Tuesday with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to end a seven-year trade dispute over the sale of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> almonds. Under the six-year agreement, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> agreed to allow annual almond imports from all sources to increase to $ 20 million during the first three years.

In return, the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Almond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> agreed to withdraw a petition it had filed in January 1987 charging <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> with unfair trade practices. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s ambassador, P.K <PERSON> Kaul </PERSON>, attended a ceremony Tuesday to mark an end to the dispute. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> almond sales to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> have averaged around $ 4 million a year in recent years. `` This agreement will create significant additional opportunities for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> almond growers and demonstrate to the world that we are serious about expanding our markets,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday that she and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> have had such hectic schedules during the U.S.-Soviet summit that they are `` like ships passing in the night.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who met twice with reporters aboard the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plane that took her on a day-trip to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, said she's `` pretty well adjusted'' to the jet lag and the eight-hour time difference between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The first couple had a 3 -LCB- - day stopover in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, in order to adjust to the time change and to prepare for the five-day superpower summit `` I was awake at 6 a.m. this morning, and usually I wake up at 3 a.m., so that's progress,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Given the observation by some reporters that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appeared quite tired, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked how her husband was sleeping. `` He sleeps fine,'' she said. However, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said at a briefing that while there was no problem with the president's health, `` he did have a difficult night's sleep And we're all a little tired.'' <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, the Soviet spokesman, took Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s side, saying he walked up a steep staircase with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` I felt breathless, but the president felt OK,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. The first lady said she's had little chance to discuss summit topics with her husband, due to her own heavy schedule of touring Soviet monuments and museums, as well as the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> tour. `` We're just like ships passing in the night,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 Standing beneath a towering bust of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> quoted from <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON>'s once-banned `` Doctor Zhivago'' Tuesday in a fervent plea that `` the first breath of freedom'' be allowed to flourish in the Soviet state. He won a standing ovation from about 2,000 teachers and students at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where his host, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, earned a degree in 1954. In a session that covered topics as diverse as the plight of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> to the two-term restriction on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took questions from a stage beneath <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s bust and a banner emblazoned with a hammer and sickle. `` Let me cite one of the most eloquent contemporary passages on human freedom,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, `` from one of the greatest writers of the 20th century.'' With that he quoted <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON>'s famous novel, banned for many years in the land where its author lived: `` I think that if the beast who sleeps in man could be held down by threats, any kind of threat, whether of jail or of retirbution after death, then the highest emblem of humanity would be the lion tamer in the circus with his whip, not the prophet who sacrificed himself. But this is just the point: what has for centuries raised man above the beast in not the cudgel, but an inward music, the irresistible power of unarmed truth.'' Soviet young people are living `` in one of the most exciting, hopeful times in Soviet history'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, when `` the first breath of freedom stirs in the air.'' The world is undergoing an economic revolution, but progress `` is not foreordained,'' he said. `` The key is freedom _ freedom of thought, freedom of information, freedom of communication,'' he said. One student told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that a delegation of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> had traveled here because they found it impossible to meet with him in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he did not know they had sought an audience, and that `` I'd be very happy to see them.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had given the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> millions of acres of land and established reservations where they could live if they chose. `` We've done everything we can to meet their demands as to how they want to live. Maybe we made a mistake. Maybe we should not have humored them'' and insisted that they become integrated in American life. He also said that after he leaves the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> he would deliver after-dinner speeches preaching his conservative political agenda and campaigning for a constitutional amendment restoring a president's ability to serve more than two full terms. In a luncheon meeting with writers, filmmakers and other artists at the Writers Union, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised what he called a recent thaw in the Soviet arts. Dancer <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> and cellist <PERSON> Slava </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> should be able to perform again in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and Nobel Prize winning author <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> should be published `` in the land he dearly loves,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` He spoke very sincerely, he spoke about his private life and he mentioned all those names which are very dear to Russian intelligentsia,'' <PERSON> Fyodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON>, an adviser to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech at the Writers Union. But <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Unguryanu </PERSON>, a history student from the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>, said `` the leader of a great country should be more intellectual.'' `` But he is charismatic,'' said <PERSON> Unguryanu </PERSON>. He added that in signing a treaty banning medium - and shorter-range nuclear missiles, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` has shown us a good example of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> political pragmatism. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasyanin </PERSON>, 20, a student in the linguistic department and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> said, `` Really, the term ` Great Communicator' is good for him.'' He said that some of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s answers did not correspond to the questions, but he made a good imression anyway. Physics graduate student <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazkov </PERSON>, 23, said, `` It's too bad <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has to leave office. There are those who do n't agree with me, but I'd like to see him elected to a third term. Students interviewed before and after the meeting said they were members of the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and had received their tickets from the organization. Students from different university departments approached two microphones in an orderly manner, suggesting their order and questions were prearranged.

 A flight attendant who was injured when a pilot abruptly turned a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC9 to avoid a small plane said Tuesday that passengers remained calm and she did n't know what happened until after they landed. <PERSON> Milotka </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebelt </PERSON> said she was bent over her luggage near the rear of the airplane when the small plane was spotted about 100 feet away. `` It just happened in a split-second,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Liebelt </PERSON> said Tuesday from her <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> home. `` Before I could realize what was going on, I was on the floor with my bag in my lap.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Liebelt </PERSON> was the only person reported injured when <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Flight 283 narrowly missed colliding with the small plane while the jet prepared to land Monday at <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The flight from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> carried 79 passengers and a crew of five. Mrs. <PERSON> Liebelt </PERSON>, 35, was treated at <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for bruises to her back and left knee. `` I do n't see how that -LRB- small -RRB- plane could not have seen us,'' she said. `` Thank God that our first officer responded instantly.'' `` The first officer -LRB- co-pilot -RRB- observed a light aircraft approximately 100 feet below our aircraft and to the right. He initiated a sharp climb to the left and gained an additional 800 feet of altitude,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` The Continential pilot did a professional job in reacting the way he had been trained.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said the airline does not release crew members' names. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> are investigating the incident, officials said Tuesday. The encounter occurred in restricted air space at about 7,000 feet and five miles southeast of the airport. However, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mort </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that air traffic controllers were unable to track the small plane, which did n't show up on radar. Small planes entering restricted airspace near airports are required to get tower permission and to carry transponders, which produce a signal to display airplane identification on radar screens. Mrs. <PERSON> Liebelt </PERSON> said the flight had been uneventful and the passengers, who were in their seats in preparation for landing at the time of the sudden maneuver, remained calm. `` It's amazing when things happen, you do n't have time to get scared. You just assume your responsibilities,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Liebelt </PERSON> said the plane's captain told the passengers what had happened after the plane landed at <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Houston-Area Restaurant Owner Cited For Hiring Illegal Aliens</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal agents slapped $ 10,000 worth of citations on the owner of a <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> restaurant chain Tuesday, claiming he is <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s most blatant employer of illegal aliens. Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents delivered citations and notices of intent to fine to lawyers for <PERSON> Ghulan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bombaywala </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <PERSON> Marco </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Restaurants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> The chain operates 10 Mexican restaurants that employ about 500 people, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> Bombaywala </PERSON>'s lawyer said the government was overreacting. Under provisions of the 1986 Immigration Reform Act, Tuesday was the last day federal officials had to serve citations before issuing fines. Starting Wednesday, `` we can go directly to the fine. That's the major difference beginning June 1,'' INS District Director <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Parra </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Parra </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bombaywala </PERSON> and his lawyer, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gee </PERSON>, had 30 days to respond to Tuesday's notices by either paying the fine or requesting a hearing before a federal administrative law judge. Gee said they likely would request the hearing. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials said they raided one <PERSON> Marco </PERSON>'s Restaurant in January and arrested 18 illegal aliens working there. In April, another raid netted nine illegal workers. `` He did n't have any intention to clean up his act,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> deputy director in charge of employer sanctions. `` The top rung of the ladder _ the corporate structure _ had some knowledge.'' But Gee said the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> citations and fines were an overreaction by the government and the result of a misunderstanding. `` Our client has made very strenuous efforts to comply,'' Gee said. `` All of our people now are in compliance.'' Gee, who described <PERSON> Bombaywala </PERSON> as a Pakistani who has become a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen, said his client has made good-faith efforts by meeting with <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials and by getting attorneys for undocumented aliens who wished to apply for amnesty. `` We have a disagreement -LRB- with the INS -RRB- as to what constitutes a good-faith effort,'' Gee said. He estimated more than 100 aliens had been aided by <PERSON> Bombaywala </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Finch </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> special agent who delivered the four-page citation and intent to fine to Gee with about a dozen reporters and photographers in tow, said the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> INS office was working about 25 such cases, with around 15 nearing the stage at which fines will be sought. <PERSON> Parra </PERSON> said most of the 66,000 <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> businesses have cooperated with immigration officials to comply with the tough, new federal laws regarding hiring of illegal aliens. `` We are not going to tolerate non-compliance with the law,'' he said. `` The message to employers is: It's no longer good business to hire illegal aliens.''

 Thousands of Armenians stayed away from work on Tuesday in a general strike that shut down factories and mass transportation in a city at the center of an ethnic dispute, a local resident said. Also Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency announced that two officials were dismissed from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for alleged negligence that led to the violence between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. In the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, round-the-clock demonstrations were reported to be continuing for a fifth day. The resident of the city of <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, reached by telephone from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said public transport was not running and that factories and other businesses in the city were closed in a strike that had been going on for days. `` People are n't working,'' the woman said. Asked how many, she answered: `` Many thousands. Everyone.'' She hung up the telephone before a reporter could ask her name or other questions. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, dissident journalist <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said the general strike had been under way for about a week. Telephone calls to <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> city offices and radio and television stations did not go through. <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> is the main city of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a region in the republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Armenians want the Armenian-dominated region to be made a part of their neighboring republic. Armenian literary critic <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>, 45, said by telephone from his <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> home that since Friday about 5,000 people have gathered during the day and 20,000 in the evening on the square outside the city's Opera Theater. He said smaller groups of protesters, mostly students, continued the vigil overnight, `` awaiting an official response to their demand.'' The protesters want <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s Supreme Soviet, the republic's parliament, to consider the annexation issue at a meeting next week, he said <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>, who spent four years in jail and six months in internal exile for distributing underground literature, said <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> authorities have not tried to stop the demonstrations. On Monday, <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, who is half-Armenian and half-Russian, said the crowd in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> swelled to about 300,000. It was unclear why the figure he cited was so much higher than that given by <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>. Armenians began agitating in mid-February for the right to annex Nagorno-Karabakh. At the end of the month, ethnic rioting broke out in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>. At least 32 people _ six <PERSON> Azerbaijanis </PERSON> and 26 Armenians _ were killed. Most of the 160,000 residents of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> are ethnic Armenians, most of them Christians. Since 1923, the region has been part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, whose titular ethnic group is predominantly Moslem. The Soviet government rejected the demand to change jurisdiction over Nagoro-Karabakh, opting instead for a program of social and economic development. On May 21, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials fired the two leaders of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, apparently because they had not quelled the unrest. New party shake-ups were announced Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the former first secretary of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> regional party committee, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kevorkov </PERSON>, was dismissed from the party because of his `` serious political mistakes.'' `` His errors resulted in the loss of the party organization's vanguard role and in the heightening of inter-ethnic relations,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said in announcing the action taken by a plenary meeting of the Azerbaijani party organization `` He was found to be personally responsible for the disorders that took place in the autonomous region.'' <PERSON> Kevorkov </PERSON> had been dismissed as head of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> party committee on Feb. 24. He was replaced by <PERSON> Genrikh </PERSON> <PERSON> Pogosyan </PERSON>, subsequently identified by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> as an Armenian born in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the plenum also dismissed from the party D.M. <PERSON> Muslim-Zade </PERSON>, the former first secretary of the <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> city committee, for `` serious shortcomings in organizational and political work that brought about the tragic developments in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>.''

 Republicans working Tuesday on their party platform accused the Democrats of being less open than the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> and of trying to hide liberal views of likely nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said of the Democrats, `` They are simply not interested in writing an honest, straightforward platform that expresses their true plan for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The Republican approach is one of openness.'' Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> said Republicans would force the Democrats `` to take the field'' on critical issues and would `` flush the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Democrats'' out, exposing what he said were their left-of-center views. The seven-member committee met to discuss social issues in one of four hearings it will hold before the national convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said in remarks to the committee that the value of the platform should be restored by shortening it and not `` making it a catch-all and promise-all.'' <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> has made a similar request concerning his party's platform. <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> said, `` The one major difference between Republicans and Democrats is that government must have a limited role.'' Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> urged the committee to include a strong rural plank in the platform. `` Sometimes policies of the federal government have discriminated against rural areas,'' <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said. `` We have heard about urban renewal, but seldom have we heard about rural revitalization.'' The party's 1980 and 1984 platforms, the latter particularly pleasing to conservatives, will serve as a basis for the 1988 platform, said <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, chairman of the platform committee. `` It's a good base,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said of the 1984 platform. `` But times have changed. There is a different emphasis that we will place on things.'' <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> said the 1984 platform `` established a base, a soul'' for the party. `` But times have changed, problems have changed,'' <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> said at a news conference held by the seven committee members during a lunch break. `` We want to take conservative approaches to solve the problems we see coming down the road.'' `` We have had no specific direction from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said, referring to likely <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` We will have a line of communication open. We're very interested in the vice president's views.'' As for the party's November opponents, <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> said, `` The Democrats face a level-with-America dilemma. Do they hide the liberal agenda and record of their nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, or do they level with Americans and detail their liberal goals and plans.''

<HEAD>Government Gives Toledo Zoo OK To Continue Panda Exhibit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> gave the Toledo Zoo the go-ahead Tuesday to continue exhibiting two giant pandas on loan from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON>, spokesman for the service, said export documents provided by the zoo late Friday have been reviewed and found to be acceptable. `` The permit is acceptable to us,'' <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON> said. `` The condition of the law has been met. That should settle it.'' He said the zoo will be notified by letter Wednesday and that the panda exhibit will be allowed to continue. However, a lawsuit is pending in which a wildlife group contends the pandas _ an endangered species _ are being exploited for commercial gain. In its federal suit against the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the World Wildlife Fund argues that the exhibit violates an international convention that bars trafficking in endangered species for commerical purposes. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> has set a hearing on the suit for June 13. The pandas entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on May 13 accompanied by an exemption form instead of a full Chinese export permit as required. The animals were allowed to begin their three-month exhibit last Tuesday as part of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>'s 150th anniversary celebration, but the <ORGANIZATION> USFWS </ORGANIZATION> gave the zoo until May 29 to provide the proper documentation.

 Fallen <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> returned to the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> theme park Tuesday and said he would try to buy back the ministry if it were liquidated in bankruptcy court. `` I would set up offices near here, which I probably will do. As every peice of ministry comes up for sale, I would buy it to restore it to the people it was meant for,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said in a break in a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> attorneys, his attorneys and <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, the primary builder of the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> theme park. `` I want to see the ministry restored 100 percent,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said, adding right now it `` looks bleak'' for the ministry. He said the meeting was to back up <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>'s claims against <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in the bankruptcy proceedings. <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, next to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, is the largest single creditor in the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> bankruptcy proceeding. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> after charges of paying off <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, a church secretary, to keep quiet about a sexual encounter with him, and that was followed by revelations of a lavish lifestyle led by <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. When he came out of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Outreach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> where the meeting was being held, a group of about a dozen supporters shouted words of support and hugged him. He said after the meeting he would be visiting friends and relatives and riding around the grounds of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he was there at <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>'s request, and charged that most of the records he had left behind when he left <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987 have been destroyed. `` Almost all of the blueprints of all the buildings are missing,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. When asked who might have destroyed the records, he said, `` Any of them who might want to take over the ministry.'' Pressed for further specifics, he said, `` I do n't know.'' Asked how he would buy back <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` I have a lot of friends.'' He again would not provide specifics. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said the meeting did not touch on whether he should come back to the ministry, but that he would if he were asked. `` I think everybody else has had a chance ... it's being sold off. What would be wrong with giving <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> a chance,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. The ministry is in bankruptcy court now, with up to $ 130 million in debt, and a reorganization plan calling for the sale of much of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets is up for final approval by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> on June 16 in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Before the meeting, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told reporters he wants to meet with new ministry trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> to ensure the ministry's <ORGANIZATION> Lifetime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> are given everything they're owed <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he would like to meet with <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, businessman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shinn </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knights </ORGANIZATION> minor-league baseball team and the new <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hornets </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, is one of the people interested in buying <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, and he would like to build a baseball stadium there. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> did n't say how long he'd remain in the area, but said his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, will join him in a few days. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, another <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> attorney, said the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> have left their home in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and are returning to their home in <LOCATION> Gatlinburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is being investigated by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> for possible mail fraud and tax evasion and is involved in lawsuits with <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> and his former attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Grutman </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who recently stepped down as <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> trustee, filed a $ 52 million lawsuit in January against <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, his wife and former top aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggert </PERSON>. Earlier, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Taggert </PERSON> sued <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.3 million and $ 187,000 respectively. In March, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> sued <PERSON> Grutman </PERSON> for $ 10,000 for conflict of interest. The <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> stayed at their former Tega Cay residence for several weeks in June 1987 as they attempted to regain control of the ministry from the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>. They also returned in October 1987 to visit <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s father <PERSON> Raleigh </PERSON>, who was ill at the time.

<HEAD>Norwegian Relief Group May Suspend Activities in Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Norwegian relief group said Tuesday it may suspend work in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> if a member of its staff who has been missing for 10 days does not turn up. Fears that Dr. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cools </PERSON>, a 32-year-old Belgian physician, was kidnapped have been expressed by the relief group NORWAC and others. `` Within one week we will stop working in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> if nothing happens,'' said <PERSON> Kristin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingebrigben </PERSON>, coordinator for the NORWAC group. `` We are also thinking of stopping our activities in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>,'' a port in northern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. NORWAC evacuated its seven staff members from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Saturday. It has 18 people in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Cools has worked with NORWAC for three months. He vanished May 21 after leaving his apartment in the <LOCATION> Rashidiyeh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> refugee camp near the ancient port of Tyre in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Ingebrigben </PERSON> said the group had no confirmation that Cools left the camp. She said he was bound for a base of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in Tyre to pick up his mail. `` We can not take the responsibility any longer for foreign people as long as we do n't know anything about what happened to Dr. Cools,'' she told a news conference at her group's headquarters in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police say they have no information about his disappearance. <ORGANIZATION> NORWAC </ORGANIZATION> said it did not know what happened to Cools despite contacting `` all the organizations and authorities concerned in the area.'' All Lebanese and Palestinian parties NORWAC approached denied involvement in the physician's disappearance, Ms. <PERSON> Ingebrigben </PERSON> said, and `` we did n't hear anything from anybody. We do n't accuse anyone of Jan's disappearance.'' <LOCATION> Rashidiyeh </LOCATION>'s `` popular committee,'' which runs the camp's day-to-day affairs, said last Thursday that gunmen seized Cools at a road junction near Tyre It gave no details and did not identify the alleged abductors. Ms. <PERSON> Ingebrigben </PERSON> said Cools' disappearance might affect humanitarian work in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. She did not elaborate, but said <ORGANIZATION> NORWAC </ORGANIZATION> had been in touch with other humanitarian agencies. Three other relief workers, two Scandinavians and a Briton, were kidnapped in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stening </PERSON>, 44, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> were seized Feb. 5 near <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, another southern port, and freed March 2. They worked for the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which cares for Palestinian refugees. <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> blamed the abduction of Stening and <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON> on Palestinians acting for personal motives. It evacuated foreign staff members and reduced its services in the refugee camps until the men were released. Palestinian guerrillas seized <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleridge </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> coordinator of the British relief agency <ORGANIZATION> Oxfam </ORGANIZATION>, and a Syrian aide in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> el-Hilweh refugee camp March 4 after he took photographs.

<TEXT>
 A final statement saying the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> can fix the chaotic economy ended a three three-day conference Tuesday during which delegates castigated party leaders and demanded their removal. Many delegates took the floor to accuse the leadership of bungling. Some said the failure to solve severe economic problems is destroying public trust in the party. `` Young people are reluctant to join the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> because they have no confidence in our organization,'' <PERSON> Metka </PERSON> <PERSON> Tekavcic </PERSON>, a Slovenian delegate, declared during debate. Fewer than 10 percent of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s 23 million people belong to the party and the number has been declining rapidly. In the opening speech of the conference Sunday, party chief <PERSON> Bosko </PERSON> <PERSON> Krunic </PERSON> rejected calls for a multiparty system. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has a foreign debt of $ 21 billion, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s highest annual inflation at 170 percent and an unemployment rate of 15 percent. Economic problems have caused increasing social and labor unrest. The 38-page final conference document was not made public immediately, but informants said it did not hold out the prospect of a special party congress to replace the leadership, as many delegates demanded. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, said the document declared: `` The party is capable of seeking and finding a way out of the political and economic crisis.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>, the document `` directs competent institutions and organs to complete the reform of the economic system, based on strong orientation toward market economy, by the end of the year.'' On Monday and Tuesday speakers said party leaders had not implemented reforms recommended in resolutions of the 1986 party congress and should be replaced if economic problems continue. Congresses are held every four years and have broad powers to change <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rules and personnel, but the conferences held between them are largely advisory. <PERSON> Boro </PERSON> <PERSON> Avramovic </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, the largest of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics, declared Tuesday: `` The party needs a general overhaul, and that process has to start with the Presidium -LRB- Politburo -RRB- of the Central Committee.'' Many delegates have criticized <PERSON> Krunic </PERSON>, the party chief, and his predecessor <PERSON> Milanko </PERSON> <PERSON> Renovica </PERSON> by name for not pursing reforms recommended by the 1986 congress. `` It is unlikely that those people who have led us into this crisis will be able to bring us out of it,'' said <PERSON> Rade </PERSON> <PERSON> Milicevic </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Luka </PERSON> <PERSON> Miletic </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zagreb </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Yugoslavs </PERSON> `` increasingly insist'' the entire Communist leadership be replaced since it had not fired officials who impeded radical reform. The government announced new austerity measures Saturday that party leaders acknowledged would be unpopular and cause more hardship. <PERSON> Krunic </PERSON> said in his speech Sunday that `` social upheavals are certain and may be grave.'' Included in the new plan are substantial price increases, wage cuts and currency devaluation. One result is likely to be lowering the standard of living, which already has declined by one-third since 1980. On Monday, many delegates said a special party congress should be held by the end of the year to replace the party leadership. `` Unless we carry through a complete social reform by next autumn, it will be necessary to call a special party congress,'' said <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, the Serbian party chief. Several delegates said Tuesday, however, that they opposed a special congress and preferred immediate action by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Vilma </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancek </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, the most industrially developed republic, said a congress `` would be a waste of time and money.'' `` Those who demand a special congress should have the courage to propose the replacement of the party Presidium, since the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has the power to recall members of the Presidium'' without holding a special congress, she said. Party officials have said the situation is not critical enough to warrant a special congress.

 Pianist <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON> solved another mystery about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s highest official on Tuesday night, finding out that when it comes to jazz, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is `` very into it.'' `` I'm ready to fly to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>,'' the 67-year-old American jazz great declared after his quintet played at a dinner President and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hosted for the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION>. In an interview before the performance at <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence where the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> are staying during the summit, <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON> said he was curious to find out what the general secretary and his wife think of American jazz. He got the answer despite the language barrier. `` I ca n't understand Russian, but I can understand body language,'' said the pianist, who added the general secretary appeared to be `` very into it'' and was seen tapping his foot, not an easy thing to do to <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON>'s odd rhythms. <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON>'s 36-year-old son <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, who plays bass guitar and trombone in the quintet, said he learned from a woman sitting near the general secretary that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> turned to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at one point during the music and asked if he like jazz. According to the younger <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON>, the 57-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> chief responded: `` I like good jazz, and this is good jazz.'' That puts <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the ranks of at least one other Soviet general secretary, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON>, who was reputed to be a jazz fan. At the opposite extreme, jazz struck a dissonant chord for Premier <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, who said in December 1963 that `` When I hear jazz, it's as if I had gas on the stomach.'' <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON> said that after his group's 15-minute performance, the <PERSON> Gorbachevs </PERSON> came up to him `` all smiles and complimentary.'' As for the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, who last heard <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON> in a Feb. 21 White House performance, `` They could n't have been kinder.'' The pianist said the president, a former <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> actor, told him at the February performance `` how much he loved the big bands and how much they were a part of American history.'' The group began with <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>'s `` Take the A Train,'' a well-known jazz classic in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because it is the theme song for a daily <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> shortwave </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> jazz program that has introduced thousands of Soviets to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> art form since the 1950s. Next was `` Someday my Prince Will Come'' and `` King for a Day.'' <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON> wound up with his 1958 standard `` Take Five,'' the first jazz single ever to go gold. <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> audience, which included Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, a fiddler from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, `` was more charged'' than any other he had played for in the halls of kings and presidents in his 50-year career. <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON>'s music is well known in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, through <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts and imported record albums and tapes. He toured the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in March and April of last year in a critically acclaimed concert series.

<HEAD>British Doctors Perform Third Transplant Using Fetal Brain Cells</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 British doctors have given a third sufferer of Parkinson's disease brain cells transplanted from an aborted fetus, a hospital announced Tuesday. A 58-year-old woman underwent the surgery May 17 at the <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neurosurgery </ORGANIZATION> and Neurology at <LOCATION> Smethwick </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. She was reported to be back home and showing `` an initially good response'' to the treatment. The hospital announced the development in a statement by neurologist <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>, whose team carried out <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s first known fetal brain-cell transplants in March and April Parkinson's disease is a potentially fatal condition that causes gradual loss of muscle control. Fetal tissue is thought to stimulate production of dopamine, a brain chemical lacking in Parkinson's disease. <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>'s disclosure last month that he used the experimental procedure provoked controversy. Critics complained it reduced the aborted fetus to the status of a human spare part. Others welcomed it as a possible medical breakthrough. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> has banned government scientists from carrying out surgery using tissue from aborted fetuses, pending study of the ethical, legal and medical questions involved. The first documented use of the experimental procedure was reported in January, when surgeons in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said they injected tissue from a miscarried fetus into the brains of two Parkinson's sufferers last September. Swedish doctors subsequently reported use of the technique, with disappointing results. <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> said last month that his team transplanted fetal brain cells into a 60-year-old woman and a 41-year-old man, both of whom were said to have shown `` dramatic improvement.'' <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> said the latest operation was carried out under guidelines issued by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> last month.

<HEAD>Relief for Drought-Stricken Farmers Signaled by USDA</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> signaled Tuesday it is prepared to assist farmers in the nation's drought-stricken heartland by easing curbs on the use of land idled under conservation programs. Hay production and cattle grazing on such land will be allowed in counties found to be suffering from a natural disaster that harms pasture and forage crops, the department said. The statement came amid heightened concern over a drought hammering broad stretches of the nation's heartland from south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to the Canadian border and as far west as <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Thus far, however, no disaster counties have been declared. The statement from <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertz </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, mainly outlined possibilities already open to the department. It contained no new programs. Under the 1985 Farm Act, farmers must devote a specified portion of their land to conservation uses if they are to be eligible for crop programs that produce federal payments. The amount of land involved varies from one crop to another. For example, it is 27.5 percent for wheat. Producers also receive payments for placing endangered land in the long-term Conservation Reserve Program. Under the law, haying and grazing are banned on acreage devoted to conservation programs. The theory is that farmers already derive economic benefit from the land in the form of government payments. But <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> may make exceptions in the case of natural disasters. In counties found to be suffering from such a disaster, <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> said, `` haying and grazing will be allowed for any consecutive five-month period between April 1 and October 1.'' He said determination of counties eligible will be made on a county-by-county basis. <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> said no requests from state and county offices will be approved if it appears that doing so will adversely effect haying operations in the counties involved. No hay or forage harvested may be sold, he added. A producer may charge a `` reasonable harvesting fee'' for allowing other farmers to hay and graze on his acreage, however, the department said. But it said he `` may not receive compensation for the value of the vegetative matter that is harvested or grazed.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> noted that a number of steps already have been taken in response to rising concern over the drought. He said producers enrolled in <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s wheat and feed grains programs may take part in the 0-92 disaster program, even though the March 11 deadline for participation has passed. Under the 0-92 program, farmers produce no crop but still receive 92 percent of the federal payments they otherwise would get. He also pointed to two programs under which the government provides subsidies to farmers to purchase livestock feed.

<HEAD>U.S., Soviets Clash Over Need for Nuclear Weapons Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s top arms control official, <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, said Tuesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will keep testing nuclear weapons to preserve its nuclear deterrent. A senior <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> official called such tests `` immoral.'' Speaking on the first day of a special four-week <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> session on disarmament, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> added that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not try to pass a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for arms cuts by Third World nations. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We are not going to come here and insist that developing countries somehow change their defense priorities for the acquisition of arms. `` Of course, we would like them to spend less money on arms and put more money into development of their own countries.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration wants to increase arms sales to foreign buyers this year to more than $ 15 billion, $ 3.3 billion more than last year. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is also a major arms supplier. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refused to sell to a foreign country seeking arms, `` they would go to another country that would say ` yes.''' When asked why <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> keeps testing nuclear weapons, he replied: `` The security policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies is based upon the concept of deterrence. `` And as long as this is the policy which undergirds our security and that of the Western alliance, we will continue to test, because the requirement exists.'' At a separate news conference, Deputy Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said, `` We decline this strategy and policy of nuclear deterrence, not only because of practical unusefulness but because of the immoral nature of this kind of deterrence. ... `` We think the time is right to stop the nuclear tests.'' <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> intends to `` reduce the number and might of nuclear tests conducted during each year'' and to press for adoption of a test ban treaty. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> opened the session by noting it began `` at a most opportune time ... -LRB- when -RRB- President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and General Secretary -LRB- <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are engaged in a dialogue in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> partly in the context of the reduction of strategic nuclear weapons.'' He expressed pleasure over the recent ratification of the U.S.-Soviet intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty to scrap medium and shorter-range nuclear missiles. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said it `` clearly shows that, with political will, agreements to reverse the nuclear-arms race are possible and compliance with them can be duly verified.'' He called on the superpowers to take the next step and cut in half their long-range nuclear arsenals under a strategic arms reduction treaty, or START. <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> told reporters the Soviets will seek to focus the attention of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> disarmament session on `` the whole range of nuclear issues, on the nuclear weapons test ban, prevention of the weapons' expansion into outer space, the soonest possible conclusion of a convention on the ban on chemical weapons,'' as well as reducing conventional forces. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants the session to stress cuts in conventional arms. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not seek to bring <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> into superpower talks to reduce nuclear arsenals. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would prefer a treaty that would include British and French weapons. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also seeks to balance European arms control with progress on human rights issues. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> stated in 1979 that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> should play a central role in disarmament, and that complete nuclear disarmament was the priority. No breakthroughs are expected to emerge at this <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> session, during which at least 25 presidents and prime ministers are scheduled to address the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> offered <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hope for a harmonious Democratic National Convention on Tuesday, and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> emerged from a seaside meeting with economists to renew his no-tax-increase pledge. With his two front-running presidential rivals taking a break from campaigning, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> stumped in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and spoke of the convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> this July. `` I do not foresee confrontation,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` We can effectively negotiate on mutually respectful terms.'' That kind of talk was bound to be welcomed by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as he and his supporters looked forward to gaining a mathematical lock on the nomination in the primary-season finale next Tuesday. In a weekend interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also had said he looked for a convention without the divisiveness that some feared. `` I think we're going to have a good convention,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I do n't see any deep divisions. ... I do n't see anything that ca n't be resolved.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his Republican nomination long assured, met with economists at his home at <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> seacoast. Afterward, he said he would reject a call for new taxes even if it is recommended by a blue-ribbon bipartisan commission. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who often says he wants to become `` the education president,'' said higher local school taxes might be needed. `` They may have to,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Ninety-three percent of the money for education comes from sources other than the federal government. If it's taxes, that's where it has to be. It is n't going to be at the federal level, absolutely. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged the Federal Reserve not to tighten credit too much, which he said risks shutting down economic growth. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stuck to his duties as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, spending the day at the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. He had an evening fund-raiser in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. The race for the presidency, at a quiet point in the campaign season, drew a pleased comment from the Soviet side at the summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Soviet government spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said: `` What we like about your campaign is that the Soviet-American relations, at least as I see it, are not an issue. Everybody agrees, both candidates agree, that you must have normal relations with our country. We like it.'' While <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he foresaw no major convention rifts, he still left open the possibility of a convention floor fight. He said he expects the issues of his campaign _ including workers' pay, reduced military spending and the war on drugs _ to become planks in the party's 1988 platform <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also talked about the vice presidential spot on the ticket, repeating his contention that `` I've earned consideration'' for the No. 2 spot with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should win the nomination. The presidential primary season ends Tuesday with the heftiest delegate prize, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and also contests in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was to resume campaigning after flying to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Wednesday. He planned stops in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, and a brief visit back where it all began _ in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where party caucuses in the February cold were the initial delegate event of the season. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> planned a breakfast meeting with supporters pointing toward the fall race against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the farm state, as he crossed the country. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> both said over the Memorial Day weekend that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would play a major part in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' expected fall campaign against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But both said the nature of that role had n't yet been worked out. There are 466 Democratic delegates at stake in next Tuesday's primaries _ enough to put <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over the 2,081 needed to nominate The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor can lay claim to more than 1,700 delegates now, compared with fewer than 1,000 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was weighing fall campaign strategies with advisers as his campaign faced a series of polls showing him trailing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> nationally. The vice president acknowledged to reporters his campaign is facing a money crunch of sorts that might require him to cut back on summer campaign travel. The problem is he has nearly reached the federal spending limit for the primary campaign. `` It's expensive to take this show on the road,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently met with embattled Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, whose problems some Republicans say are damaging to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> on Monday night, said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had `` talked frankly about the campaign.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said if he were to resign now it would harm <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` because people would say there was something wrong.'' He left open the possibility, however, that he might leave office by the end of summer.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday he would reject any call for a federal tax increase, even if one came from a blue-ribbon bipartisan commission now working on ways to trim the huge federal deficit. However, he also said that higher local school taxes might be needed to carry out his education policies. On another economic subject, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cautioned the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> against tightening credit too much, saying, `` I do n't want to see action taken that's going to shut down economic growth.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the all-but-certain Republican presidential nominee, met with a group of private economic advisers, then spoke with reporters in a meeting hall in this oceanside town where he has a vacation home. He said that, while he had full confidence in <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, he wanted to voice `` a word of caution.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in recent weeks has been slightly tightening credit in hopes that by nudging up interest rates it can keep inflation in check. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` there was some expression of concern'' about recent <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> actions among the economists during the first day of a two-day session. The group included <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON>, a former chairman of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>. They are two of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s most frequently consulted economic advisers <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON> quit his <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> post after his advocacy of tax increases to reduce the federal deficit ran afoul of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration no-new-taxes policy. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> policymakers, `` I think they are putting a great emphasis on inflation. Whether it's too much, I do n't know. ... It's a tough balancing thing.'' In response to a reporter's question, he said he would reject the notion of a tax increase even if it were part of the recommendations of the bipartisan commission now at work. The panel, which includes administration appointees as well as members appointed by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressional leaders, was formed earlier this year to seek ways to trim the nation's massive budget deficit. `` It seems to me that commission might well come up with a tax increase,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And I'll be saying, wait a minute, I've taken my case to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people to hold the line on taxes. The commission, which will also gain two new members appointed by the president-elect after the November election, is scheduled to present its findings in 1989. `` I wold be interested in their views, but not persuaded'' if a tax increase is included, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. However, the vice president, who has told audiences he wants to be the `` education president'' and has stressed educational issues in his campaign, was asked if local school taxing authorites might have to increase taxes to carry out some of the still-unspecified programs he envisions. `` They may have to,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Ninety-three percent of the money for education comes from sources other than the federal government. If it's taxes, that's where it has to be. It is n't going to be at the federal level, absolutely. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is spending a week at his family oceanside retreat in a series of meetings with advisers and Republican consultants. The vice president said that there was wide support among the economists for his propsal for a `` flexible freeze'' on spending to reduce the budget deficit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan would hold federal spending, except for Social Security benefits, to the levels of the 1989 budget plus inflation. Individual programs would not have to be frozen. However, for every one that went up, another would have to go down by a corresponding amount. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says such a plan could result in a balanced budget within four years. He said there was some discussion of taxes at Tuesday's meeting, but that he made his position clear from the outset that he opposed any form of tax increase. On other subjects, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: _ Said he was pleased with how things were going in the superpower talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and did not think that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` offended the Soviets by talking too much about human rights I do n't believe that for a minute.'' _ Said that his wait-and-see position on Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has n't changed `` We're so close to hearing from that independent counsel we ought to get the report and let <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> sort all that out.'' _ Said remarks like a recent comment by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> that he was a `` country club Republican'' did n't bother `` Listen, that's just part of the territory. That was mild, they did n't even lay a glove on me.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said over the weekend that his campaign was running low on cash and tht it might have to curtail some travel plans after the June 7 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary. Aide <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> said on Tuesday that, of the $ 29.5 million raised so far by the campaign, including $ 7 million in federal matching funds, less than $ 1.5 million is left in campaign coffers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has raised the maximum allowed by law for pre-convention spending.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pronounced the jazz `` good,'' and the rest of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> society tapped their feet to the distinctly American rhythms at President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s lavish dinner Tuesday for the Soviet leader and his wife. The superpower leaders exchanged toasts touching on arms issues, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the two nations should work together `` that we might forever keep our swords at our sides.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> recalled the history of Soviet-U.S. relations, from their World War II alliance to the tensions of the Cold War era, when `` we all felt the breath of impending catastrophe.'' `` Even today, we're sometimes chilled by cold winds,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. He said the two countries `` may be standing at the threshold of a uniquely interesting period in the history of our two nations'' and added: `` May the years to come bring a healthier international environment.'' Weightier issues aside, the evening was filled with the rhythms of jazz great <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON>'s quintet. The musician is one of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' favorite performers. Jazz, which began in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is heard by thousands of Soviets though a daily <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> shortwave radio program. And <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON> has toured the country in critically acclaimed concert series. `` I ca n't understand Russian, but I can understand body language,'' said <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON>, who added that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appeared to be `` very into it.'' <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON>'s 36-year-old son <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, who plays bass guitar and trombone in the group, said he learned from a woman sitting near <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> turned to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at one point during the music and asked if he liked jazz. According to the younger <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> chief responded, `` I like good jazz and this is good jazz.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the 120 guests seemed to enjoy the the lobster bisque, supreme of chicken with truffle sauce and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> wines. During the dinner party, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was seated next to the wrong man. The official seating chart called for <PERSON> Aleksandr </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s central committee, to be on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s left, while Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was on the other side. In fact, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s dinner partner was <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, editor of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News, the English language weekly newspaper and a beacon of glasnost. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokeswoman, said she did not know how the confusion occurred. Said Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> of the mix-up: `` I hope somebody was able to tell the president.'' Soviet dissident <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> came to the dinner, as did the elite of Soviet political, cultural, scientific and sports circles. The guest listed ranged from <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, No. 2 in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, to Olympic gold medalist <PERSON> Katya </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordeyeva </PERSON> and Bolshoi ballerinas <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Ananiashvili </PERSON> and <PERSON> Natalya </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessmertnova </PERSON>, and Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Irina </PERSON> <PERSON> Virganskiy </PERSON>, and her husband, <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON>, snubbed the dinner. `` They accepted, but they did not arrive,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said. The couple did not give a reason for their no-show. The Russian guests appeared to appreciate the entertainment, and many tapped along with their feet as <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON>'s quintet played `` Take the A Train,'' `` Take Five,'' and `` Some Day My Prince will Come.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, told reporters he believed the summit was `` very important as a continuation of mutual understanding and achieving trust.'' Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, in genial mood as he raised a vodka toast in the direction of the press, made an extra point of greeting <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Gorbachevs </PERSON> posed for pictures briefly before walking into the resplendent towering reception rooms at <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a mansion built in czarist days and now the residence of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>. The first lady wore a gray and white <PERSON> Galanos </PERSON> knee-length dress, while Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wore a shimmery fitted gold tunic top with a ruffled collar and a straight black satin skirt. The crowd of Soviet and American guests arrived about 30 minutes before the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION>, and mingled in an ornate anteroom while they sipped drinks and listened to soft violin music. `` The atmosphere is terrific,'' said Ambassador <PERSON> Selwa </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, the American chief of protocol who helped usher guests into <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Similarities Between Taiwan, Aloha Crash Only Coincidence, Boeing
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 that disintegrated and crashed over <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1981 and another one that lost part of its fuselage over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in April were built back-to-back, but <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials Tuesday attributed any similarities to coincidence. The 151st 737-200 model <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> produced was the <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> jet that broke up at 22,000 feet over central <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> Aug. 22, 1981, killing all 110 people on board. No. 152 was the <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> aircraft on which a 20-foot section of forward upper fuselage ripped away at 24,000 feet on April 28. A flight attendant fell to her death and 61 passengers were injured, but the flight crew landed the plane safely. The cause of the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident is still under investigation. But the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines flying older 737s to re-inspect the aircraft, including mandatory electronic testing of planes with more than 50,000 landings. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> believes the Far Eastern crash was caused by maintenance problems, spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> said. Any connection between that crash and the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident are `` a series of coincidences,'' <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said. `` We do not think that is a fair assessment'' to directly link the two, he said. At the time of the planes' manufacture in 1969, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> was turning out two or three 737s a month, <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said. He said he knew of no other problems involving 737s made about that time. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> vice president and general manager for engineering, was quoted by The Wall Street Journal Tuesday as saying the consecutive aircraft numbers were coincidence. Although both accidents involved the same part of the fuselage, nothing was inherently wrong with that portion of the aircraft, <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON> said. He told the Journal that the Taiwanese 737 repeatedly was used to ship fish in open containers, and corrosive salt water may have gotten into the cargo hold. The newspaper said Far Eastern officials denied that. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said Tuesday the safety board's investigators also believe leaking salt water from fish shipments caused the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> jet's corrosion. Gamble said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had issued a series of service bulletins on older 737s. Those included a March 1978 bulletin recommending additional inspections of fuselage skins for possible corrosion. On July 1, 1981, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> issued an airworthiness directive requiring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers to inspect older 737s. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had supplied kits to airlines to allow them to replace corroded skin on planes, <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said. A kit was delivered to Far Eastern in April 1980, which means it was in the company's spare parts inventory considerably before that crash, but it apparently was never used on the plane, he said. <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, to attend a conference on problems with aging aircraft and was unavailable for comment Tuesday, <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> called the three-day conference after the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> incident to study safety issues involving older aircraft. One of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directives issued after the Aloha accident focuses on early models of 737s in which <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> used a cold-bonding process, in which structural parts of the fuselage were laminated using an adhesive that cured at room temperature. <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, director of public relations for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, said that about 1971, after the first 291 models of 737s were built, the company changed to a hot-bonding process that used an adhesive that cured with heat. He said the new method was a technological improvement over the previous process, which was more prone to corrosion. About that time, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> also made a series of changes in manufacturing processes and design, including strengthening parts of the fuselage and making the skin thicker where sections overlapped, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. The twin-engine 737 is the world's most popular commercial aircraft, with more than 2,000 on order. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said he found a number of differences between the two accidents. The Taiwanese plane, for example, was 12 years old and had approximately 33,000 landings, while the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> jet was 20 years old and had about 90,000 landings. He said that `` as best we know,'' the Far Eastern accident was caused by corrosion in the plane's cargo hold, while the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident involved the top of the plane. `` But again, the appropriate thing is to see what the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> conclude before drawing all these analogies and comparisons,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said.

If the stay had not been granted, he would have been the 99th person put to death since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allowed states to restore the death penalty in 1976. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> has killed 12 people. <PERSON> Giddens </PERSON> was abducted and killed after he stopped a car matching the description of one used in a robbery. He had pleaded for his life and told his captors he planned to retire the next day, according to trial testimony. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> also received a death sentence for the slaying, but no execution date has been set. A third defendant, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, nephew of <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, was sentenced to life in prison. Earlier Tuesday, <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>'s family had asked the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> and Paroles to block the execution. Son <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, said Tuesday's appeal was virtually the same as one filed two years ago, when <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> came within hours of execution. The latest petition has a supplement containing a statement from <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Soldiers and peasants clashed in the hamlet of <LOCATION> Danti </LOCATION> in northwest <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> with a rural law officer reported killed and many peasants wounded, radio stations in the capital said Tuesday. The report coincided with a plea by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> LaTortue </PERSON> on Tuesday for international aid for this impoverished <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation. He told a news conference at <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, `` No democratic process can sustain itself if it is not accompanied by economic development. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> suspended most of its aid to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> following election violence last November. Section chief <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> was killed in <LOCATION> Danti </LOCATION> last Thursday, touching off the clashes which reportedly continued until Monday. Section chiefs in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> are rural police officers with military rank, responsible for supervising public works as well as maintaining law and order. Under the 29-year <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> family dictatorship, section chiefs exercised wide powers. <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> traveled to <PERSON> Danti </PERSON> to impose the authority of the capital city of the section, <LOCATION> Le </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Borgne </LOCATION>. Peasants demanded their hamlet be assigned to neighboring <LOCATION> Gros </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Morne </LOCATION> district and in subsequent rioting, <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> was killed. Soldiers came to quell the unrest. Radio Lumiere, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> reported that from Thursday to Monday, <PERSON> Danti </PERSON> residents were beaten and arrested or forced to flee. Their homes were pillaged and burned. Witnesses interviewed by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION> said many people were wounded or forced to take flight. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> said 25 peasants were arrested. According to <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Danti </PERSON> is in a relatively fertile zone and <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Borgne </PERSON> authorities did not want to lose it. Disputes over land have become common and violent in this arid, mountainous and overpopulated nation that shares the island of <LOCATION> Hispaniola </LOCATION> with the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Last July, hundreds of peasants clashed with landowners and among themselves over property in the northwest village of <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabel </PERSON>. Dozens were killed. In asking for foreign help, <PERSON> LaTortue </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, that `` For us Haitians, economic development means ... food and water for the great majority of the population, and health services, education and housing.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s biggest foreign aid donor, contributing $ 103 million a year to the poorest nation in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, with a population of 5.3 million. Most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid was suspended following cancellation of last November's national elections because of violence, which the then-ruling junta under Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> did little to curtail. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> maintained their aid commitments to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> have withheld $ 40 million in loans. <PERSON> LaTortue </PERSON>, who spent 10 years in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> as part of his 25-year exile during the Duvalier dictatorships, criticized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials for blocking aid to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> following controversial national elections last January. He asked <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commonwealth, to make available scholarships for Haitian students and do what it could to promote <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s economic development. Dictator <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> ruled <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> since 1957. His son, <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON>, took over at his death but fled Feb. 7, 1986 during a popular uprising.

<HEAD>Chile Extends State Of Emergency</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES throughout with junta member saying emergency will be
lifted before referendum, more exiles to be allowed to return. No

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The military government on Tuesday decreed a 90-day extension of the state of emergency. Opposition leaders say the extension will prevent a fair campaign in the presidential referendum this year. In another development, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials issued a list Tuesday of 25 political exiles allowed to return home. It included several prominent figures in the leftist government of President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> that was overthrown in September 1973. More than 4,000 exiles have been authorized to return since the government began issuing periodic lists early in 1986, but only a few hundred have done so. Human rights groups say 400 exiles still are banned. The government claims the number is closer to 300. No date has been set for the presidential referendum, in which Chileans will be allowed only to vote `` yes'' or `` no'' on a single, military-appointed candidate for the 1989-97 term. Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who is 72 and has been president since the 1973 military coup, is considered the most likely candidate. If voters reject the government's choice, a competitive election is to occur a year later, with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remaining in office until then. The state of emergency would have expired Tuesday. `` By renewing the state of emergency, the government is casting doubt on the fairness of its own plebiscite,'' said <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, president of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition group. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, president of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` Under the state of emergency, the most basic guarantees for a clean electoral process can not exist.'' Government officials have hinted the election might be held Sept. 11, which means the emergency would cover at least part of the campaign. Adm. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> chief and member of the ruling military junta, told reporters after a junta meeting the emergency would be lifted 30 days before the referendum. `` If the opposition does n't like it, it means the state of emergency is good,'' Merino said. <PERSON> Genaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Arriagada </PERSON>, a leading member of a 15-party coalition organized to promote a `` no'' vote in the referendum called extending the emergency `` a gross abuse'' by the government. Officials claim the emergency is necessary to deal with what the government calls a growing terrorist threat from radical leftists. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and several foreign governments, including the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, have urged <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to lift the restrictions before the referendum. Under the emergency, which was imposed when the military seized power and has been enforced intermittently since, the government can restrict freedom of the press and ban public gatherings. It allows authorities to censor mail and prevent citizens from entering or leaving the country or traveling freely. The emergency is enforced by regional military commanders. On December 17, 1987, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declared his support for a <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> statement urging <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s government to lift the restrictions several months before the election The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> statement said that was essential for a fair campaign.

 An anti-pornography group is planning to picket videotape retailers, who plan to retaliate with boycott threats against protesters' employers, as amendments to the state's obscenity law take effect A group called the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cleanup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> plans to protest at about 50 videotape stores throughout the state Saturday to draw attention to provisions taking effect Wednesday and to urge local officials to enforce it, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON>, director of the anti-pornography organization. But video store owners are planning a countermove, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballstadt </PERSON>, president of Adventures in Video, which operates 10 videotape stores in the Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> area `` In retaliation for this picketing, video store operators are going to hire private detectives, take down license plate numbers of people picketing and find out where they are employed,'' <PERSON> Ballstadt </PERSON> said. Letters will be sent to the picketers' employers telling them their products will be boycotted because of their employees' activities, he said. `` If these people think they can walk around and express their freedoms, which they have a right to do, they're going to have to pay a price, just as we have to,'' <PERSON> Ballstadt </PERSON> said. The Legislature approved amendments this year to make the state's obscenity law conform with <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings. `` The changes technically are not that great, but they do provide some tools for prosecutors to use,'' <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Solicitor General <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. The previous law provided only for civil penalties and left unclear what role prosecutors should play in enforcing it, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. The new law provides for criminal penalties, which clearly are in the purview of county prosecutors, he said. A first offense is considered a gross misdemeanor and carries a penalty of up to one year in prison, a $ 3,000 fine or both. Subsequent offenses are considered felonies and carry a prison term of up to two years, a fine of up to $ 10,000 or both. Among its provisions, the law prohibits distribution of obscene materials and specifically includes videotapes in its definition of materials that may be deemed obscene. `` Anything on film or video is more enticing than a still picture, and this material is readily available to children of all ages and people of all ages,'' <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> said pickets will target `` major hard-core pornography outlets throughout the state'' which previously were contacted by the group and have refused to remove what the group considers obscene materials from their shelves. Besides picketing stores in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> and some suburbs, protests are planned at stores in <LOCATION> Mankato </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St </LOCATION>. Cloud and <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, he said. Though <PERSON> Ballstadt </PERSON> came up with the idea for the boycott to counter the pickets, his own stores may no longer offer the videotapes targeted by the group. A decision has yet to be made, he said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> called on Tuesday for better relations between his Marxist government and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, reminding Americans, `` Once upon a time we were good friends.'' The leader of this East African nation also made an impassioned defense of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s war in its northern provinces, charging that the rebels are fighting a proxy war to consolidate <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> control of the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. In reply to a question, <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> denied that his government was using food as a weapon in the north, where the war and a big government counteroffensive have jeopardized a massive Western-financed relief effort for 3.2 million Ethiopians facing starvation in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and Tigre provinces. Instead, <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> insisted, rebels were using `` an issue as sensitive as a food deficit situation and hunger to elicit international sympathy and support for them to promote their propaganda activities against us.'' Mengistu spoke with unusual candor on a wide range of issues, gesticulating with passion and occasionally smiling and laughing during a six-hour news conference with foreign reporters, his first since May 1986. For the first time, <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> accused <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states of backing the northern secessionist insurgency, where rebels have won major victories this year by capturing several towns. Rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> have been fighting for 27 years in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s oldest civil war. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> made no reference to the insurgency by rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Tigrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, who have been fighting for 14 years for a bigger say in the governing of their province. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government refused to impose sanctions on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> but was `` imposing an undeclared embargo'' on <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was `` at the verge of cutting the last tethers which we have to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' with congressional discussions last week on stopping annual imports of 20,000 tons of Ethiopian coffee. `` We are not really pleased with our relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and it is our hope that better times will come in the future. We want to assure them, and I am sincere, quite sincere, about this, that we will do our best to improve relations,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We have always pushed for better relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and I hope the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will reciprocate.. Once upon a time we were good friends.'' He said Ethiopians were fond of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and admired their achivements, but relations could improve only if `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accepts us on a basis of equality and respect.'' `` We are really not sure what mistakes we have committed against the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- government,'' he said, adding perhaps it was <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s choice of socialism that was repugnant to `` the defender of capitalist values. He said <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s Marxist revolution of September 1974 had improved lives of the country's 42 million people. Contrary to Western news reports, he said, and to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government insistence on categorizing it as communist, his government was not an ogre intent on filling <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s prisons with political dissidents and starving its people. Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, were puzzled by <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION>'s conciliatory attitude. They said <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> at the last minute caused <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, to cancel a January visit when it announced he would not be meeting <LOCATION> Mengistu </LOCATION>. In February, <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> said he believed <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> was not serious about improving relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Once-warm <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> deteriorated after the revolution in which <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> and a clique of fellow army officers overthrew Emperor <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continued to arm the new military government until <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s southern <LOCATION> Ogaden </LOCATION> region in 1977. In a dramatic superpower reversal, the Soviets switched sides to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> started backing the Somalis. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that rebels in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> also had won support from progressive countries, which the diplomats identified as <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which in the past have helped trained Eritrean rebels. About 2,500 Cuban troops in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> have refused to fight in the north.

<HEAD>Military Tests Put Off By Court Order; Were Set To Start Wednesday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal judge Tuesday temporarily enjoined the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> from starting tests of a high-powered electrical generator designed to simulate one of the effects of a nuclear explosion. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON>, after hearing arguments from attorneys representing the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the Foundation on Economic Trends, issued a temporary restraining order against the tests, which were set to begin Wednesday. The restraining order, which expires at noon Friday, was issued to give the government time to file a motion striking a paragraph from a consent decree the foundation contends prohibits the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> from beginning the tests. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials had planned to begin the test Wednesday with Empress II barge in international waters about 15 miles off the <LOCATION> Virginia-North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast. The Empress II barge is equipped with two diesel generators and a huge antenna system, capable of sending `` pulses'' of electrical power into the atmosphere at power levels up to 7 million volts to test a phenomenon known as electro-magnetic pulse, or EMP. Each pulse lasts only a billionth of a second, and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> maintains the testing will have no affect on human or marine life. Electro-magnetic pulse is a powerful wave, or surge, of electrical energy that is released by a nuclear explosion and which can travel long distances through the atmosphere or water. <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION> became a matter of concern to the military in the early 1960's when the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> discovered a nuclear bomb detonated at high altitudes could generate a pulse so strong it could disable the electronic components used in computers, communications and guidance equipment. As a result of that discovery, military laboratories have studied the phenomenon for 25 years in the course of developing methods for `` hardening'' electronic weapon components to withstand EMP. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> wants to use the Empress II barge to test its success in hardening electronic equipment on warships. The Foundation on Economic Trends, an activist environmental group that has long tried to curtail biological weapon research, sued the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987 with the goal of stopping all <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION> testing until environmental impact studies had been performed. The lawsuit asserted that EMP experiments could `` affect human health directly, and through the disruption of electronic circuits in nuclear power plants, automobiles, computers, airplanes, phone lines and navigational systems, can cause potential catastrophies under many possible circumstances.'' Two weeks ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> agreed to settle that suit by sharply curtailing or shutting down <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION> research facilities across the country until environmental assessments were performed. In the case of Empress II, however, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> argues it already has performed the necessary environmental study and thus can proceed with testing. The foundation acknowledges the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has finished one environmental study, but says the recent settlement clearly envisioned the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> performing a second study because the first focused on the effect of <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION> testing in the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, not the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> prohibited <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION> testing in the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has violated the settlement,'' asserted <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, the president of the foundation. `` Our attorneys questioned them on this before we finalized the settlement. They ca n't claim now that the first impact study is sufficient. And if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> says it's too dangerous for the bay, why should the waters off <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> be treated differently?'' <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>'s ruling gives the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> time to file a motion to strike the paragraph in the consent decree that <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> contends prohibits the test.

 Skeletal remains found by workers at an apartment complex were identified Tuesday as those of a young runaway listed as a victim of the Green River serial killer. The discovery of <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Estes </PERSON>' remains brings to 40 the number of victims officially identified as victims of the nation's worst known serial killer, who has never been captured An additional eight young missing women are listed as probable victims of the killer, who frequently dumped bodies in clusters in wooded areas east and south of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Estes </PERSON>, 15 when she vanished, had been on that missing-victim list until her remains were identified. Her bones were discovered Monday by two maintenance workers digging postholes at the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apartments </ORGANIZATION>, a newly built, 143-unit complex in Federal Way, located between <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, King County Police Sgt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Estes </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, was reported as a juvenile runaway by her parents in July 1982. She was last seen Sept. 20 that year along <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, a strip near <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> frequented by many of the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> victims, most of whom had ties to prostitution. She was included on the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> missing list on April 23, 1984. Ms. <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> was a Federal Way resident with prior contacts with <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> police for prostitution and theft. She had two distinctive tattoos: the word `` STAR'' on her right shoulder and the initials `` MB'' on her left hand. Her remains were identified by comparison with dental X-rays on file with the <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner's office, said <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Zant </PERSON>, medical investigator. The cause of death was listed as `` homicidal violence of undetermined nature,'' the official cause listed for all <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> victims. The killer's victims disappeared between the summer of 1982 and early 1984. Four victims were found in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, but the killer has operated primarily in the Puget Sound area. The case takes its name from the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in south <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where the bodies of the first five victims were found in the summer of 1982. The killer is thought to have picked up many of his victims along the `` <LOCATION> Sea-Tac </LOCATION> strip,'' an area of motels and fast food restaurants near the airport. Others disappeared from downtown <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> in north <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and the city's <LOCATION> Rainier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> area. It is known that the early victims were strangled. Police later refused to discuss causes of death and attributed them only to `` homicidal violence.'' The case has been described by police as the nation's worst unsolved, recognized serial murder puzzle.

<TEXT>
 Researchers studying four AIDS-infected men who appeared to stop producing detectable antibodies to the disease confirmed the finding Tuesday and said the virus may have stopped reproducing in those patients. Tests to pinpoint AIDS and protect blood supplies are based upon detection of the antibodies produced naturally by the body to fight the virus. But <PERSON> Homayoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Farzadegan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saah </PERSON>, both professors of epidemiology at the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said their findings do not imply increased dangers of blood supply contamination. `` I do n't think the risk to the blood supply is any different today than it was yesterday,'' said Saah during a news conference. The instances of AIDS victims who stop producing detectable antibodies to the disease are `` very, very rare,'' and so far have only been observed in those who show small amounts of the virus present in their bodies, Saah said. Four of 1,000 homosexual men who participated in the researchers' continuing study showed the loss of antibodies up to 3 -LCB- years ago and continue to test negative. `` Usually when an infected person loses HIV-1 antibodies, he or she is in the end stages of AIDS and has a deteriorated immune system,'' said <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Polk </PERSON>, also a professor of epidemiology at the school and co-author of a report on the study. But the four men `` had no clinical symptoms of illness, such as swollen lymph glands or abnormal counts of the white blood cells targeted by the virus,'' he added. The researchers reported their findings in June 1987, but could not determine whether the men were properly diagnosed as having AIDS initially and whether mistakes had been made in laboratory tests. During follow-up, the researchers used a new method to test for the virus rather than the antibody and have determined that the men show evidence of infection, but not antibodies to the AIDS virus. The new test, called polymerase chain reaction assay or PCR, magnifies the presence of the virus' genetic material up to 1 million times. <PERSON> Farzadegan </PERSON> speculated that the virus may go into a latent phase during which it does not reproduce. `` We do n't know if something in the virus itself is defective and causing it not to reproduce, or whether it is something within the host,'' Saah said, adding that researchers have not determined whether the disease is transmissible during this phase. AIDS is caused by a virus that attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to fatal infections and cancers. It is most often transmitted by sexual contact or by drug abusers sharing contaminated hypodermic needles and syringes. All of the men who participated in the initial report are participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study -LRB- MACS -RRB- that follows nearly 5,000 homosexual and bisexual men in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> to document the natural progression of AIDS. The latest findings are to be published in the June 1 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 Advocates for the mentally retarded said Tuesday that executing the mentally retarded, even those convicted of first degree murder, is cruel and unusual punishment and urged lawmakers nationwide to outlaw the practice. `` It has been our experience that even the foremost proponents of the dealth penalty draw the line at young children and people with mental retardation,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, president-elect of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on Mental Retardation. `` States which have the death penalty, in our view, must pass laws that make it unlawful to execute someone who is mentally retarded or to sentence to death someone who is mentally retarded,'' said <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> announced the organization's resolution calling for a ban on the death penalty for the retarded at a press conference during the group's annual conference, citing a recently passed <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> law that allows for a plea of `` guilty but mentally retarded.'' <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, a law professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> law requires a psychological examination for defendants who wished to enter the plea. Individuals convicted under the law could be sentenced to life imprisonment but not executed he said. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> also noted that most of the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> are strong supporters of capital punishment. The <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> law, which becomes effective July 1, was prompted by widespread criticism of the June 24, 1986 execution of mentally retarded convicted murderer <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowden </PERSON>. `` This position, that the mentally retarded should never be sentenced to death or executed, leaves the whole array of the criminal justice system left to deal with in any way that seems most appropriate,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> which has handled several capital punishment cases involving the mentally retarded. According to figures compiled by <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>'s group, at least 13 percent of the 66 persons executed since capital punishment was reinstated in 1976 had been diagnosed as mentally retarded. <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> also noted that while blacks comprise 40 percent of the general prison population, 80 percent of all mentally retarded prisoners are black or Hispanic. Both men agreed that initial determination of a defendant's mental capacity was vital to correcting the problem They urged states to follow the example of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which routinely tests its prison inmates for mental deficiencies. `` We need to address the needs of criminal offenders or criminal defendants from the very begining when confessions are sought, when waivers of rights are sought, `` <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said. He noted the need to educate members of the criminal justice system about mental retardation `` to make sure justice is done'' in cases involving the mentally retarded. But <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> cautioned that even with these procedures in place a number of mentally retarded defendants may be `` deemed competent to stand trail or educated sufficiently to become compenent to stand trial ... and -LRB- could be -RRB- convicted'' to face possible execution. <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> noted that there were several cases currently in the court system in which a retarded individual sits on death row. He cited the case of <PERSON> Limmie </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> who was convicted in the ax murder of a crippled neighbor in 1985. <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> said the courts should be to asked decide whether executing <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>, whom he said has the mind of a 10 - or 12-year old, would constitute a violation of the 8th Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment

 Any student who assaults a teacher will be expelled, and school security will be beefed up, officials decided Tuesday after a rash of attacks on teachers. `` The notion you have a right to free education is assumed,'' Chancellor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. `` Students who violate that right by assaulting teachers or any other school personnel will forfeit that right for the rest of the school year.'' He said students who engage in anything `` beyond a normal fight, will find themselves without a public education in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' Previously, students were suspended or transferred to other schools. The decision came after <PERSON> Green </PERSON> met with Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, the city's district attorneys and the police commissioner about violence in the schools. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said security measures at the schools will include metal detectors, electromagnetic locks, listening devices and more police. He added later that the city was researching whether it needs action by the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to permit expulsions. Just hours after the announcement, a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> teacher was grazed in the leg by a stray bullet as she left her school, but the police said the shooter apparently was not a student. The recent incidents include an attack with a baseball bat against one teacher and the injury of another who was burned when she picked up a firecracker tossed into her classroom. <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabrino </PERSON> said the number of serious incidents, such as assault, robbery, sex crimes, weapons possession and drug violations, is running about 10 percent ahead of the 3,528 reported during the last school year.

 Firefighters used backhoes Tuesday to dig their way toward a warehouse containing pesticides in an attempt to smother a blaze that forced the evacuation of 800 people. The fire at the Roadway Express Freight Terminal started about 12:30 a.m., and firefighters were still dealing with small fires and hot spots Tuesday night. The terminal itself and several tractor-trailer rigs parked at its loading dock were destroyed. Twenty people complaining of nausea and headaches were treated at hospitals and released. Two firefighters were treated for injuries from falls. Authorities quit spraying the building with water for about seven hours starting at 3 a.m. to prevent runoff of possibly contaminated water. Later, firefighters used backhoes to dig toward the fire and smother it, <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Benincasa </PERSON> said. Most of the residents evacuated from within a 10-mile radius of the terminal were told they could return home by midafternoon Tuesday, but authorities advised residents who lived within a few blocks of the burning building to stay away. Alliance, a community of 24,000, is located about 50 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said rat poisons, ant killer, two other pesticides and an aerosal propellant were being stored in the building. The terminal was used by <ORGANIZATION> Clem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> d-Con </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as a warehouse. The blaze prompted the closing of the Alliance, Sebring, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Branch </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> schools as a precaution against wind carrying a dark gray cloud of smoke from the freight terminal. The public beach at <LOCATION> Atwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, about 40 miles south of the fire, also was closed because the wind was carrying the cloud in that direction Tuesday morning.

<HEAD>Couple Face Trial In Murder, Mutilation Plot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prosecutors say a couple who went on trial Tuesday for allegedly plotting to dismember their son-in-law and his family wanted color photos and body parts to restore the honor they lost when their daughter married against their will. The alleged plot was stopped before anyone was hurt, but <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ghada </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarawneh </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, were accused of murder conspiracy and solicitation to commit murder. The Tarawnehs were arrested in February in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>. The defense contends the threats of death and dismemberment were Arabic overstatement in an attempt to frighten their daughter, who was living in <LOCATION> Tamarac </LOCATION>. Attorneys were scheduled to deliver opening statements Wednesday. Before a jury was selected Tuesday, defense attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Roderman </PERSON> sought to suppress tapes of the couple talking to a police informer. District Judge <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Seay </PERSON> denied the motion. `` Preparing for trial I read a book called ` The Arab Mind' and the contention there is that the Arab mind does a lot of barking but very little biting,'' <PERSON> Roderman </PERSON> said outside the courtroom. `` I do n't mean to say that to start an international feud, but I think, again, if you listen to the tapes when they're played you're going to get a different perspective on the case.'' Prosecutors also agree there is a cultural element in the case, the pride of the Bedouin tribe the Tarawnehs belonged to _ but they consider the plot deadly serious. `` Keeping body parts as souvenirs _ I do n't think is normal,'' said Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimitrouleas </PERSON>. The couple left <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> 18 years ago and moved to <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>. When their daughter married her Syrian cousin in 1986 over their objections and moved to <LOCATION> Tamarac </LOCATION>, tradition required the insult be avenged. By tradition the head of a family who loses his honor is no longer a man, and his family shares that disgrace. <PERSON> Tarawneh </PERSON>, 46, a gynecologist who became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen in 1980, and his wife <PERSON> Ghada </PERSON>, 44, a nurse, already had arranged a marriage for their 17-year-old daughter <PERSON> Raniah </PERSON> and refused to allow her to marry <PERSON> Mouataz </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdulsalam </PERSON>, now 28. When <PERSON> Raniah </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> with her new husband, the family wanted to send her back and sell her into a prostitution ring, according to <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Breece </PERSON>, an investigator with the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION>. The parents then allegedly tried to set up the killings of their daughter's new husband, his younger sister and his mother. The plans included instructions for the killer to hang all three people, take photographs of the bodies, cut the mother's tongue out and sexually mutilate the husband and his sister, <PERSON> Breece </PERSON> said. A private investigator the parents allegedly tried to hire told authorities about the plot and agreed to cooperate with investigators, <PERSON> Breece </PERSON> said.

 Former presidents <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oduber </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> said they offered to mediate a solution to the crisis in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at a meeting Tuesday with Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. They told reporters they met <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> is the effective leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, for two hours at <LOCATION> Tocumen </LOCATION>, a Panamanian air force base near the capital. Acting chief executive <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> also attended. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> told reporters, `` We came to offer our good offices to try to find a solution to the problem. We are doing this as Latin Americans because we are worried.'' Both former presidents are involved in the effort launched this week by President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> to solve the crisis over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking and money laundering charges and under pressure from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to quit. <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> has refused to step down. Negotiations by a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> envoy and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> representatives to have him resign if the indictments are dropped have failed to budge the general. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions, including the freezing of Panamanian funds in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have also failed to move him. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oduber </PERSON> said their mission could be divided into two parts _ to achieve a dialogue between the government and the opposition, and to resolve the confrontation between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the government controlled by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` That was the object of our conversation here,'' <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> added. The meeting took place behind closed doors, in a lounge at the air base a few minutes after <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oduber </PERSON> arrived. Details of their mission have not been made public. The man regarded as <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s figurehead president, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, fired the general shortly after grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> returned the drug-related indictments in February. But <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had his hand-picked legislature fire <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> from his president's job, instead, and appoint <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON>, the education minister, in <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s place with the title of acting chief executive. Since then, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> has been in hiding somewhere in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still recognizes him as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legitimate president.

 Friends of the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family are upset with plans to make a museum out of a part of the building used in President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination. `` Being polite, I'd describe it as either morbid or disgusting or both,'' former <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> said. The plan entails turning the floor of the former <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depository </ORGANIZATION> building from which <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> shot the president into a museum on the assassination. `` To focus on that instead of a person's life just seems to me disgusting,'' said <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>, director of the Kennedy library in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Another family friend who asked not to be identified told The Patriot Ledger of Quincy that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family members also were upset. `` They really are dismayed with this. It's such a poor idea that I just do n't believe they want to discuss it.'' <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> officials say thousands of tourists come to the building every year but can not gain access to the sixth-floor because it is closed. The rest of the building houses government offices. <PERSON> Lindalyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said the museum will contain a multimedia presentation including news clippings about the Nov. 22, 1963, assassination and the world's reaction to it. `` It's a place where history was made, a sad part of history,'' Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Conover </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, an organizer of the museum project, described the planned exhibit as `` low key'' and said it will not contain `` violent or gruesome artifacts.''

 The owner of an air cargo company faces federal charges that he participated in a $ 1 million scheme to sell a submachine gun design to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, officials said Tuesday. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wenham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, was released on bail Tuesday, four days after he was arrested. In a hearing Friday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Saris </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, he was charged with conspiracy to export weapons to the Iranian government. Saris set bail at $ 50,000 cash, which Hyatt paid Tuesday, a court official said. <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON> was expected to go to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Wednesday or Thursday to appear before a federal magistrate there. In a call to <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON>'s home number Tuesday, <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>, who described herself as a friend of <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON>'s family, said she was only answering the telephone for Air Cargo Marketing. No company officials were available for comment, she said. <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON>, 47, allegedly was present when a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> weapons designer and a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> arms merchant met at least twice in the past two years to discuss the sale of the submachine gun, called a Nomad, for production in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Herve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gouraige </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs agent posing as an arms dealer with Iranian connections tracked the deal, <PERSON> Gouraige </PERSON> said. According to the criminal complaint filed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, on May 28, 1987, the undercover agent received from one of the defendants a Nomad submachine gun, a Nomad automatic pistol, a Viper semiautomatic carbine and the technology to make them. These weapons were to be taken to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> for eventual shipment to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the court document said. <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON> also allegedly acknowledged he would receive a commission from the undercover agent when the deal was completed. The names and whereabouts of the weapons designer and merchant were not made public.

<TEXT>
 Soldiers arrested dozens of protesting students and teachers on a university campus in <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION> on Tuesday after the government declared a state of emergency to counter a planned nationwide strike. Interior Minister <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON> said troops arrested 27 people at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, entering the school after students threw rocks at a car carrying military personnel. At an evening news conference, he called the planned general strike `` illegal and anti-constitutional.'' <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Orellana </PERSON>, the university rector, said both students and professors were detained. The independent station <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quito </ORGANIZATION> said 60 people were seized. Witnesses said troops also fired machine guns, but no casualties were reported. <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON> did not mention any gunfire nor did he identify those arrested. President <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> signed a state of emergency order that went into effect at 9 p.m. Tuesday, just hours before the one-day, anti-government general strike was to start Wednesday. The strike, the seventh against the <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> government, was called by the communist-led <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laborers </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s most powerful union <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON> <PERSON> Durand </PERSON>, president of the 200,000-member union, said the main demand is an increase in workers' wages from $ 31 a month to $ 76. Labor unrest in this small Andean nation has intensified over the past two years, because of economic woes arising largely from depressed world prices for oil, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s main export. Elementary and secondary school teachers struck 11 days ago, seeking income tax cuts and protesting public transportation fare increases of 50 percent. College students have since held sporadic street demonstrations in <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION> in support of the teachers. The state of emergency permits the government to use troops to maintain order, censor the news media and ban public meetings. During the last general strike Oct. 28, demonstrators firebombed a <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION> bank, disrupted work and transportation in several cities. Dozens of strikers were arrested and there were several injuries in clashes.

 Designer <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassini </PERSON> won a $ 16 million award Tuesday from a federal court jury that found in his favor against fragrance maker <ORGANIZATION> Jovan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in a breach of contract suit. The six-member civil jury took just three hours to find in <ORGANIZATION> Cassini </ORGANIZATION>'s favor against <PERSON> Jovan </PERSON> and it's former president, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Cassini </ORGANIZATION>, 75, who designed clothes for <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> when she was first lady, claimed <PERSON> Jovan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> violated a 1978 contract to make and market a fragrance line for men and women under <ORGANIZATION> Cassini </ORGANIZATION>'s name.

He also sued <PERSON> Jovan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> for fraud. The jury awarded <ORGANIZATION> Cassini </ORGANIZATION> $ 10 million on the breach of contract claim against the company, $ 1 million on the fraud claim against the company and $ 5 million on the fraud claim against <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>.

As the primary season winds down, with the final contests June 7, the survey found broad dissatisfaction with the selection system. A majority of respondents said they did not follow the campaigns regularly and only half believed the races provide a good discussion of the issues. Sizable minorities said the best candidates generally lose their bid for the nomination, particularly on the Democratic side. Fifty-two percent of the 1,204 adults in the national poll favored major changes in the way the parties pick nominees, while only 38 percent said the system works well enough now.

 With a long history of revolving-door regimes, it is a rarity for Bolivians to see the governments they elected in the 1980s hold on for as long as they have. They are beginning to take notice. No longer do they repeat the old saying: `` Be careful here in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> _ you go to sleep with one government and wake up with another.'' Bolivians today are seeing the longest uninterrupted period of elected rule in more than two decades, and officials talk of a new <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> there is a new nation, in which a new generation has consolidated democracy with great effort,'' Finance Minister <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cariaga </PERSON> said in an interview. The country, he added, has `` achieved an important level of maturity.'' Since its founding in 1825, the presidency has changed hands 76 times _ an average of once every 26 months. From 1977 to 1982, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> had 10 governments, eight of which were led by right-wing military leaders who either seized power in a coup or inherited it from another military ruler. In 1982, severe economic problems forced the armed forces to allow elections and hand over power to <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Siles </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuazo </PERSON>, the civilian who won the presidency. He was succeeded after elections in 1985 by <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON>, 80. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON>'s term ends in May 1989, and already Bolivians are preparing for that election. The last time the country enjoyed such a lengthy period of elected rule was 1952-64, when <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> also was president. `` The profound economic crisis led the people to remove the military, who bear major responsibility for the country's political and economic instability,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Bolivian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> and first secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Siles </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuazo </PERSON> also was elected in 1980 but prevented from taking office by a military coup. When he finally assumed the presidency two years later, his left-of-center government inherited a bankrupt economy and widespread social unrest. He quickly established authority over the armed forces, discharging officers who participated in de-facto governments and prosecuting some who were involved in cocaine trafficking. Labor unions, suppressed during military rule, rose up with appeals for wage increases and improved benefits. When their demands were n't promptly met, they staged widespread strikes, roadblocks and protest marches. But despite that unrest, the citizenry rejected the notion of another coup. In the middle of his term, <PERSON> Siles </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuazo </PERSON> was kidnapped by a group of civilians backed by police and military officers. But the takeover bid was firmly rejected by labor and political groups and ended in failure the same day it began. With the economy still souring, the governing leftist coalition agreed to move up elections under pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and trade unions in 1985. <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> participated in the coalition, said the coalition had feared military intervention. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON>, in replacing <PERSON> Siles </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuazo </PERSON>, faced widespread labor unrest and a world-record inflation rate of 24,000 percent a year. But he brought with him a reputation as one of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most able elder statesmen and the experience of three previous terms as president. He enacted a series of belt-tightening measures, including a currency devaluation of 95 percent, a tenfold increase in gasoline prices and the elimination of consumer price supports. The measures set off a general strike by the unions, but he declared a state of siege and called out the troops, who this time backed his elected government. Inflation fell to about 10 percent a year, and signs of economic stability have quelled social unrest somewhat. When asked, most Bolivians say it is a strong, more deliberate citizenry and not a weakened military that is responsible for the country's political renaissance. `` There has been a learning process, about living in a democracy,'' said <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>, an economist and former <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> president under <PERSON> Siles </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuazo </PERSON>. `` With the return to democracy there was a realization of the serious of the problems facing the country, and of the need to find political solutions through dialogue.''

<HEAD>New Oil and Railway Hold Promise of More Prosperity for Gabon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY ROBERT WELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OWENDO, Gabon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New oil finds and a $ 3 billion-railway built against the advice of Western donors hold out the promise for even greater prosperity for this nation of just 1.2 million people, among <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s wealthiest. The railway, which has become the centerpiece of President <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bongo </PERSON>'s 20 years in office, runs 396 miles from this <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> port near <LOCATION> Libreville </LOCATION> through the once-impenetrable Forest of Bees to a mining center near <LOCATION> Franceville </LOCATION>. There it will soon begin regularly hauling out more manganese, uranium and timber to increase <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>'s export revenues Full operation of the railroad awaits the expansion of port facilities in <LOCATION> Owendo </LOCATION>. Adding to the prospect of increased exports are the new oil discoveries. The outlook now is that <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, whose future not long ago had been pictured as gloomy, will be adding to the prosperity that has raised its annual per capita income to $ 3,000 _ in contrast to $ 790 in nearby <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, $ 500 in neighboring <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, $ 802 in <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION> and $ 310 in the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Twice in this decade, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>'s oil reserves were reported to be running out. But both times fresh discoveries were made. The second major find, the on-shore Rabi-Kounga field, `` is a giant field ... the biggest in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION> operations. <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION> has oil reserves estimated at 1 billion barrels, but <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> predicted they will double. Production now is 176,000 to 180,000 barrels a day from offshore fields, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> said. Rabi-Kounga production wo n't begin before the middle of 1989, when it is initially expected to provide 80,000 barrels daily. The fall in the price of oil early this decade had left <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION> unable to pay its bills. But Western creditors have rescheduled much of its $ 2 billion-debt until Rabi-Kounga money starts flowing. At the same time, <PERSON> Bongo </PERSON> slashed government spending by 50 percent and cut civil servant salaries. Private employees were required to lend the government 3 percent of their salaries over an 18-month period. `` You know how the human situation is,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Ping </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bongo </PERSON>'s chief of staff `` Because we had the reputation of being the richest country in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, our economic problems received much attention. But we are still in a very, very good situation when you compare us with others.'' The country's minimum wage of $ 200 a month has attracted more than 180,000 people from other African countries to work in <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, which is about the size of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> looks favorably upon <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>. `` Despite current difficulties, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>'s oil resources, relative prosperity, economic and political orientation, and good ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> make it an attractive partner for American businesses,'' says the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy economic report on <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>. The new railroad is seen as a boon for exports. Before the railway, the only transport between <LOCATION> Libreville </LOCATION>, the capital, and the mining region was by air. Traveling by car or truck could take 40 days because roads often are washed out by heavy rains. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> refused to finance the railway project, which began in 1973, saying it was too difficult, too expensive and would never pay for itself. <PERSON> Bongo </PERSON> pushed ahead with private financing, and it opened Dec. 31, 1986. <PERSON> Ping </PERSON> said some of the projects undertaken by the government can be questioned, but not the railway. `` People sometimes do n't understand the importance of the railway,'' he added. `` Before independence -LRB- from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1960 -RRB- the country was like three separate bodies. How can you build a nation if you do n't have the feeling of belonging to a community. Countries start with railways.'' <PERSON> Bongo </PERSON> created a one-party state 20 years ago but <PERSON> Ping </PERSON> said the decision was the right one. `` We obliged the president to create a one-party government because we are building a nation. Our objective was national unity,'' he said. <PERSON> Bongo </PERSON> was 31 years old and the vice president when he moved up to the presidency Nov. 28, 1967, on the death of President <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> M'Ba </PERSON>. Three months later, <PERSON> Bongo </PERSON> created the <ORGANIZATION> Gabon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as the nation's sole political party, on grounds that the previous multiparty system had resulted in violent political campaigns and one coup attempt that failed only after French intervention. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>'s Human Rights report on <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION> says that although no criticism of the president is allowed and advocacy of a multiparty state is banned, the president's power is limited by `` the diffusion of power through 45 Cabinet level officials. ... This group of 45 includes representatives of all the country's major ethnic groups, geographic, and political groups Through this mechanism, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>'s varied interest groups are heard, given access to political patronage, and consulted on national resource distribution.'' On May 3, the government television resumed a program in which Cabinet ministers appear weekly and take questions from journalists and telephone callers. During a previous run of the show, <PERSON> Bongo </PERSON> himself was known to call in and ask questions.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After just one season on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,'' <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON> has carved out a tidy niche for himself in the hit show's ensemble cast as brash, young attorney <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>. `` I could n't ask for anything better, and that's an understatement,'' said <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON>. `` To be out of college three years and to have a job and working as an actor is part of it. And then working with scripts like the quality of ` <LOCATION> L.A </LOCATION>. Law.' I mean working with the cast. `` These actors, all of them, will give you something to play off of, and I think that shows on camera. And then the icing on the cake is that the public and critics alike enjoy the show.'' <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON>, 23, was in town recently to pick up a belated fine arts degree from <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He joined the cast of the high-rated, Emmy-winning series last season as a sophisticate fresh out of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> whose mega-ambition occasionally pushes him across the lines of decorum and even ethics. `` He's been real well received,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, the show's co-executive producer `` He seemed to fit in. There did n't seem to be any difficulty making him a part of the ensemble.'' <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON>, looking very un-lawyerlike in a gold chain, striped shirt and pleated trousers, said that's one of the main differences between himself and the part he plays. `` The difference between someone like <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> and myself is <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> has a type of arrogance and extreme confidence in himself, and that's it. Period. I think it's a difference between that and having faith and confidence that you can accomplish what you believe in,'' he said. His fast track to stardom is testimony to that kind of deep belief. Inspired by his older brother's interest in acting, <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON> began performing at dinner theaters while in junior high school. He entered <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON>'s prestigious drama department in the fall of 1982 as a musical theater major, but dropped out midway through his junior year. `` At the time, money was kind of tight. Being independent like I am, I figured I might as well go out and try to make some money, just take the chance,'' he said. Armed with publicity photos, <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in January 1985. His first Monday there, he called his former dance instructor in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, who set up a meeting that day with an agent. The agent told <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON> she was looking for someone to play <PERSON> Denise </PERSON>'s boyfriend on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show.'' <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON> auditioned and two days later got the part. `` Wednesday was my first full day living in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and we're taping ` The Cosby Show' on Thursday,'' he said `` Friday was the big shock. Here I was, I had just done ` The Cosby Show.' Coming from that high, I said what do I do now? And that's whan I started pounding the pavement, knocking on doors.'' <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON> quickly landed roles in the rap film `` Krush Groove'' with <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> and on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> soap opera `` One Life to Live.'' In 1986, he was cast as a streetwise parolee in the CBS series `` Downtown.'' The show was canceled after 13 episodes and for the first time in his short career, <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON> was unemployed. <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON> did a few guest shows, then auditioned last summer for `` <LOCATION> L.A </LOCATION>. Law.'' The show's producers, including executive producer <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> alumnus, decided to add a black attorney to the cast at viewers' request. `` I do n't feel as if he is window dressing because ... they are creating a full, fleshed-out character -LRB- who -RRB- happens to be black,'' <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON> said. `` As opposed to writing a black character who's going to say, ` Yo, Yo, Yo, we're gon na go to court now,' you know, stereotype. With the role have come attention and fame, including being named by a popular magazine as one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s sexiest bachelors. His family strives through constant contact to keep him humble, however, said <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON>. Even though he lives in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and his parents are in <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, they're on the phone almost daily. His father, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, 56, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> colonel, serves as his manager. His brother, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 26, an `` artist-slash-writer-slash-actor,'' has written an adventure-action story <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON> hopes to produce. `` Certainly, we see him as being a successful actor who has gained certain heightened visibility,'' his father said. `` But we also see him and accept him and deal with him as a family member.'' `` In every sense,'' his son agreed, bursting into laughter.

<HEAD>Strong Tony Candidates Reflect A Better Broadway Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Will the best musical be a big British blockbuster based on a variation of `` Beauty and the Beast,'' or a dark fairy tale where happily ever after never comes? Will the best play be a savage comedy about two movie moguls in the making, or a haunting tale about the children of slaves coming to terms with the past or a bizarre love story involving a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> diplomat and a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> opera singer of indeterminate sex? The competition for the 1988 Tony Awards reflects the fact that artistically this was Broadway's best season in several years. And more importantly for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> theater industry, all the shows nominated for best play and best musical are still running. The awards show, to be televised Sunday, June 5 at 9 pm. EDT on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, should be a giant advertisement for Broadway. There are a number of strong candidates in almost every category, particularly musical, with `` The Phantom of the Opera,'' `` Into the Woods'' and a revival of <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s `` Anything Goes'' each getting 10 nominations. The battle between `` The Phantom of the Opera,'' the English extravaganza by <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>, and `` Into the <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>,'' an American challenger written by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapine </PERSON>, holds the most interest. The best play competition is also spirited. The nominees are `` M. Butterfly'' by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hwang </PERSON>, `` Speed-the-Plow'' by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s Come and Gone'' by <PERSON> August </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and `` A Walk in the Woods'' by <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Blessing </PERSON>. More than any other theater award, the <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> has always helped a show where it counts _ at the box office. `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'' and `` A Walk in the Woods'' are doing marginal business and will need the prize to survive the summer. Only `` Speed-the-Plow'' has done exceptional business and much of that has been because of one of its co-stars, pop singer <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>. `` Into the Woods'' already has picked up best musical awards from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Critics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> and the Drama Desk, two other theater organizations. But do n't count `` Phantom'' out. It is the biggest success of the season, at least in financial terms, and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> voters usually go for the money. The other shows up for best musical are `` Sarafina!,'' a South African musical, and `` Romance Romance,'' a small evening of two one-act musicals. If any award would appear to be a shoo-in, the prize for best actor in a musical would seem to be locked up by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> who plays the title role in `` The Phantom of the Opera.'' Even critics who panned the musical had high praise for <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>'s portrayal of the deformed composer who lurks in the shadows of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Opera House His competitors include <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON>, `` Romance Romance''; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> of `` Chess''; and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillin </PERSON>, `` Anything Goes.'' <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> LuPone </PERSON>, <PERSON> McGillin </PERSON>'s co-star in `` Anything Goes,'' is the favorite for the best actress in a musical award. Her biggest competition is <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> who plays the baker's wife in `` Into the <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>.'' The other nominees are <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> of `` Romance Romance'' and <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> of `` Chess.'' The best actor category is the most competitive in several seasons. The category was so crowded that several promising candidates did n't even get nominated including <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Malkovich </PERSON> who gave a bravura performance in <PERSON> Lanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s `` Burn This.'' The choices are <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, one of those would-be film producers in `` Speed-the-Plow''; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lithgow </PERSON>, the bewildered diplomat in `` M. Butterfly''; <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobi </PERSON>, a tortured mathematical genius in `` Breaking the Code''; and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosky </PERSON>, a Soviet arms negotiator in `` A Walk in the Woods.'' There were n't many good roles for women on Broadway this season. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> should win the best actress award for her portrait of a ballet dancer in `` BurnThis.'' Others nominated are <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, `` Macbeth''; <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON> <PERSON> Danner </PERSON>, `` A Streetcar Named Desire''; and <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> McDormand </PERSON>, `` A Streetcar Named Desire.'' `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s Come and Gone'' dominates the featured actress category. Three of its performers _ <PERSON> Kimberleigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Aarn </PERSON>, <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> _ were nominated in that category. Their competition is <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelligan </PERSON>, who appeared in the short-lived British satire, `` Serious Money.'' The winner is a toss-up. B.D. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> as the exotic opera singer in `` M. Butterfly'' is the favorite to take the featured actor award. He goes against <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gough </PERSON>, `` Breaking the code''; <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Liberatore </PERSON>, `` Burn This''; and <PERSON> Delroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindo </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s Come and Gone.'' `` Phantom'' is expected to dominate the technical awards for sets, costumes and lighting. If it does, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjornson </PERSON> could walk off with two Tonys, one for scenery and the other for costumes for the lavish musical. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Mischer </PERSON>, executive producer of the Tony Awards television show, has vowed to keep it at two hours in length. The program will feature scenes from all the productions nominated for best play and best musical. It will also include a musical and dance tribute to director and choreographer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> who died last July.

<HEAD>Argentina Considering Shutdown of Nuclear Plant Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDALL HACKLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Financial shortfalls may force <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s leading user of nuclear power, to halt construction on a third nuclear reactor and a heavy-water plant, its top nuclear official says. Plans are being made to stop work on the nuclear reactor Atucha II, which is 60 percent completed, and <PERSON> Arroyito </PERSON>, 90 percent finished, unless financing is obtained or the government agrees to a $ 800 million budget request, said <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` We'll have to stop work on the big ones first if we do n't get enough money or obtain financing for the projects,'' Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s top-ranking female government official, said in a recent interview. A shutdown could hurt <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s nuclear industry, which is the most advanced in the Western Hemisphere outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and cut into its future sales of surplus heavy water. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> has a contract to build a $ 100-million, 10-megawatt nuclear reactor outside <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. It also has contracts to build a nuclear reactor in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and to provide enriched uranium for a small experimental nuclear reactor at <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s nuclear technicians have mastered the entire fuel cycle, which gives them the ability to make nuclear weapons, but officials from President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> on down deny this is in their plans. At one time, the nuclear program was closely tied to the armed forces, in particular the navy. An admiral headed the <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> until the early 1980s, and some reports at the time said the military favored building an atomic bomb. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> mines its own uranium ore in the Andes. It prepares its own fuel, and is capable of enriching the fuel, making fuel elements, running nuclear reactors and reprocessing the fuel. Enriching and reprocessing fuel are the keys to making nuclear weapons. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, the world's eighth-largest country geographically, has two existing nuclear power plants. Until its economic crisis worsened last year, it had dreams of building four power plants by the end of the century. `` There's no sense in talking now even about a fourth nuclear plant,'' Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> also has an uranium-enrichment plant, six research reactors and two reprocessing plants. The nuclear program is important to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, providing up to 20 percent of its electrical power, and is a source of pride to a country whose standard of living has declined steadily since the 1950s. But now <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> is the developing world's third-largest debtor behind <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, owing $ 55 billion. It also has a 247 percent inflation rate in addition to other severe economic problems, including a loss of real wages for workers. Indeed, 22 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s 6,500-member work force have left their jobs since 1983, many for similar posts offering double their pay in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> said. Neighboring <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has a nuclear-power program but its sole plant near <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> has had constant troubles. Plans to build two other nuclear plants have been set aside for the time being. Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON>, a 52-year-old nuclear physicist, took over the commission last year when her predecessor quit over budgetary disputes with the government. As head of commission, she reports directly to President <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. Although officials deny any plans for nuclear weapons, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> has yet to sign the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty. It opposes the treaty on grounds that it interferes with national sovereignty. The other non-signatory nations with nuclear technology are <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Accidents at Argentine nuclear facilities have left three technicians dead since 1982 but experts say <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> is not considered unsafe. A radioactive water spill and a burst pipe also briefly shut down Atucha I and the Embalse plant last year and in May. National reliance on nuclear-generated power became apparent in April when power shortages caused in part by temporary shutdowns of Atucha I and Embalse forced emergency power cutoffs in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plata </LOCATION> and other major cities. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s nuclear interest stems from 1950, during the first presidency of <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>. Its first power plant was Atucha I, a 335-megawatt facility built with West German technology in 1974. The second, Embalse, outside <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION> in north-central <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, was finished in 1983. Built with Canadian technology, it has 600 megawatts of power, equal to the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> plant in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Atucha II, if it is completed, will have 745 megawatts.

<HEAD>Aug. 8 Makes '88 a Special Year in Singapore</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The auspicious date rolls around only once a century _ 8 @ 8 @ 88 _ and it has number-conscious couples in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> flocking to get married on that day. Engaged couples have already booked all 90 available slots at the Registry of Marriages on Aug. 8. The registry has had to put up a sign telling couples it has no more openings. Those being turned away have the option of joining more than 100 other couples in mass nuptials at a theater-restaurant that will be staffed by registry officials. At least four hotels and six restaurants are fully booked for Chinese wedding dinners on Monday, Aug. 8. The date is auspicious because Cantonese-speaking Chinese pronounce the number eight `` paat,'' which sounds like `` faat,'' which means prosperity. Hence the belief that a date made up of all eights bodes well for the future. Many of those who ca n't marry on Aug. 8 seek propitious alternatives. The Registry of Marriages, which usually averages 43 marriages a day, reports that Aug. 1 and 2 are proving popular as second choices. The local usage of numerical dates places the day first followed by month and year. So Aug. 1 appears 1 @ 8 @ 88. It is pronounced `` yat paat paat paat,'' which sounds like once prosperous always prosperous. Aug. 2, or 2 @ 8 @ 88, is pronounced `` yee paat paat paat'' _ easy to be prosperous. Some of the betrothed want to cover two special dates. They plan to marry on Aug. 8 but delay the wedding dinner until Sept. 18, which in the lunar year, coincides with the eighth day of the eighth moon. `` Sept. 18 was fully booked in November last year,'' said <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Eng </PERSON> of the Cathay Restaurant. Millions in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> hold a deep respect for what they perceive as the power of certain numbers, particularly older people whose beliefs are strongly influenced by the traditions of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. While 13 is unlucky to Westerners, the number four, alone or in a combination such as 24 or 44, is bad news for many Chinese because in Cantonese it sounds like the word for dying. Numbers affect many things. Municipal officials say they receive about 10 written and many oral requests each year from people who want to change house numbers because the ones they have are unlucky. Applicants get a standard reply: no change is possible `` as this will result in a haphazard system, abuse and impropriety.'' Real estate agents say that if Chinese have a choice when buying or renting property, they generally shun houses or apartments with the number four. Some developers offer discounts when selling condominiums with unlucky numbers, especially if the market is sluggish. The auctioning of license plates with lucky numbers fetched the equivalent of about $ 1 million in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> dollars in the last three years for the Registry of Vehicles. Plates with multiple number eights are special favorites. If Aug. 8, 1988 was not auspicious enough, this is also the year of the dragon in the Chinese astrological cycle. Following a rabbit year in the 12-year zodiac, the dragon is considered a mighty creature that bestows blessings. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> said it expects an increase in births this year, children who will be known as dragon seeds. Not everyone agrees that popular dates have much to do with custom or traditional belief. `` The couples have departed completely from the Chinese almanac in choosing these dates,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Siow </PERSON> <PERSON> Mong </PERSON>, a retired educator and president of the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` The traditional way is to pick the proper date and time according to the almanac,'' `` Personally, I think all this talk about 8 @ 8 @ 88 being lucky is very stupid and baseless,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Straits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tay </PERSON>, who was told that all the Registry of Marriage slots were taken on Aug. 8, still wants to go by the numbers. `` It is a special day that comes along only once in a hundred years,'' she said, adding that she was considering New Year's Day as an alternative. `` Yat yat paat kow'' -LRB- 1 @ 1 @ 89 -RRB- sounds like `` everyday prosper forever.''

 `` They keep crossing the river,'' said <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Trejo </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>. He was talking about Mexican laborers and how the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration law was n't stopping them from illegally crossing the border to work in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` And people still are coming from the central and south of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> hoping to go to the other side,'' <PERSON> Trejo </PERSON> said on the telephone. He is the press chief for Mayor <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, on the other side of the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He and other Mexican authorities believe the unwritten law of supply and demand is winning out over the 1986 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Immigration Reform and Control Act, also known as the Simpson-Rodino law, even though jobs are going begging in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` The undocumented migrants continue entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as if there never had been a Simpson-Rodino law,'' <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>, director of the Tijuana-based <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and a leading critic of the immigration law, wrote in a recent newspaper column. The law's supporters say its intent is to help the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, `` regain control of its borders.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilliod </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said in mid-May, however, that the `` law was not conceived to eliminate the movement of Mexican workers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needs these workers _ not only in the farm area, but also in the many service sectors such as food outlets, hotels, etc.,'' <PERSON> Pilliod </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The law gave legal status to aliens who were able to prove they have lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at least since 1982. In doing so, the alients ensured themselves of such rights as a minimum wage, health care, and education. Those who entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after 1982 without legal documentation remain subject to deportation. <PERSON> Pilliod </PERSON> said, however, that predictions of mass deportations are unfair. `` Granted, the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> will continue to apprehend and return undocumented aliens to their home countries as always, but there are no plans for mass roundups,'' he said. <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> and others contend that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not reverse a 40-year trend with a law, because working in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, without documents if necessary, has become part of the lifestyle of thousands of Mexican families. Mexicans who go to work in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, even those taking the most menial jobs, can earn five to 10 times what they earn at home, where the minimum wage is the equivalent of about $ 3.45 a day. The Northern Border College estimates Mexicans working in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> generate about $ 1 billion in foreign income for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The Simpson-Rodino law gave illegal aliens who met certain requirements until May 4 to apply for legal status in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The majority of the more than 1.6 million people who applied are Mexican. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration officials estimate that half or more of the 6 million to 7 million illegal aliens in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are Mexican. And nobody is reporting either a mass exodus or mass deportations of Mexicans since the May 4 deadline passed. `` Just as we predicted, based on investigations we do at the <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, nothing extraordinary has happened since May 5,'' <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> wrote in Excelsior of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Northern Border College offices from <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> have been studying undocumented workers for three years. `` For them, the main factor that determines their willingness to run the risks is the labor market,'' <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> wrote. `` As long as they keep hiring, they will continue entering.'' A key intent of the Simpson-Rodino law is to stop the hiring of illegal aliens by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employers. In the toughest provision of the law, employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers can receive stiff fines and other sanctions. Agricultural employers have until Dec. 1 before sanctioning begins. Meanwhile, the crossings continue. `` The majority of those who cross here are farm workers and they've been given special considerations,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Lira </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Trejo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said their city governments have programs to help returning undocumented migrants find work and housing but so far the program have not been necessary. `` There's a tremendous need for workers in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Trejo </PERSON> said, referring to the booming foreign-owned assembly operations that have created a demand for workers. `` There's a real war going on. One company offers a 50 percent discount on cafeteria food and another offers to feed them for free,'' <PERSON> Trejo </PERSON> said. `` We want people to come so they can go to work.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Want to buy a lion? A zebra. A rhea bird? A trio of bear cubs. No problem. Demand for wilder wildlife is sizeable and the suppliers ever ready. That pleases animal dealers and customers who, for benign and not so benign reasons, go for exotic animals, even on a dinner plate. The trend bothers the increasingly active animal rights groups and others who are disposed to raise moral as well as ecological issues.

 A classified ad in a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> newspaper: `` Celebese Ape, 14-week-old baby, diaper-trained, sucks finger; also cougar & amp; bobcat babies & amp; other exotic animals.'' The man placing the ad says he had plenty of animals to sell, and what he did n't have at the time, he could get. `` There's nothing God put breath into I ca n't get,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledbetter </PERSON>, who until recently ran an exotic animal business in <LOCATION> Uniontown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` If you want a zebra, elephant or whatever, no problem.'' <PERSON> Ledbetter </PERSON> went on to say he could get a black panther, an endangered animal, for $ 2,000, but added they do n't make good pets. `` In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, there's a guy who sells them for $ 6,000 a pop,'' he says. Young elephants go for $ 20,000 each, old ones about $ 15,000, he says. White tigers are about $ 50,000 each, $ 90,000 for a pair. Cougars are $ 975, bobcats, $ 875. `` Everything I sell is cheap,'' he says. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the world's largest consumer of wildlife, trading in exotic animals is entirely legal, as is ownership in most places, subject to some state and local restrictions. That has spurred animal rights groups into intensifying efforts to regulate the industry. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbet </PERSON>, captive wildlife specialist for the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, believes private ownership is a `` total misuse of wild animals.'' About 90 percent of all wild animals die within the first two years of captivity, regardless of whether they were captively bred, he says. `` Wild animals should be ... left in the wild,'' echoes <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Inkley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Faced with increasingly vocal criticism and the hostility of animal rights groups, dealers generally have become wary of publicity. At a recent auction in western <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, a sign prohibited use of cameras and recording equipment and a non-uniformed guard carrying a holstered gun searched one visitor's handbag. People with cameras were escorted off the grounds. The exotic animal business is booming, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. An estimated 30,000 to 50,000 people in this country own, breed, exhibit or sell wild and exotic animals, says <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoctor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Prairie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finders </ORGANIZATION>' Guide, one of the largest publications in the country devoted to the trade. `` The vast majority are people who have them as a hobby,'' he says. Of that number, about 300 could be considered professional animal dealers, many of whom sell their wares through guides like <PERSON> Hoctor </PERSON>'s or at several auctions held regularly throughout the country, particularly the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Among their customers: _ A <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> couple that keep a chimpanzee, lion and tiger in their basement, a boa constrictor in the bathroom and a baby skunk in their living room _ A private game ranch in <LOCATION> Wallisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where would-be big-game hunters who do n't have the time or money to travel to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> can stalk captive-bred lions for $ 3,500 a crack _ `` a better trophy at half the price,'' says owner <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON> _ A processing plant in <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and meat wholesaler in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bruno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which sell big-game meat, including lions, hippopotamus, reindeer and eland, to restaurants eager to satisfy the latest national fad for low-cholesterol, not to mention exotic, meats _ A <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> farm that raises ostrich, emu and rhea for hides _ the latest trend in cowboy-boot leather _ A roadside menagerie in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> where children can pet everything from mice to elephants _ A tavern in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> where the owner's pet chimpanzee smokes cigarettes and swigs six-packs of beer to the delight of patrons In many places, a private owner is free to lead a lion on a leash or keep a baboon in his back yard. He also is free to treat, feed and house the animal as he pleases. Certain groups feel such practices should be outlawed because many species pose a danger to public safety and the environment. They also cite the case of a lioness called <PERSON> Abby </PERSON>, crippled at 6 months because her <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> owners fed her improperly, to make a point that too few people know enough to properly care for an exotic animal. Animals that have to be taken from an owner because of abuse or neglect or that grow too big or unmanageable face an uncertain future. `` The problem with those animals is that when they do become mean and ca n't be handled, the first thing people do is call the zoo to donate it,'' says <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickenhauser </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> Zoo. `` We certainly do n't want an animal like that. They have psychological problems and need special treatment to get them back into a particular group of animals.'' <PERSON> Hoctor </PERSON> gets upset on hearing about people abusing their animals, either willfully or from ignorance. But he says the follies of some should n't tarnish the entire group of owners and breeders who truly enjoy their animals and know more about them and care for them better than many zoos. `` Just because zoos are the commonly accepted places for animals does n't mean they're the authorities. Zoos are living museums. Breeders know what animals need,'' he says. `` People see us holding things in cages. They misconceive that we are raping the wild. We are actually the experts on the wild,'' says <PERSON> Hoctor </PERSON>, who raises lions, tigers, waterfowl and assorted other animals and birds. `` While do-gooders are making a big stink about how they love the wild, we're actually saving the wild'' through breeding efforts. Animal dealer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Troumbly </PERSON> of Grand Rapids, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, concedes there are considerable abuses and few safeguards. `` A lot of people buy this stuff for macho stuff,'' says Troumbly, 31, who operates <ORGANIZATION> Northland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. There are a lot of injustices in this world and that's just one of them. There's always somebody out there willing to sell to somebody they may not feel is qualified.

 For dinner tonight, how about gingered alligator ribs, rattlesnake cacciatore, or, for the truly adventurous, escallops of lion on a bed of fiddlehead ferns? Those are some of the dishes offered on a fairly regular basis at the Mad Batter Restaurant in the seaside resort town of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> May, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The Mad Batter is one of dozens of gourmet restaurants throughout the country that have shucked chicken cordon bleu and filet mignon for the likes of marinated grilled camel, roasted hippopotamus and kangaroo chili, the cheapest on the menu at $ 15.75. The most expensive dish at the Mad Batter is Eye of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, filet mignon with wild mushroom sauce, $ 19.50. Escallops of lion cost $ 19, with rattlesnake cacciatore going for $ 18. Even some supermarkets are getting into the exotic act, supplying meat to curious customers eager to test their culinary skills. The trend bothers animal welfare agencies. `` The desire of some people to eat exotic wild animals is a sign of decadence in our society. These people seem to have ethical blinders on when it comes to their palate,'' says <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Note </PERSON>, vice president of Monitor Consortium, which represents 35 conservation and animal welfare groups. `` It puts an increased demand upon these wild animals, and therefore it increases the removal of them from the wild,'' he says. `` There's enough pressure on these animals as it is. They do n't need to become valuable as a human food source.'' Those in the exotic meat business say there's no difference between shooting a cow and shooting a lion, particularly a lion that's raised in captivity on ranches and farms. Many people want meat that is leaner and lower in cholesterol than pork chops or steak, and they say wild and exotic game often fits the bill nicely. `` It's a skyrocketing business,'' says <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Prolman </PERSON> of Night Bird Game and Poultry in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bruno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which wholesales everything from mouflon and beaver to reindeer and springbok. `` This business was started in 1979, and it has grown as fast as people have found out the products were available.'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> of Butcher Boy Products in <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, has processed and wholesaled conventional wild gae for 27 years. Now he's hurrying to get into the exotic business. `` I saw there was a market for it and I wanted to get in while the getting's good,'' says <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, who sells full carcasses of bear and exotic deer to restaurants. `` I just wish I'd been in it earlier.'' At the Mad Batter, Chef <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellman </PERSON> says many patrons often sample exotic meat dishes out of curiosity. `` A lot of it is shock factor,'' he says. `` They see wildebeest and say, ` I've got to eat wildebeest just to see what it's like and to tell my friends I had it.''' But he says there are plenty of customers hankering for big game meals on a regular basis. `` There are people who call every week and say, ` What are you running this week,''' he says. <PERSON> Mellman </PERSON> has also fielded calls from people who are offended by his exotic fare or worry that the curried bear on their plate is `` the same bear they saw in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> zoo.'' Exotic meats are not zoos' castoffs. <PERSON> Mellman </PERSON> gets much of his meat from abroad _ lion from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and red deer from <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, for instance. But many of those animals also are raised on farms and ranches in this country. `` It started about 10 years ago, and it's growing,'' says <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a wild game wholesaler. `` A lot of these farms are springing up all over the place.'' Some people, though, have trouble swallowing the new fad _ no matter how tasty or healthy it is. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Troumbly </PERSON> of Northland Wildlife in <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, sells animals to public zoos and similar facilities. But he says he could n't bring himself to sell them to someone who wants to roast, pickle, fry or boil them. `` My feelings get involved,'' he says. `` My bleeding heart gets involved.''

 As a flock of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> geese fly northward on their annual spring migration, their honking cries arouse dozens of their kind held in wire cages and orange crates under a tent at a western <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> auction. The tent also shelters badgers, wood ducks, black bears, swans, foxes, prairie dogs, cougars and a large female lion, who growls when someone gets too close. Beyond, in several newly built stalls and pens, is a veritable <PERSON> Noah </PERSON>'s ark of animals from all parts of the globe with foreign-sounding names such as aoudad, binturong, colobus, emu, ibex, guanacos, muntjac, oryx, rhea, watusi and zebu. Within hours, the fate of all will be set by an auctioneer's gavel, their destinations determined by the highest bidder Woods & amp; Waters Auction, held twice a year on the outskirts of this quiet little farm town, bills itself as the largest animal auction east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. At its three-day sale in April, up to 8,000 animals, including birds and reptiles were sold to breeders, animal dealers, owners of game ranches, meat dealers and hobbyists with a penchant for a particular species, says <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Waters' owner <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Osting </PERSON>. For the most part, the customers were a reticent lot who shunned publicity and people trying to photograph animals were escorted off the premises by a security guard. Osting complains that the media have `` distorted'' their business by only photographing animals that are injured, kept in undersized cages or left in pens without food and water. `` The media want to stir up a story ... to shock readers,'' says <PERSON> Osting </PERSON>, 37, who's operated the family-run auction for five years. `` The only thing the media do when they print this gory stuff is to upset the humane society and the government, which is two people we do n't want upset at us.'' <PERSON> Osting </PERSON> says auctions help the wild and exotic animal industry because they bring the business of buying and selling animals out into public view. `` The intention of the auction is to clean up the business,'' he says. `` We're stepping out into the open, inviting regulation. We're saying, ` As long as you do n't regulate us out of the business, regulate us.''' Animal welfare people contend there are abuses. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Maroukis </PERSON>, co-founder of Guardians of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, an Ohio-based animal welfare rights group, says some cages were inadequate, as in the case of three bear cubs brought to the auction in a cardboard box, or too small. An adult black bear, she says, had cuts above his eyes from hitting his head against exposed metal edges when he'd try to stand, and some cages lacked food and water. Osting says some injuries do occur in the transport of animals to the auction. He adds, `` I've heard about foxes in too small a cage. He's at a three-day auction. He probably just came from real nice facilities and he'll probably go back to real nice facilities. After all, the animal is here for just three days. I think they make way too big an issue of it.'' <PERSON> Maroukis </PERSON> says, `` We've tried to work with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. They keep saying they have no jurisdiction, but if they do n't, who does?'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Castner </PERSON>, an inspector with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, says he saw some injuries, but none appeared life-threatening. Auctions are not regulated by the federal government, so inspectors for the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the transportation of animals, can only cite dealers or breeders whose animals appear to have been injured in transit, he says. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has no control over privately owned animals. When asked about a flock of ostrich-like birds called rheas with bloodied legs, which <PERSON> Osting </PERSON> said probably were injured during transport, <PERSON> Castner </PERSON> replied that the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> also does n't regulate birds or reptiles. `` We ca n't do what we ca n't do. We only regulate the transportation of animals owned by dealers. That's it.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ He's a seasoned practitioner of a relatively new, steadily booming and widely mistrusted profession in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, political consultant, did n't have an entry in the recent presidential primaries, but he has some definite views on why the winners won and the losers lost.

 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> sat on the sidelines during the presidential primaries just ended, an unusual place for him in a hot election campaign. But there he sat, like a maestro in the audience, enjoying it, making notes. `` <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>,'' he says, reflecting on the campaign that one writer likened to a demolition derby, `` made some errors that hurt him, ruined him. So he lost, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made few errors. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, on the other side, made few errors and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> is a political consultant. He is a Democrat and works only for Democrats. He also is a seasoned practitioner of a relatively new, steadily booming and widely mistrusted profession in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. One popular perception of a political consultant is that of a modern-day <PERSON> Machiavelli </PERSON> who knows how to use electronic guile to manipulate a benighted electorate into mistaking form for substance. `` Nonsense,'' says <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, but it is obvious that he feels some of the skills that good political consultants do bring to a campaign were lacking in some of the races this spring. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s, for instance. The Republican senator, in <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s view, `` failed badly in organizing his campaign and developing his strategy He did n't appoint a strong team. He tried to run it all himself, and you ca n't do that.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, he feels, would have made a more formidable opponent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, on the other hand, put together a superb organization. The campaign carried the candidate. People who run a good campaign have the edge. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>? <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> enters the fall campaign much less damaged than <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> was when he entered the'84 campaign. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is beholden to none of the special interest groups that <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> was identified with. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ran a simply fine campaign and it paid off.'' That, in short, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> explains, is the job of the consultant: to give his candidate the edge. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> is 52, trim, with thinning gray hair and gray eyes. Whatever it is that he and his partner, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, do to gain that edge they are apparently financially successful at it. Their well-appointed suite of offices overlook Central Park in one of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s classiest midtown neighborhoods. In the past five years the <ORGANIZATION> Sawyer-Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> has doubled in size from 20 to 40, reflecting the meteoric rise in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> of the political consulting trade. They even have a trade association, and it has grown from 75 members 10 years ago to 650 today. Its president, <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>, estimates that as many as 3,000 professionals in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> may be considered political consultants. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> also represents a certain coming of age in the state of the art. The consulting fraternity had its origins in the advertising agencies summoned off <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> by politicians, a practice roundly criticized in the 1968 book, `` The Selling of the President.'' In an ironic turnaround, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> has expanded into the commercial field using techniques learned in political campaigns. He represents political candidates but also <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> and a dozen or so others, mainly those dealing with unexpected market changes and stiff competition. Political campaigns require his company's complete attention, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> says, and mainly for that reason he sat out the primaries. `` We felt we would n't be able to give our commercial work all it deserves. If we do any political work this year it will be in the general election campaign.'' This election year an estimated $ 1.8 billion will be spent on politics with $ 500 million going for TV ads and $ 100 million for political consultants. For that kind of money, politicians must consider a consultants' service as something more than that of a debating coach. True, says <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, but hardly more sinister. `` A political campaign is like a war,'' says <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>. `` In a limited period of time you have to seize certain territory and hold it. It involves strategy and tactics. I work on both levels. `` The strategic team, about 10 people, are experts in various categories who determine how the candidate positions himself, how he contrasts himself with his opponents, which issues in the array of issues he believes in should be the key issues of the campaign.'' It was on the strategic level that <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> stumbled, according to <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>.

 `` Although he was very attractive, he began to be seen as opportunistic, changing his strategy. He ran as a defense candidate, then as a <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> candidate, then as a Jewish candidate, then as an economic populist candidate. `` It is very important to develop a single-minded, clear strategy. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> ended up with four or five different strategies which made it difficult for any one of them to be heard.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, for his part, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> says, `` had such great strength in terms of money, credibility as a sitting governor, and such a first-rate campaign organization it was tough to compete against him.'' Of all the contending Democrats, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> emerged in <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s view as the most electable in November The tactical team's job, says <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, is to figure out how to communicate a candidate's complex agenda, often in 30-second bites. `` Not just for TV spots; the nightly news is done in 30-second bites as well, or less. It's the nature of the business nowadays and it is n't all bad. You can express your position on some pretty complex issues in 30 seconds. `` For example, ` I oppose any further aid to the Contras.' Three seconds. ` If elected, I would ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to raise taxes 10 percent across the board to pay off our deficit.' Five seconds. `` The reasoning, the subtleties, come out in the formal debates and the print media. The electorate, in my opinion, has never been better informed about the position of the candidates on any issue and on his or her character.'' The tacticians' techniques, helped along by advanced technology including instant polling, videotape and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, are where consultants show their battlefield savvy. `` You have to be able to take advantage of every opportunity, change your strategy on a moment's notice. Often it's a matter of timing.'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> demonstrated this last year in the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Democratic primary. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s firm, like nearly all consultant firms, represents candidates of only one party. That race put him up against two others with similar reputations as heavy hitters among Democrats _ <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Squier </PERSON>, representing former Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Y </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the early favorite; and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Doak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrum </PERSON>, representing then-Lt. Gov <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Beshear </PERSON>, the leading challenger. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s candidate was <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, a political unknown who registered only about 5 percent in the polls and was given little chance to improve. Little chance, that is, until the last two weeks of the campaign. `` Our two opponents began attacking each other with spots accusing each other of all sorts of things, and both advocated a tax increase. `` We discovered, through polls, that the voters disapproved of the negative campaigns they were waging against each other. So we moved in quickly. We said in effect that they were both right in their accusations, and we pushed for a lottery that we had advocated all along instead of new taxes. `` We had the overall strategy but we needed an opening to execute it and that gave us the opening. We exploited it. Call it guerrilla tactics.'' Whatever you call it, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> is now governor of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. Could any campaign consultant's tactics have saved <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>? `` Absolutely not. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> was doomed as soon as the <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> episode came out. The most important thing people need to have is trust in their leader, trust in his judgement and his character. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> sacrificed any trust the people could have had in him.'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> was lured into politics from a career as a producer of documentary films in 1970 when he was asked to do some film work for a candidate for governor of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. By 1974, he was into political consulting with both feet. His batting average has stayed at about .750, good enough for the big leagues -LRB- clients include four sitting senators and six governors -RRB- and for an expanding foreign trade as well. His clients also include <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. He has taken advantage of every technological advance, as have his colleagues, but in his view the most important electioneering change in the past decade has been not in sophisticated technology but the ever-growing sophistication of voters. `` Americans are exposed to commercial advertising more aggressive than ever before, to expanded news coverage because of satellite transmissions, and you just do n't manipulate them. You ca n't. `` TV is like an X-ray machine. Voters can see through false statements or sloganeering instead of substantive debate.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ If you want to indulge your passion for fly fishing without roughing it _ or go to faraway places _ there are fishing `` camps'' that will accommodate you. Bring money. And that side of the sport is booming too, as this report on angling for the well-heeled shows. Last of a series.

 Against a backdrop of jagged mountains, a columbine-blue sky, and summer meadows bursting with wild flowers, a flash of blinding light. <PERSON> Myrna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubelman </PERSON>'s diamonds had trapped the sun. Dressed in a casual T-shirt, baseball cap, fly-fishing vest and slacks, Mrs. <PERSON> Rubelman </PERSON> wore her jewels as she cast an artificial fly into a classic <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> trout stream. Along with her husband, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON>, a periodontist, and two other couples from <LOCATION> Islamorada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Rubelman </PERSON> was on her first fly-fishing expedition. `` I love it!'' she said, as a professional guide coached her about the proper grip on her fly rod and cautioned her not to flick her wrist. Mrs. <PERSON> Rubelman </PERSON>, like the other financially well-off, physically active, middle-aged vacationers scattered along the crystal-clear stream, had no intention of roughing it in the wilderness. Attentive staff members at <ORGANIZATION> Elktrout </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> hovered nearby to make sure she did n't have to. The Rubelmans and their friends, <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Unger </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, are among a growing number of affluent Americans on the lookout for superb fly fishing. It does n't matter whether they are beginners or experts. They want to catch plenty of fish in a beautiful setting. -LRB- Trout, salmon, and steelhead do n't live in ugly places. -RRB- They want to eat well and sleep well while they're doing it. Their hosts must provide all, perhaps more than, the comforts of home. That was the idea behind Elktrout when <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rosa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, banking executive, and some of his friends pooled resources and built an elegant lodge on the banks of the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in 1982. At first, the dozen investors intended Elktrout to be a private haven just for them, their families, and their friends. They started buying river frontage along the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and several smaller streams near the farming town of <LOCATION> Kremmling </LOCATION>, located two hours northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> on the western slope of the Continental Divide. Today Elktrout is a luxurious log compound which accommodates up to 20 guests willing to pay $ 1,375 for five days of some of the finest fly fishing in the world. For their money, anglers cast into more privately owned fishing water than they can find at any other lodge in the American West. Elktrout's holdings include five miles of blue-ribbon <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> water, three miles of gold medal water on the <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, nine lakes, and numerous creeks with names like Cataract and Troublesome. Trout that lunge at the guests' artificial flies are commonly 16 to 24 inches long, weigh up to 5 pounds, and fight like the wild creatures they are. Nearly all the fish caught by <PERSON> Elktrout </PERSON> anglers, except trout kept in special `` dinner'' ponds, are released. Exceptions are trophy fish. A day's fishing is pleasantly interrupted by a gourmet picnic lunch at tables set beside the stream, an evening gathering around the huge rock fireplace, and afterward a candlelight dinner. `` Probably less than 10 percent of our guests know anything technical about fly fishing,'' says <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Herter </PERSON>, Elktrout's resident manager `` We provide instruction and let them discover the sport on their own. We have all the equipment they need right here in our Orvis store, and we will talk fly fishing to them for as long as they'll listen.'' <PERSON> Elktrout </PERSON> also offers three-day intensive Orvis fly-fishing clinics run by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flyfisher </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> dealer, for $ 475 per person. <PERSON> Herter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Elktrout </PERSON>'s bookings are growing `` by leaps and bounds. We're getting a very good cross section of clientele in the 40-to-60-year range. Some are older, wealthy couples, a lot are up-and-coming professionals who are intrigued by the sport, and a lot more women are interested in learning about fly fishing. We even have one lady from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> who comes here to fish while her husband sits on the bank and reads books.'' Another devoted fly fisherwoman is <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, co-owner with her husband, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, of a specialty travel company in <LOCATION> Wexford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` Frontiers'' is a 20-year-old firm that caters to wealthy outdoorsmen and women who want to experience fishing, hunting, and photography ... `` from the pristine trout waters of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> to the historic chalk streams of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> ... `` From the prolific bonefish flats of Christmas Island and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> salmon rivers of <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> ... `` From the big trout of <LOCATION> Tierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fuego </LOCATION> and alpine <LOCATION> Patagonia </LOCATION> to the best waters of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and the American West ...'' Prices per person can run into thousands of dollars. Last year more than 4,000 customers used Frontiers' services to arrange fly-fishing vacations around the globe. `` The demand just keeps increasing,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>. `` We are always exploring new areas because interest in the sport is constantly growing, particularly in salt water fly fishing, where we've seen the biggest jump in our business.''

 Mrs. <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> says Frontiers guide <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Child </PERSON> is investigating fishing opportunities in a remote <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> province, where recently she caught a fish the scientists have n't even identified yet. `` It looks like brown trout, but is n't,'' she says. Frontiers also has teamed with Trout Unlimited to open up Soviet fishing to Western anglers under a new agreement signed by American and Soviet sportsmen. `` We are committed to making this happen and we're looking at inaugurating it in the'89 season,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> says. `` We are focusing on rivers in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> which come into the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. There are fantastic <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> salmon in them, and we have about 500 people just waiting to sign up for the first trips.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> has fished on four continents and a multitude of islands. After a recent trip to <LOCATION> Christmas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, where she relentlessly hauled in 8-pound bonefish for a week, she wrote in the Orvis News: `` ... that silver shadow, swimming nose down and tail visible in 10 to 20 inches of sparkling water, makes your heart stand still ... when I connect, it's dynamite. You ca n't imagine a more thrilling five to 15 minutes ...'' If merely visiting some of the world's best fishing holes is n't enough, there are investment opportunities available in all the `` hot spots'' for fanatics who can afford them In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, a buyer can get nearly two miles of <LOCATION> Ruby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> frontage, a 3,000-square-foot log home, and a guest house for $ 550,000. In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, a luxurious fly-in fishing lodge which can accommodate 20 guests in the King Salmon area is listed for about $ 2 million. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> of Polar Realty in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, after joking that `` anything's for sale in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> in these hard economic times,'' adds that there are many smaller lodges for sale, starting at $ 150,000. `` We've had substantial inquiries and even some purchases from foreign investors who want to get into the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> recreation market,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> says. A recent ad in Fly Fisherman Magazine spotlighted a property in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> which boasted a six-bedroom, furnished estate, caretaker's house, 330 acres, `` <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> salmon and trout river Duck marsh and game hunting.'' Mere dreamers need not apply: the ad warns `` serious inquiries only.'' In the British <LOCATION> Isles </LOCATION> there is almost no public sports-fishing water left. The resale value of fishing rights is based on the number of fish expected to be caught in a year along that particular stretch of river. A 10-year average catch is used as a benchmark. Thirty years ago the average sale price was $ 100 to $ 300 per <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> salmon per year. Today the rate can top $ 7,000 per salmon on such famous Scottish rivers as the Tweed or the Spey and the Dee. Each section of private ownership is called a `` beat.'' Individual beats average 200 to 300 yards. In recent years the popularity of fly fishing has prompted beat owners to divide them up into time shares, just like condominiums on the Costa del Sol and the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>. If a fisherman expects to catch 20 fish during his annual week on a popular river, he may pay as much as $ 150,000 for his time share. That adds up to $ 6,500 per fish. Renting the same rights for a one-time, one-week fling can cost as much as $ 50 for every fish the angler expects to catch, based on the river's past performance. That does n't match the value the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> placed on one of its trout this year _ Goldie, a prized 4-year-old albino that vanished last Christmas from the <LOCATION> Ennis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, National Fish Hatchery. In a WANTED bulletin, federal biologists said that when <PERSON> Goldie </PERSON> disappeared from their visitor display pond `` she weighed more than 20 pounds and was distinguished by her golden yellow color.'' The feds put up a $ 2,500 reward for information leading to her recovery, dead or alive. Her frozen body was found in February in a snowbank near <LOCATION> Steamboat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. Federal wildlife agents say two men stole Goldie and two other fish from the government's pond, first took her to a bar in <LOCATION> Bozeman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, then weighed her in a <LOCATION> Milner </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, grocery store -LRB- 23 pounds -RRB- They finally got rid of the victim when they heard authorities were searching for her. A tip from <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and from someone who saw the fish in the grocery store helped agents track down the suspects. The government is now seeking to determine who earned the reward and may prosecute, depending on the outcome of the <ORGANIZATION> FWS </ORGANIZATION> investigation. Goldie's remains today are on ice in the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> FWS office. `` Once she's no longer needed for evidence, we plan to preserve Goldie, then display her at the Ennis hatchery with a sign telling about the Great Fish Saga,'' says <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallowell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FWS </ORGANIZATION> assistant regional director for public affairs. Now THAT's a fish story. As <PERSON> Hallowell </PERSON> put it, `` Goldie became the most sought-after fish since Moby <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>.''

 Four world-class trout rivers flow almost by the door of tiny R.L. <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, whose fly rods are recognized as among the best by hard-core equipment zealots. Money is no object for fly fishermen who seek out the Winston factory in this western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> ranching town to test cast and maybe buy a $ 305 gossamer-tipped graphite wand or a $ 900 objet d'art in bamboo. `` It's a fact that fishermen sometimes get starry looks when they first touch one of our rods. It's affection,'' says <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, who bought the established <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> rod maker in 1973 and moved it to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. `` A rod communicates with you,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> says. `` When you wiggle a Winston rod it talks back to you with a good message.'' He implied there's little back talk from a mass-produced rod retailing for $ 19.99 in a discount store. `` Our goal is n't to provide everyone with a <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION> rod, and everyone ca n't afford them,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> says. So the factory makes fly rods at an artistic snail's pace of about 2,000 a year. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> doubts his 59-year-old company will ever produce more than 3,000 rods a year. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> and the other <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION> employees do n't blink an eye if an angler wants to cast half a dozen fly rods on the lawn across the street, or buy one and substitute zebra wood for the standard walnut reel seat. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, who guided for 14 years and fishes all over the world, might even accompany an eager angler to one of the nearby blue-ribbon trout rivers, the Big Hole, <LOCATION> Beaverhead </LOCATION>, Ruby or <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>. He might even rig his favorite Winston, an 8-foot, 4-weight graphite. `` I like to fish small, dry flies. It's just perfect for that,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. Winston has no fixed working days or hours for its five regular and seven part-time employees. `` If one of the trout streams beckons, they are free to go,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> says. `` This provides them with the artistic freedom and inspiration they need to accomplish outstanding work.'' Winston's graphite rods are considered among the world's best. They are coated with a translucent kelly-green finish, and guides are wrapped with matching green thread. Winston wo n't wind a rod with different color thread for a customer or do anything else that `` makes no aesthetic sense or technical sense,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> says. There are 89 models of Winston fly rods in 11 line sizes, three actions, three materials, from 5 -LCB- feet to 10 feet long. Once an angler buys a basic <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION>, there's an enticing array of accouterments _ maybe a scrimshaw reel seat lovingly carved with a kingfisher, German silver reel banks, your name engraved on the rod. `` Our average customer has three to five of our rods and I've talked to people with a dozen,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> says Almost all of <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION>'s rods are graphite. The bamboo operation, supervised by partner <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Brackett </PERSON>, may turn out only 75 rods this year. <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION> cane for the beautifully finished, classic rods comes from mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Anglers may have to wait four to eight months for each custom-built rod, whose blemish-free bamboo strips are cut within a tolerance of one-thousandth of an inch. `` Only 5 percent of the bamboo we get goes into our rods,'' <PERSON> Brackett </PERSON> says `` We reject the rest.'' There are a lot of other good, expensive fly rods on the market from companies like <ORGANIZATION> Sage </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Teton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> & amp; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Loomis </PERSON> and Orvis. In fact, <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION>'s graphite rod blanks are made on its own tapers by <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Loomis </PERSON>, a larger rod maker. Some fly rod companies offer `` futuristic materials,'' `` superior tapers,'' `` parabolic action,'' the latest `` breakthrough'' materials. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> says a rod's design is more important than the material. `` It has to work for the type of fishing you do. At <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION>, we do n't jump on every new material that comes along.'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> says that `` a lot of the people who build fly rods do n't fish enough You ca n't make great fly rods if you do n't use them a lot.'' He himself fishes a great deal, in part because `` you almost always fish in a place where you can rebuild your spirit. When I'm steelheading at times I almost wish a fish would n't come to my hook. When it comes to hooking trout, he believes in catching and releasing them. `` For the marvelous sport they give us,'' he says, `` they deserve our best treatment. You can turn the fish loose, not like hunting when you kill the animal.''

 A fly fisherman does n't have to wear designer labels or own expensive gear to land the big ones. A trout with a brain the size of a pea does n't discriminate between <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>'s. But serious anglers nearly all agree that collecting gadgets, perusing catalogs, and spending a snowy winter's day inside a fishing equipment store is part of the ritual. Like one great beauty surreptitiously ogling another's jewels, fly fishermen check out each other's tackle with discriminating eyes. There's a genteel snobbery in showing up on opening day along the <LOCATION> Beaver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> sporting an antique <PERSON> Hiram </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> split <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION> bamboo rod, a Wheatley fly box, a few Irresistibles tied by <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> or <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Darbee </PERSON>, and a faded but much-beloved red shirt that's survived being stuffed into duffles from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, and back again by way of <LOCATION> Patagonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. In spite of sneaking suspicions that fish get spooked by red, fly fishermen love the color. Big Boy tomato red, American Beauty red, Fourth of July firecracker red. They wear it in crimson felt hats crimped at the brim, in scarlet shirts with elaborate flies embroidered on the pocket, in cherry bandanas tied around sunburned necks on hot days. To many, a splash of red is a talisman. `` CHOOSE ME!'' it says to the submerged fish with poor eyesight. `` See my bright hat? My bright suspenders? Of all the men mucking about in your watery world, I'm the one who will honor you the most. `` You, the big one there, if you pick me I will hang you over my fireplace, display you next to my office bar, maybe just let you go after I take your picture.'' Amid the brown, beige and khaki in a fly fisherman's kit bag there is usually a treasured piece of red. But an angler who wants the works will need a lot of green. If an emperor with no clothes walked into <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>' Outdoor Shop in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, and got outfitted in time to be on the <LOCATION> Snake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for lunch, this is what it could cost him: _ Insulated waders, $ 100 _ Leather boots, $ 85 _ Boot liner, $ 30 _ Fancy shirt, $ 44.95 _ Hat -LRB- preferably red -RRB-, $ 17 _ Fly fisherman's vest, $ 60 _ Graphite fly rod and reel, $ 80 to $ 200 and up _ Aluminum fly rod case, $ 40 _ Leader material, $ 18 to $ 32 _ Floating line, $ 10 to $ 30 _ Clippers, $ 4 _ Flies, $ 1.35 to $ 2.50 -LRB- need at least a dozen -RRB- _ Fly box, $ 14 _ Net -LRB- for optimists -RRB-, $ 14 to $ 30 _ Bamboo creel, $ 40 Then there are lessons: <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>' instructors charge $ 40 to teach two people for two hours, while an all-day guided session on the Snake runs $ 200 for two, lunch included. If the novice fisherman is really hooked, dreams of bonefishing at Christmas Island begin to dance in his head. That adventure costs $ 1,700, not counting air fare to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, fish are waiting in the Laxa I <LOCATION> Laxadalur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salmon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, the Spey, the Dee, and the <ORGANIZATION> Tweed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rivers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, the Bow River of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> ...

The major local asset is a theme park called `` O.K. Corral.'' This cobblestoned town in <LOCATION> Provence </LOCATION>, where people still remember what <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> had for lunch on a stagecoach stop, is where <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> made two films about peasants from the pages of <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagnol </PERSON>. But the sort of taciturn, hardscrabble peasants portrayed in `` Jean de Florette'' and `` <LOCATION> Manon </LOCATION> des Sources'' are already history. `` Of the thousand or so residents in <LOCATION> Cuges </LOCATION>, two, maybe three peasants remain,'' says Vice Mayor <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> <PERSON> Aicardi </PERSON>, who defines a peasant as one who survives only by what he grows and sells. Cuges reflects a crisis in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and especially <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. There is too much food. And big producers, who track their subsidies on computers, are pushing small farms out of existence. Seven percent of French workers are farmers, three times the level of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. But more than half are over 50. And 50 percent of that group has no heirs expected to stay on the land. The problem is partly social. Spurred by television, with good roads into town, many young Frenchmen reject country life. It is a matter of keeping them down on the farm after they've seen <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. But few of those who want to stay have the choice. `` My kids are not in this business,'' says <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornille </PERSON>, 50, one of Cuges' last peasants. `` That was my decision. It is a wonderful life, independent, not too hard. You just ca n't survive.'' <PERSON> Cornille </PERSON>, with pressed slacks and a new <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION>, is no <PERSON> Pagnol </PERSON> peasant. `` Oh, life has changed since then,'' he laughs. `` Once you could make it with 250 acres'' he says. `` Now you need 2,500. If I were 25 or 30, I'd quit tomorrow.'' Many, like <PERSON> Cornille </PERSON>, fault the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> for opening borders among its 12 members and applying complex subsidies and quotas. In 1992, borders are to open yet wider. The Common Market, set up first for iron and steel, threatens to collapse over beef and butter. Two-thirds of its budget goes to subsidize or store food and wine, much of which goes to waste. European governments reject American urgings to end farm subsidies, citing a duty to preserve ways of life dating back 2,000 years. But they also discourage production they can not sell. Cornille grows wine grapes, more lucrative than food crops. Modern farmers stick with a single crop, or just a few. Their wives, instead of churning butter or putting up jam, look for jobs. At the O.K. Corral, a version of <LOCATION> Le </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> done with ample poetic license, a son of peasants swaggered down a dusty street. Asked his name, he replied in Maurice-Chevalier English, `` Bronco.'' Far to the west, the town of <LOCATION> Ampus </LOCATION> plans to use 500 acres of farmland for a space research center and country club, with laboratories and an old-style bistro set inside giant golf balls. `` Like so many places, we can no longer live by agriculture,'' says Mayor <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Casanova </PERSON>, a geology professor in <ORGANIZATION> Nice </ORGANIZATION>, an hour away. `` We must find other ways to make our community viable.'' <PERSON> Casanova </PERSON> has found Norwegian-Lebanese interests to invest part of the $ 40 million needed for a 27-hole golf course around a futuristic campus, designed to attract a range of thinkers. Young people will learn the techniques of space research, aeronautics, advanced computer sciences and environmental science, he says. `` Half the town thinks I'm loony,'' he says. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Aicard </PERSON>, 32, is sticking to farming. He squeaks by on his 150 acres, raising strawberries, potatoes, lettuce and rapeseed for oil. His wife, <PERSON> Denise </PERSON>, hauls it to market in a battered little van. `` It's so sad,'' says <PERSON> Denise </PERSON>, shaking her head. `` Farming is the most beautiful profession in the world, and you work the hardest. But it just does n't pay anymore.'' In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Haecke </PERSON>, chief adviser to the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged that the government had an uphill fight to encourage young people to hold onto family farms. `` The drop has become dramatic in the last 10 years,'' he says. `` Farms disappear now at a rate of 3 percent a year, and the rate is increasing. No question, they're on their way out.'' As small farms go, hundreds of rural communities alter their centuries-old character. Ampus is not changing fast. The cubbyhole newspaper-dry goods store displays a tattered advertising poster on the door: `` Canadian Rat Poison. Their Last Supper.'' A clutch of old men in cloth caps by the fountain seem not to have moved since the last king clattered by in a carriage. In <LOCATION> Cuges </LOCATION>, on a wide road to <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION>, stylish hairdressers and shops full of electronic gadgets have replaced blacksmiths and cracker-barrel grocers. `` There is plenty of the closed peasant mentality left,'' says <PERSON> Andree </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikitou </PERSON>, who decided against putting up a sign in her restaurant saying, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florette </ORGANIZATION> cast ate here.'' With only three years in residence, she found parking tickets on her car if she left it on the little plaza outside. Hometown people parked with impunity. Still, she says, it was better than the last small <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> town she lived in. She recalls: `` One day the butcher woman said, ` Well, you've been here 10 years, you sort of belong. I'll tell you what happened this morning.''' But <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Santoro </PERSON>, the aging town priest who played the priest in the films, sees <PERSON> Pagnol </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> as having evaporated. `` They're not interested in that way any more,'' he says `` Kids are leaving.'' <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> wanted to film around <PERSON> Pagnol </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Aubagne </LOCATION>, but he found that to be a semi-urban sprawl. Outdoor scenes were no problem. He located an old farm in the hilltop municipality and commune of <PERSON> Riboud </PERSON>, which has a restaurant, a post office, a town hall and a total population of five. The village scenes for `` <LOCATION> Manon </LOCATION> des Sources'' were not so easy. Finally <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> settled on <PERSON> Mirabeau </PERSON>, farther north in the <LOCATION> Vaucluse </LOCATION>. But he had to pay the town to put off installing parking meters and painting white lines around the fountain that gave no water.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ In an affluent town on the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, a new subdivision features antique homes that have been dismantled, rebuilt, and equipped with today's conveniences, such as burglar alarms and air conditioning. The price tag: $ 800,000 to $ 1.2 million.

 An 18th century tavern with trees sprouting through the floorboards seemed destined to be razed in a firefighting drill until it was rescued by a couple of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> developers who look to the past to find fancy homes for the future. Now it will be restored, with modern conveniences added, and become one of the dozen or so antique homes in an unusual 33-acre subdivision in this affluent town on the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Developers <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Broom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> are scouring the countryside for other vintage homes for the subdivision they call Sterling Meadows. The homes, when finished, will carry a modern price tag of $ 800,000 to $ 1.2 million. Broom and <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> say they have n't tried to sell any yet. The former owner of the old tavern, they said, sold it to them rather than to the Salem fire department, which was going to burn it down for a firefighting drill. `` The problem is most old houses are accidents of geography,'' says <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON>, 32, of <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION>, who left a career in finance more than two years ago to become a developer. `` What used to be a convenient location on the main road is now a busy commercial district with a lot of traffic going by and they end up being torn down for a new office building, a new apartment building or one thing or another.'' <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> says the partnership has purchased five buildings for its subdivision and is still looking for others to fill the seven other lots. Four buildings are now being reconstructed at the site. A concrete foundation is ready for a federal-style home from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> that dates to around 1800. They expect to complete the development in about three years. The first step is saving the buildings, a painstaking task. The partnership has paid $ 5,000 to $ 20,000 for the relics and spends five to six weeks dismantling them. With a crew of carpenters supplied by <ORGANIZATION> Broom </ORGANIZATION>'s other business, H.B. <ORGANIZATION> Broom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housewright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a restoration company, nearly everything is saved from frame and windows to mantels and floorboards. Broom and <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> remain true to each building's original design _ which means, for example, rebuilding six fireplaces in the former <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> tavern _ but the structures are outfitted with modern conveniences such as burglar alarm systems and central air conditioning. `` When we rebuild these houses, we're using all the original features and restoring the house as best we can, but we're not building museums,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Broom </ORGANIZATION>, 44, of Lyme, whose office is in a building built in 1770 to serve as a general store for steamships on the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and the ferry that to this day shuttles between <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Hadlyme </LOCATION>. `` We're building houses that are practical to live in.'' The interiors are slightly modified with ells to accommodate the modern trappings of kitchens and bathrooms. Otherwise the homes are original, right down to the slightly off-center front doors on some. They plan to pave the winding road leading to the development and line it with sugar maples, stone walls and picket fences. Antique lampposts will be re-created, based on a design borrowed from <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` We're trying to create the perfect <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> environment,'' <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> says. `` We try not to change the details at all and take small liberties with the ells.'' <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> is quick to dispel notions that the developers are trying to imitate <LOCATION> Sturbridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. He says they confine their efforts to homes built between 1700 and 1815 and lean toward those in formal styles, such as federal or Georgian. Similar but smaller subdivisions of five relocated historic homes each are located in rural <LOCATION> Killingworth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Waitsfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> criticizes the so-called `` purist'' approach to restoration, which is light on modern conveniences and heavy on dark interior colors `` The result when a so-called purist restores a house is that the houses tend to be dark and use dark colors and that is not quite what everybody would like,'' he says. The Sterling Meadows development has met the approval of town officials, who are committed to 2 - and 3-acre zoning in order to preserve the town's atmosphere About 1,910 people live in Lyme's 33 square miles. Homeowners include former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, District Attorney <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON>. `` If you're gon na have development of that nature, you could do no better than <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broom </PERSON>,'' says Lyme First Selectman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeomans </PERSON>, referring to Broom by his nickname. `` They're as good as any and better than most.'' <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> and Broom formed their partnership 2 -LCB- years ago after <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> bought a tract of land alongside a 12-acre parcel Broom already owned. <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> says he has had a lifelong interest in antique homes while Broom quit a job as an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> about 15 years ago to start his restoration business. `` I had a piece of land I bought as a investment and I always wanted to put antique houses on it,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Broom </ORGANIZATION>, whose company has restored about 80 homes. `` Oddly enough, he wanted to do the same thing.''

 British classical actor <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> credits <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> with putting him on the bridge of the <ORGANIZATION> Starship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>. A year ago, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, who stars as Capt. <PERSON> Jean-Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Picard </PERSON> on `` Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' was more familiar with <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Paduans than Mr. <PERSON> Spock </PERSON> and Klingons. `` Beam me up, <PERSON> Scotty </PERSON>,'' was virtually a mystery. `` The role has made me part of the ` Star Trek' legend, and it's because of the actor's adage that you never know who's out there,'' he says A friend asked <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> to read some dramatic extracts at a literary lecture at <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>, and in the audience was <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Justman </PERSON>, who had been a producer of the original `` Star Trek'' television series and was casting <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>'s new syndicated series. `` Allegedly, he turned to his wife and said, ` We have just found our captain,''' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> says. `` Well, it took six months before I got the role. I went back to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and was hoping to take a revival of ` Who's Afraid of <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woolf </ORGANIZATION>' into the West End. If I had, I would n't be here today. I returned to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to read and got an offer. `` It surprised me more than any other offer I've had. I thought it unusual for an English actor to be involved in an American TV series. Certainly one with a large cult-like following like ` Star Trek.''' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> was vaguely familiar with `` Star Trek.'' He sometimes watched it with his children between matinee and evening performances at the Royal Shakespeare Theater. The new `` Star Trek'' series, launched last September, blasted into orbit in the ratings. It's the third-highest rated syndicated show, behind `` Wheel of Fortune'' and `` Jeopardy.'' The original series, which ran three years on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> in the 1960s, is frequently the highest-rated off-network syndicated show. The four `` Star Trek'' movies have taken in nearly $ 350 million. Nearly four million videocassettes of the series episodes and the movies have been sold. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> says it took some time for him to realize that by being cast in the show he had become `` an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> icon.'' `` I was unaware of the huge, huge audience waiting for this show,'' he says. `` So, I did n't share the apprehension some had.'' On a recent visit to a television festival in <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, he learned the show's power. `` I was entirely unknown in the city,'' he says. `` But one night I went with many others to visit the American aircraft carrier <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. I was immediately recognized by a young officer. I was soon surrounded by crewmen. They had all seen the show in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and their families sent them tapes. It was an overwhelming experience.'' Prior to `` Star Trek,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> was relatively unknown in this country. He was in the movies `` Excalibur'' and `` Dune'' and the TV miniseries `` I, <PERSON> Claudius </PERSON>.'' He played <PERSON> Karla </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> in the miniseries based on two <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LeCarre </PERSON> novels, `` <PERSON> Smiley </PERSON>'s People'' and `` Tinker, Tailor, Spy. Most of his acting experience, however, has been on the stage. He is particularly associated with the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He also teaches at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>. `` I was worried about this role because of the number of years involved,'' he says. `` I've always moved around from role to role and area to area. The fear was I would n't be able to do that. I'm not sure I can focus my career on one thing for such a long time. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Falconer </PERSON>, is a choreographer who staged `` The Wizard of Oz'' in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. A son is a student at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> for the Arts. A daughter is in school in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. He grew up in <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION>, in a town called <LOCATION> Mirfield </LOCATION>, which supports 12 drama clubs with a population of 11,000. `` It was a typical mill town with weaving sheds in the bottom and sheep on the hills,'' he says. `` When I was 12 I started spending my evenings rehearsing and performing. Nobody thought it unusual. It did n't become unusual until I turned professional.'' After he was cast as the captain of the new Enterprise, a lot of discussion went into how he should sound. He experimented with various accents, finally settling on a standard English accent. `` We continue to have disagreements about how certain words are pronounced,'' he says. `` I'm the director of a teaching group at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> and I frequently hear student actors say they should use a British accent for <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>. I point out that in <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s time the accent was close to today's American accent.''

 More than any other American actress, <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON> is associated with the plays of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>. From <PERSON> Josie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, the big-hearted farm woman in `` A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' to the sensual <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Putman </PERSON> in `` Desire Under the Elms,'' to the murderous <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mannon </PERSON> in `` Mourning Becomes Electra,'' she has left her mark on some of <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s most memorable characters. Now Broadway is getting a double dose of <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON> and <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON> currently is appearing in two of <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s best plays _ `` Long Day's Journey into Night,'' considered his masterpiece, and `` Ah, Wilderness!,'' the author's only comedy, a gentle, genial tale of innocence lost. The plays, which also star <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Robards </PERSON>, are running in repertory at the <LOCATION> Neil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Simon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION> as part of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>. `` I always say that I am not an <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> expert,'' the actress explained recently before a performance here where the two <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> Repertory Theater productions were polished before moving to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I feel all I really know are his women.'' And <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON> gets to play one of <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s greatest in `` Long Day's Journey into Night,'' the playwright's exorcism of his own devastating family life. It is directed by another <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> master, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>. She stars as <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON>, a tragic, drug-addled woman who was modeled after <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s own mother. `` <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s women have great passion, a passion for life,'' she says. `` Nothing is done half-way. It's not little tiny things that happen to them. These plays are not about the day you cracked up the car and did n't know how to explain it. `` Literally, what these women do affects everything around them. What they do can not be taken back. It ca n't be erased or not remembered. In each one of his plays, it changes life's course.'' For <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON>, what changed her career and forever stamped her as an O ` <PERSON> Neill </PERSON> actress was the 1973 revival of `` A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' which also starred <PERSON> Robards </PERSON> and also was directed by <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>. It was a production that almost did n't happen. `` We were all busted,'' she recalls. `` <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> had just come out of an auto accident. I had no money, and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> had just risen up sober. Someone said, ` Put something together and go out and do summer stock,' thinking we would do a comedy.'' <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> suggested `` A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' a play he and <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON> first did 15 years earlier at the <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Festival </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The only producer who would take them was <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Migatz </PERSON> who ran a small summer theater at a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> girls' college in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Just before the contracts were signed, <PERSON> Migatz </PERSON> was struck by a car and killed `` It was on the point of being canceled, but his board came forward and said they would pay us if we would go into rehearsal,'' <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON> said. The result was the most memorable <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> production of the decade. When the play came to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> the following December, it was cheered by critics and audiences. And <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON> won a best-actress <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> for her portrait of <PERSON> Josie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>. `` I said at the time that I was n't going to do any more O ` <PERSON> Neill </PERSON>,'' she says. <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON> did n't want to be labeled as an actress who only did <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> plays. `` Compounding it was my doing ` My Gene,''' she says, referring to her one-woman show, written by <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelb </PERSON>, about the life of <LOCATION> Carlotta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s exotic wife. `` I thought, ` Well, that covers them all. What more can I do?''' The idea for these latest productions was born 10 years ago, when a group of actors, writers and producers got together at <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cristo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cottage </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s boyhood home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. The actors, including <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, read excerpts from <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> plays. It was agreed to mount a production of `` Long Day's Journey into Night'' in 1988, the 100th anniversary of <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s birth. `` My mentality is that I'm lucky if I know what I'm doing tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON> laughs. `` So forget 10 years from now. But it came.'' It was <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> _ again _ who had the idea of alternating performances of `` Long Day's Journey'' and `` Ah, Wilderness!'' `` We were going to show the two sides of <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, the dream family and the real family,'' <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON> says. `` The way to view the plays is to see ` Long Day's Journey' first and ` Ah, Wilderness!' second. Then you understand the second play. Although it's a comedy and sweet and beautifully written, it is given an added depth and becomes very touching.'' For <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON>, the two O ` <PERSON> Neill </PERSON> plays are only part of her professional life. She also is president of Actors Equity, the actors union. It's a job she has held since 1985 and now is running unopposed for re-election. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Burstyn </PERSON>, a former president, had talked her into running for the Actors Equity council. When <PERSON> Burstyn </PERSON> left the presidency, she persuaded <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON> to run for the top office. `` I really have a great affection for actors as a group,'' <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON> says. `` I find them very courageous. It's a profession of rejection.'' <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON> embraced the union job like she did acting on stage _ wholeheartedly. `` I'm not an office person and yet I did n't want to be a figurehead,'' says the woman who also serves on countless other boards and committees including the Actors Fund of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and Save the Theaters, which works for the preservation of Broadway playhouses. <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON> has been able to separate her numerous jobs, even when she is doing a play as difficult, dark and demanding as `` Long Day's Journey into Night.'' `` I have no feeling about dragging shows behind me like chains,'' <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON> says. `` If a heavy show goes well, you come off stage feeling terrific. I do. I've gotten rid of all the horrors that are around for the day, the week, the year, the life. They have just been dropped out there. They're now the audience's.''

 <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON>'s beginnings on the comedy trail may well have started when his father took him to see <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> in `` The Nutty Professor'' at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> movie house. `` I remember the theater, the seat, everything,'' he says. `` Boy, I just thought that it was the greatest movie ever made. It may very well have been; I still feel that way when I watch it on videotape. `` I remember me and my dad and my brother watching the movie and seeing <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> go into his character which I'm sure influenced me in later comedy years,'' said <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> as he did a <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> imitation. `` Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> directed that, too.'' Twenty-five years later, <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> is riding high: television specials, concerts -LRB- `` The Momentary Madness Tour'' -RRB-, a book -LRB- `` The Piscopo Tapes'' -RRB-, constant exposure on commercials -LRB- Miller Lite -RRB- and movies. The latest is `` Dead Heat,'' in which he and <ORGANIZATION> Treat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> do battle with a gang of thugs who wo n't die. You might think that the intense <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and the loose <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> would make an incongruous couple both on and off the screen. `` Treat was great,'' the comedian said. `` Treat's got as sick a sense of humor as I do, and it was wild. Between takes and everything, we had a great time. Treat worked very hard on this film; he had a lot of makeup he had to get in _ eight hours of makeup for certain scenes. `` For some reason we both did silly things _ like <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> impressions throughout the movie. When we got punchy, we started doing <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> back and forth; it kept us going. It's very important to be on the same wave length on a picture like this.'' `` Dead Heat'' has had a lukewarm reception from both critics and audiences, and it appears that <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> has n't quite found himself in films. Oddly, his first three roles have been crime-oriented: a wacky hit man in the gangster spoof, `` Johnny Dangerously'' which starred <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON>; a mob errand boy with <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON> `` Wise Guys.'' Neither lighted up the box-office charts. <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> observed that graduates of `` Saturday Night Live'' follow two courses in their film careers: they either arrive with a bang such as the late <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Belushi </PERSON> and comedian <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>; or, they have a slow buildup to the top such as <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Aykroyd </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> figures he's in the latter category. The <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> story began 36 years ago in <LOCATION> Passaic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where his father was a lawyer. The comic majored in surfing throughout much of his school life, but managed to earn a degree in broadcasting at <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. He worked as a disc jockey and dinner theater actor, but his comedy career really began when he started performing at the Improvisation in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The `` Saturday Night Live'' producers liked his stuff and signed him in 1980. `` It was pretty devastating,'' <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> recalled. `` I had been doing very well at the Improv and with television commercials. On ` Saturday Night Live' we had to replace <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Aykroyd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Radner </PERSON>, and it was an impossible task. The show in its first year was an abomination, real bad. `` Then it started to get exciting, when I realized we were doing stuff that was good as ever.'' The turning point may have come at a cast meeting when a producer with spray paint emblazoned `` Danger'' on a blank wall. <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> followed the instruction, stretching his own talent, and sometimes good taste, to the utmost. He has portrayed so many characters that you wonder if the real <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> will ever stand out. He admitted that such portrayals may constitute a device: `` Not liking one's self, being insecure. It's true. I feel the most comfortable doing characters, like in the beer commercials. `` I liked ` Dead Heat' because I was myself for the first time,'' he said. `` And I found myself feeling feeling comfortable. Lately I've been working out and staying physically fit, and I feel more confidence with myself.'' Seeing him portray the late martial arts king <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> in the commercials, you might think he's wearing a body suit. Those muscles are all <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON>'s. `` A lot of people thought I was wearing prosthetics,'' he said. `` I've been working for 2 -LCB- years. I do it for my head. The muscles are a residual result. `` I want to do it for three or four more years, and then I'll just be one of those guys who swims every day.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ```Crocodile' Dundee II''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 `` ` Crocodile' Dundee II'' is that rare bird: a sequel that excels the original. Mind you, the new film will not have the impact of `` ` Crocodile' Dundee I,'' which introduced us to one of the great character creations of film history. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Dundee </PERSON> was a masterpiece, more credible than <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, more charming than <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, funnier than Rambo. The second coming of <ORGANIZATION> Dundee </ORGANIZATION> finds him shacked up with <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozlowski </PERSON> -RRB- in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> penthouse, enjoying his leisure. Not for long. Before he is murdered in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, Sue's former husband -LRB- <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Boutsikaris </PERSON> -RRB- sends her photographs incriminating a drug baron -LRB- <PERSON> Hechter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ubarry </PERSON> -RRB- The powerful dopester and his vicious lieutenant -LRB- <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> -RRB- kidnap Sue and attempt to recover the photos. <ORGANIZATION> Dundee </ORGANIZATION> to the rescue, accompanied by various street types. The siege of the Colombian's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> castle is <PERSON> Capra </PERSON> corn of the best vintage. To escape their pursuers, <ORGANIZATION> Dundee </ORGANIZATION> and Sue flee to his homeland enjoying a reunion with his pub pals. The hoods follow, of course, kidnaping bumbling <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Meillon </PERSON> -RRB- and gathering some local toughs to track down <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> and Sue. But the villains are no match for the wilderness-wise <ORGANIZATION> Dundee </ORGANIZATION>. Only in the latter stages does the filmmakers' imagination falter. Our hero's devices seem a bit labored, especially in the assault of the bats. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> remains true to the `` Crocodile'' image, which is expectable since he wrote the script with his son, <PERSON> Brett </PERSON>. Happily they reversed the locales, and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> portion comes first, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> last. In the first movie, the Australian sequences were far more interesting than the familiar plot of a hick in the big city. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>'s longtime partner, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornell </PERSON>, directed `` ` Crocodile' Dundee II'' and produced with <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> He draws good performances from the cast, especially the heavies <PERSON> Ubarry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, who are delightfully evil, and <PERSON> Meillon </PERSON>, a kind of down under <PERSON> Smiley </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnette </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kozlowski </PERSON> has little to do but be supportive and frightened, and she does both with great skill. It is both sorrowful and heartening to learn that <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> plans to retire <ORGANIZATION> Dundee </ORGANIZATION> forever. He will be sorely missed. But do we really need to see `` ` Crocodile' Dundee Goes to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>,'' etc.? The Paramount release is rated PG, with not much content that would harm children. Running time: 111 minutes.

 Academy Award-winning actress <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> cornered the home exercise market six years ago with the video version of her best-selling book, `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s Workout.'' As of January, it has made $ 37.8 million. She has seven other exercise videos out, four in the Top 10 selling videocassettes, according to Billboard magazine. All are released by <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> and have turned flab into fat city for <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> and friends. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> may be the home video exercise empress, but she's not the only game in town.

Led by dancer <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> and featuring MS victims including <PERSON> Jimmie </PERSON> <PERSON> Heuga </PERSON>, the video is divided into three sections: a warm-up of slow neck, back, leg and arm stretches; easy calisthenics; a slow cool-down to relax the body. Some of the participants sit on chairs or stools while they exercise. A ballet barre is handy for extra support. `` The program was designed with the assistance of an advisory committee which was eager to see to it that the video was sensitive to the broad spectrum of needs of ambulatory persons with MS and other neurological diseases, and they selected exercises that contribute to the improvement of balance and coordination,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurzig </PERSON>, executive director of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> chapter. MS is a chronic, often crippling disease of the central nervous system. Its symptoms can include numbness, sexual dysfunction, difficulty with coordination, loss of balance and weakness. `` The MS Workout'' cost $ 15 and can be ordered from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> MS chapter. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> exercise tapes are available in most video retail outlets. According to <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> they include `` Start Up With <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>,'' which was released in March and has sold 781,659 copies; `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s Low Impact Aerobic Workout,'' with $ 23.3 million in sales; `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s New Workout,'' with $ 25.2 million in sales; `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s Easy Going Workout,'' $ 11.1 in sales; and `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s Workout With Weights,'' `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s Pregnancy, Birth and Recovery'' and `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s Workout Challenge.

 `` The Principal'' -LRB- RCA @ <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> Home Video; VHS @ Beta, $ 89.95; Rated R -RRB- In `` The Principal,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Belushi </PERSON> plays a Rambo-like high school teacher who drinks too much, smashes Porsches with baseball bats and generally ticks off his bosses at the stuffy old board of education. Instead of firing him, they decide to `` reward'' him with a principalship. Trouble is, it's at <ORGANIZATION> Brandel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, the low-down dirtiest, most crime-infested, drug-ridden school on the planet. The film misses no opportunity for gratuitous violence. The kids do n't just taunt or ignore him _ they beat him to a bloody pulp. The teachers are assaulted. And in finest spaghetti Western fashion, <PERSON> Belushi </PERSON>, riding his motorcycle into the very halls of Brandel, is going to tame this here school, pard-ner. There is a climactic chase scene and showdown in the girl's shower _ this film's ludicrous version of the OK Corral Even a graduate of Brandel could predict the outcome of this absurd, boring, exploitative movie. And even a better actor than <PERSON> Belushi </PERSON> could have done little with such pea-brained dialogue as this sample when he tries to inspire downtrodden teachers: `` Aw, come on, you people,'' says he, his voice rising Patton-like. `` You ca n't pick and choose your students.'' The film also features <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, muttering unintelligible cynicisms as the school's security guard. Tough schools lately seem to have caught <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s fancy. Unfortunately, it is only the rare film, such as the excellent `` Stand and Deliver,'' that manages not to succumb to sexploitation or racist, blackboard jungle caricatures. `` The Principal,'' rated `` R,'' contains the foul, street-language you'd expect in a film such as this. But not to worry. The rest of the dialogue will probably put you to sleep. _ By <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitgang </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> Education Writer.

 `` Jacknifed'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Beauvoir </PERSON> In his 26 years, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Beauvoir </PERSON> has packed wildly diverse experiences onto his musical resume, including stints with the doo-wop Flamingoes, shock punkers Plasmatics and <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Steven </PERSON>'s political Disciples of Soul Even <PERSON> Beauvoir </PERSON>'s appearance paints him as a musical maverick with the wild, white Mohawk he's sported for many years. This personal history hardly prepares a listener for the musical conservatism of `` Jacknifed,'' <PERSON> Beauvoir </PERSON>'s second solo album. `` Jacknifed'' is a soulful contemporary dance album, probably the first to be influenced by the success of <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Arby </PERSON>. The keyboards and guitars simmer but do n't sizzle, leaving room for <PERSON> Beauvoir </PERSON>'s songs to stretch and breathe. Both lyrically and musically, <PERSON> Beauvoir </PERSON> has the smarts to avoid tired cliches. He also avoids anything distinctive that will get his songs noticed. `` Jacknifed'' is the type of record that would float by on the radio without causing any real reaction. Many of the songs, such as `` Standing on My Own Two Feet'' and `` Find My Way Home'' tread familiar themes of a solitary man trying to find his way in a hostile world. <PERSON> Beauvoir </PERSON>, who wrote and produced the album along with playing most of the instruments, has obvious talent. He's still looking for the best way to show the world.

 `` The Story of the Clash, Vol. 1'' -LRB- Epic -RRB- _ The Clash They once advertised themselves as `` the only band that matters.'' One member of the group was fired for political reasons. The band's first hit single was n't even listed on the cover of the `` London Calling'' album. Who are the Clash? This once-important band dropped so quickly from the public consciousness it almost seems like they've become a trivia question. The time is ripe for a retrospective, and <ORGANIZATION> Epic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> has obliged with the two-record `` The Story of the Clash, Vol. 1.'' Liking or hating the Clash during their brief prime in the late 1970s and early'80s was almost a political statement in itself. Punk rock set up two hostile camps, one that loved the brash young toughs challenging the musical establishment, the other threatened by them. The band's aggressive working-class politics also left little room for neutrality. This often obscured the simple fact the Clash was a terrific rock band, one that quickly grew past the limitations of primitive punk but never lost the creative spark that went with it. The retrospective, while put together rather haphazardly, makes that point abundantly clear. The set cuts a wide swath through the glorious trash rock of `` Should I Stay or Should I Go,'' the Motown tribute `` Train in Vain,'' the mainstream rock crunch of `` <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Calling,'' the inspirational near ballad `` Stay Free'' and the adrenalin kick of `` <PERSON> Janie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>.'' Oddly, the record only includes two cuts from the sprawling three-record `` Sandinista.'' Cuts such as the title track or `` Charlie Do n't Surf'' would have been better than the subpar `` Straight to Hell'' included here from `` Combat Rock.'' The record does n't run chronologically. Side 3 is a tribute to the Clash's infancy and side one sounds like a prototype for <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' subsequent Big Audio Dynamite group, but the sequencing often seems random. If not, it would have been preferable to hear the band explain it through retrospective liner notes, instead of the rambling reminiscence of a roadie included here. Still, this is an illuminating trip through a time capsule and would make an especially worthy purchase for those who missed the Clash the first time around.

On ` Saturday Night Live' we had to replace <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Aykroyd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Radner </PERSON>, and it was an impossible task. The show in its first year was an abomination, real bad. `` Then it started to get exciting, when I realized we were doing stuff that was good as ever.'' The turning point may have come at a cast meeting when a producer with spray paint emblazoned `` Danger'' on a blank wall. <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> followed the instruction, stretching his own talent, and sometimes good taste, to the utmost. He has portrayed so many characters that you wonder if the real <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> will ever stand out. He admitted that such portrayals may constitute a device: `` Not liking one's self, being insecure. It's true. I feel the most comfortable doing characters, like in the beer commercials. `` I liked ` Dead Heat' because I was myself for the first time,'' he said. `` And I found myself feeling feeling comfortable. Lately I've been working out and staying physically fit, and I feel more confidence with myself.'' Seeing him portray the late martial arts king <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> in the commercials, you might think he's wearing a body suit. Those muscles are all <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON>'s. `` A lot of people thought I was wearing prosthetics,'' he said. `` I've been working for 2 -LCB- years. I do it for my head. The muscles are a residual result. `` I want to do it for three or four more years, and then I'll just be one of those guys who swims every day.

<HEAD>The Artists: Phillips Collection Remains Great Art Viewing</HEAD>

 Growing up in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in the 1920s, <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> had the paintings of <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Auguste </PERSON> <PERSON> Renoir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Degas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Monet </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON> and many more for company. `` My father so much wanted other people to enjoy them that already in 1921, three years before I was born, he opened two rooms to the public,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> recalled. `` That was how our house became the first museum of modern art in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The Phillips Collection is still on public display in the home his parents owned on 21st Street near Dupont Circle until it got so big that they had to leave their art work and move. The outstanding assembly of mostly late 19th century and 20th century paintings was acquired by <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, who inherited wealth from banking and steel, and his wife <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON>, who was a well-known landscape and still-life painter. Their son, <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON>, 63, a tall, quiet-spoken retired diplomat, is director of the collection, which now belongs to a foundation. Seventy-six of the 2,000 paintings are at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hayward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> through Aug. 14, and then go to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> in the collection's first European show after having exhibitions in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The highlight is <PERSON> Renoir </PERSON>'s large, colorful `` The Luncheon of the Boating Party,'' painted in 1881 after a good lunch at a river restaurant, with convivial chatter and pretty women. `` It's <PERSON> Renoir </PERSON>'s masterpiece, the finest thing he ever did,'' said exhibition organizer <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lampert </PERSON>, a Washingtonian who now lives in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. She was about 2 years old when her father first took her to see the Phillips Collection. The dazzling <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> show starts with <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Greco </PERSON> in the 16th century and ends with modern abstracts by <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Scully </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. There are <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Goghs </PERSON>, a `` Blue Period'' <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> and works by <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wassily </PERSON> <PERSON> Kandinsky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Klee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Amedeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Modigliani </PERSON>, <PERSON> Piet </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondrian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Winslow </PERSON> <PERSON> Homer </PERSON>. The trustees still acquire pictures but focus mainly on conservation, improving the museum buildings and education, helped by exhibition fees. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said his father became interested in art at college. `` He wrote about the history of art and tried to interpret what artists say on their canvases. He gave that up later, I think because of the difficulty of talking about abstract art,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. They would bring new paintings home to `` test'' them, and would send them back if they decided against them, he recalled. If they decided against them, they would go back to the dealers. `` My parents had remarkable taste and discernment and my father did n't follow any fashion and often paid just a few hundred dollars for a painting.'' Artists visited the family. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> remembers meeting the photographer <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Stieglitz </PERSON>, `` a fierce-looking man with hair growing from his ears and huge eyebrows and steel glasses. He expanded my father's taste.'' <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' taste shifted and evolved, but he was particularly fond of one painting now at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> show _ <PERSON> Honore </PERSON> <PERSON> Daumier </PERSON>'s `` The Uprising,'' showing a young man, arm outflung in a crowd. It may have been inspired by the 1848 revolution in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said his father `` saw it as a symbol of man's aspirations and discontent.'' `` My father did n't have great wealth, but he felt he had inherited a lot and was going to give it back through his museum.'' His father also painted for a while. `` He went into rages when he could n't get the color mix he could see in his mind. He put oil paints on top of each other and they turned to mud,'' he recalled. `` Dad would take mother to baseball, to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Senators _ he watched and she sketched. One of her famous paintings is of a baseball game.'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said likes the way the <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> has blended American and French pictures. `` My father loved that,'' he said. `` He said there should be no national boundaries in art. Art was independent of nationality. Artists were kindred spirits who spoke to each other, not only across national boundaries but from century to century.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Brian Setzer Wants His Fans Back</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON> is sure people will like his new record. But he's not sure how many will hear it. <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON> was the guitarist for the Stray Cats, a rockabilly trio that had a number of hits in the early part of the decade. But his first solo album, `` This Knife Feels Like Justice,'' released in 1986, sold poorly despite good reviews. `` It would have been a platinum album for someone else,'' <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON> said. `` I was really trying to get way from being a Stray Cat. I do n't think I left enough of me in there.'' With the release of `` Live Nude Guitars,'' <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON> is hoping to win back some old fans and make some new ones. `` I do n't think I've found my own audience yet,'' he said. `` I think I've got to play on the road a lot and develop. I'm going to get some crossover people who are just fans of the Stray Cats and kids who are curious. `` I think this new record is really focusing in on who I am. If I just get out there and play and show them a great show, I'll get a following.'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, known for his work with the Pretenders and the Sex Pistols, and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of Eurythmics each produced songs on the album. Fans of such Pretenders songs as `` Brass in Pocket'' and `` Talk of the Town'' will recognize the guitar sound on `` Every Tear That Falls.'' `` It is very ` Pretendersy,''' said <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON>. `` He -LRB- Thomas -RRB- layers on guitars after guitars and gets a big sound out of it.'' `` Every Tear That Falls'' was written with the <ORGANIZATION> Everly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> in mind but <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON> decided to record it himself. `` I kind of had this riff and I thought, ` Oh boy, would n't it be great to write this song for the <ORGANIZATION> Everly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, that kind of harmony thing,''' <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON> said. `` I know -LRB- <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> wrote one -LRB- ` Wings of a Nightingale' -RRB- for them. So I came up with this but I liked it so much I kept it.'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> produced `` Rockability,'' <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON>'s favorite song on the album. `` It's sort of a year-2000 rockabilly song,'' <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON> said. `` I want to make a ` pyschobilly' album with lots of echo and distortion.'' <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON> was happy with both <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, although he found their styles very different. `` Working with <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> is instant,'' <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON> said. `` He hears something he likes, knows it's good and just cuts it and it's done Working with <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> takes a long time but the end result is equally as pleasing. `` I like working with both of them but I'm doing the next record with <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> also produced `` The Rain Washed Everything Away,'' a big ballad in the tradition of <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitney </PERSON> or the <ORGANIZATION> Righteous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>. The song was co-written by <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON> at <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>'s house. `` <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> says, ` Let's write one of those ballads. Let's go out on the porch, that will give us a title,''' <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON> said. `` We get out on the porch and he says, ` Oh, it's a beautiful night,' and I say, ` Yeah, the rain washed everything away,' and he says, ` There's the title.' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Righteous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> would clean this up.'' Although the 28-year-old <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON> was born after the first wave of rock' n' roll hit in the 1950s, he has always preferred the music of that period. `` When I was going to high school, even though it was the'70s, it was still the leftover of the'60s. It was hippie; the flower thing,'' <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON> recalled. `` I never connected with it. I had long hair but when I was about 15, I just cut it all off. `` I wanted to look like <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> rather than <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON> still idolizes <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, who was killed in a car crash in 1960: `` Everything about <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> spoke rock' n' roll to me.'' He covers a Cochran hit, `` Nervous Breakdown,'' on the new album and portrayed him last year in the hit movie, `` La Bamba,'' the story of <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> <PERSON> Valens </PERSON>, another early rock star who died in a plane crash in 1959 with <LOCATION> Buddy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Holly </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> `` Big Bopper'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>. `` I got a good feeling like I was the only one who could do it,'' <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON> said. `` I was just me in the role.'' But <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON> has no intentions of pursuing a film career. `` I do n't enjoy acting. People strive their whole lives to be actors. I do n't think someone should fall into it,'' <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON> said. `` I liked playing my hero but I just do n't feel I deserve to be an actor.'' <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON> wants to introduce a new generation to <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> and other rockers from the'50s. `` Most kids just turn on <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Music Television -RRB- and they see what they like,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>, they're not around any more. That's why I'm here. Those people ca n't speak to those kids. I have to.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: The Eclectic Margaret Atwood</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Writer <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>'s interests range far and wide, from history to Siamese twins to former TV evangelists <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. So extensive and eclectic is her knowledge that she can talk about literature in the years following the American Revolution and also tell you which states have the highest populations of porcupines. Although best known for her highly acclaimed novel, `` The Handmaid's Tale,'' <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> first gained recognition for her poetry. Her `` Selected Poems II: Poems Selected and New 1976-86'' has just been released by <ORGANIZATION> Houghton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mifflin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paperbacks </ORGANIZATION>. There are poems about love and Siamese twins, and poems about poets. `` There's a perception of their social role,'' she said about her fellow poets. `` It was n't always that way but now people think you ca n't be a poet without being drunk. Women poets are expected to commit suicide. Someone once asked me when, not if, I would commit suicide. `` I prefer to live, thank you very much.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 From `` The Words Continue Their Journey,'' a selection from 1984's `` Interlunar'': `` Do poets really suffer more `` than other people? Is n't it only `` that they get their pictures taken `` and are seen to do it? `` The loony bins are full of those `` who never wrote a poem. `` Most suicides are not `` poets: a good statistic.''

 <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> was born in 1939 in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. Although one of her aunts claims that she announced her intentions to become a writer at the age of five, <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> said she did not seriously begin writing until she was 16. She was 19 when her first poem was accepted for publication. Her first volume of poetry, `` Persephone,'' was published in 1961. In 1966, a collection of poems entitled `` The Circle Game'' won the Governor General's Award as the year's best book of poetry. `` The Circle Game'' sold 10,000 copies, a then unheard of total in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for works of poetry. `` In 1960, in <LOCATION> English </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, there were five novels published. You were doing very well to sell 1,000 novels,'' <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> said. `` When my first poems were published, they told me they had overprinted _ 450 copies instead of 400.'' She has written several novels besides `` The Handmaid's Tale,'' including `` Surfacing,'' `` Lady Oracle'' and `` Life Before Man.'' She has released two collections of short stories, two children's books and several works of criticism, notably 1972's `` Survival,'' an analysis of Canadian literature She is currently completing a new novel, `` Cat's Eye.'' <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, travels frequently and credits this with helping her writing. `` Traveling takes me out of my environment,'' she said. `` It gives me clear time. It's not the same as being in the office with the phone ringing all day. It also gives me context for my own country.'' Some parts of the world are more conducive for her writing than others. `` <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in the winter is a great place to write. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> on the beach is not.'' <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> became more politically involved in the 1970s. Her work displayed her interest in power _ how it works, how people use it, how people react to it. In the poem `` Marrying the Hangman,'' from her 1978 collection, `` Two-Headed Poems,'' she tells the story of a woman who is condemned to death by hanging for stealing her employer's clothes and can only escape her fate by marrying the hangman: `` She has been condemned to death by hanging. A man may escape this `` death by becoming the hangman, a woman by marrying the hangman. `` But at the present time there is no hangman; thus there is no escape. `` There is only a death, indefinitely postponed. This is not fantasy, it is history.'' The poem is about the choices people must make when confronting an unjust system. `` It depends on the circumstances. Sometimes you have no options; other times you have more,'' she said. `` A woman undergoing sexual harassment at work has more options than the woman who must marry the hangman. `` In the best of all possible worlds, you would n't have to make these choices, but it's not the best of all possible worlds.'' While <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> has been involved in a number of causes, her greatest concern is the environment. `` Forests are being cut down. If the forests are all gone, we will choke to death,'' she said. `` The ozone layer is being destroyed. This stuff is scary for everybody.'' <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> is critical of American writers who fail to integrate the political world into their work, although she cites <PERSON> E.L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doctorow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marge </PERSON> <PERSON> Piercy </PERSON> as notable exceptions. `` In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, writing is an individual thing,'' she said. `` It's the only country where people believe that. It's natural for American writers _ a habit of mind. However, she does see this changing. `` They live in a secure country. I predict, mark my words, as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> feels less secure, you'll see more integration in the writing,'' she said. `` A young person who wanted to become a writer asked me for suggestions on how to suffer,'' <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> said. `` Everybody suffers. You do n't have to find ways to suffer. Just live, you'll suffer.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Mickey Gilley Reflects On `Urban Cowboy'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Singer <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON>, whose earthy <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> nightclub was the focus of the movie `` Urban Cowboy,'' has n't set foot in the honky-tonk for two years. And he has n't regularly worn a cowboy hat for three years. Eight years after <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Travolta </PERSON> and co-star <ORGANIZATION> Debra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winger </ORGANIZATION> launched a fad known as `` cowboy chic,'' <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> has broken the ties that symbolized him as the country music singer most associated with the craze. The 52-year-old performer is in litigation over the nightclub in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where most of the 1980 movie was filmed. He claims an associate has let the cavernous club get run down. `` I drive by the club all the time, but I've not been in it for two years,'' <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` The business has practically died. The parking lot used to be full; now you can count the cars. I think it's just a matter of time until it goes under.'' And his cowboy hat, part of the Western attire that became fashionable because of the popularity of the movie, has seen its last roundup. `` I've got hair; there's nothing to cover up,'' <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> said. `` I do n't feel like a cowboy hat is something that's going to make or break my career. People had fun with that era and I did too. People wonder where's my hat, but I have n't worn one now for three years. People just have n't seen me as much.'' As one of the country music stars who sang in the movie, <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> shot to the top in show business on the tails of `` cowboy chic.'' He appeared in `` The Dukes of Hazzard,'' `` The Fall Guy,'' `` Hollywood Squares'' and `` Fantasy Island.'' His concert fee rose from $ 5,000 to $ 25,000. One night he was paid $ 50,000 for 90 minutes to perform at <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>'s nightclub in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a club that has since closed as the fad tailed off. <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> had six straight No. 1 country hits in the early 1980s when the movement peaked. His hits included `` Stand by Me,'' `` True Love Ways'' and `` Do n't the Girls All Get Prettier at Closing Time.'' Now, the era is a memory just like the mechanical bulls featured in the movie. `` Everything has its day,'' he said, reflecting on the `` cowboy chic'' heyday. `` Nothing lasts forever. People do n't realize that the ` urban cowboy' fad had gone on in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for years and years. `` People had fun with it. When ` Urban Cowboy' hit, it affected the whole world. <PERSON> Travolta </PERSON> brought everything to front and center. It was like a billboard going up. `` Had it not been for him playing that part, it would not have had the impact. He had done ` Saturday Night Fever,' and this was ` country night fever.' It was a different lifestyle, and it worked. `` Everyone became a cowboy or cowgirl. It was like when the Beatles came over and everyone grew their hair long and shook their heads. Everyone wanted to be part of what was happening. I'll remember it forever. In the movie, <PERSON> Travolta </PERSON> learned how to ride a mechanical bull at the nightclub in order to win the favor of Winger, who was then a relatively unknown actress. Today, <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> is not sure the devices were such a good idea. They were contraptions, ridden as one would a bull, whose gyrating was controlled by an operator. `` It was a rodeo training device and should never have been put in an entertainment establishment in the first place,'' <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> said. `` We still have suits pending over it.'' Nevertheless, nightclubs such as <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON>'s sprang up across the country, many of them with mechanical bulls. Some were converted discos and were patronized by customers in snappy cowboy hats, shiny cowboy boots and stylish Western wear. `` I probably remember the impact on country attire the most,'' <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> said. `` It was the first time you could walk into a casino in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> or Reno or <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and see guys in cowboy hats. It changedthe mood. It had its flash in the pan.'' <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON>, whose cousins are rock' n' roll star <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, has had 17 No. 1 records in a 14-year career. He's on the road 115 days a year, down sharply from his peak era. `` I got to the point I would n't do golf tourneys,'' he recalled. `` Back then, it was money, money, money; I was playing every place they threw in front of me. `` I wish I had cut in half what I did. I wanted to make as much money as quickly as I could. It was like a dragon: You feed it to keep it. The fire was coming out of his mouth,'' he said. `` I'm happier with my performing now because I'm working less and ending up with more money than during ` Urban Cowboy' because I'm able to do it with less people. `` Back then, I had a lifestyle of airplanes and buses and trucks. I did stupid things. I prostituted myself for the money.''

<TEXT>
 For a glimpse of elementary science the way it should be taught, but seldom is, turn right after the sea lions at the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> Zoo. There, in makeshift classrooms ripe with the sounds and smells of ferrets, falcons, porcupines and snakes, 30,000 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> elementary schoolchildren a year get a few hours to experience science the way scientists do: by touching, observing and experimenting. Instead of reading about it in some lifeless textbook, second graders from P.S. 205 actually saw a ferret demonstrate its natural defense: spinal flexibility that enables it to turn its long, slender body completely around in a narrow plastic tube and face potential danger. `` First we learned how the animals moved. Then we learned about their colors,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckles </PERSON>, a first-grader at P.S. 205. `` We saw a owl and a fire-bellied toad and we even touched a boa constrictor.'' Visitors from P.S. 29, another elementary school in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, felt the slimy back of a bullfrog for the first time in their lives _ after some coaxing from zoo instructor <PERSON> Nikki </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulak </PERSON> _ and learned about natural camouflage by studying the black and orange hide of a salamander. The classes, conducted by the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION>, are among 13 local science education programs cited as exemplary in a new <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> publication, `` Science Education Programs That Work.'' For about $ 300 to $ 400 per class, the program offers science training and materials for teachers, and three to six class visits to the zoo for students in grades Kindergarten through 6. But the program is a rare bright spot in an otherwise dismal landscape of elementary school science around the country.

Experts cite several problems: elementary teacher training that often bypasses or plays down science, school systems that stress reading and math scores and consider science a frill by comparison, failure by schools to make use of resources like planetariums and zoos, and overreliance on textbooks that rarely offer genuine experimentation or grounding in scientific method. The sorry state of elementary science instruction is the often overlooked reason that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students do so poorly in science later on in school compared with students in other industrialized countries. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> elementary and high school students, especially girls, know less about science than their counterparts did in 1970, according to a study released this year by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement of how students in 24 nations perform in science. For example, more than eight out of 10 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 5th graders in 1970 correctly answered a multiple choice question on how long it takes to travel to the moon. In 1986, only 47 percent of the 5th graders chose the correct answer: `` A few days.'' In an otherwise laudatory report on elementary education in 1986, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> singled out science instruction as a weak spot. The report, `` First Lessons,'' said the average fourth grader is lucky to get 30 minutes a day of science instruction. And rarely does it include a taste of genuine lab work or experimentation. `` We need a revolution in elementary school science,'' said the <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> report. `` There is probably no other subject whose teaching is so at odds with its true nature. `` We have come to think of science as a grab-bag of esoteric facts and stunts _ the periodic table, the innards of frogs, the way to make little hot plates out of tin cans and wires.'' Across the street from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION>, at P.S. 205, teachers and administrators have struggled to include more science in the curriculum, especially `` hands-on'' lessons featuring experimentation and visual demonstrations. The elementary school's teachers, bored with the standard science curriculum handed down by the central school board, got together about three years ago and devised their own enriched curriculum which pooled their knowledge and downplayed the role of standard textbooks. `` I remember that we were scared about science as teachers. We were not science mavens,'' said <PERSON> Rosanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Turits </PERSON>, head early childhood teacher at P.S. 205. But the school has no lab, and science coordinator <PERSON> Maryanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON> must make do with a budget of just $ 250 for equipment like thermometers and magnifying glasses. As a result, `` hands-on'' science sometimes means a few minutes at the end of a lesson looking at light through a prism. Or the old perennial: growing lima bean plants. According to a little-publicized report funded by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> last November: _ the nation's Kindergarten-through-third graders spend an average of 19 minutes per day on science, increasing to 38 minutes in grades 4-6; _ 69 percent of Kindergarten-through-third grade teachers rely on textbooks, rising to 89 percent by grades _ three-quarters of Kindergarten-through-third grade classes get science lectures, 87 percent have discussions, but only half use hands-on materials or participate in lab work Yet two-thirds of science teachers `` agree'' or `` strongly agree'' that lab classes are more effective. _ while 87 percent of elementary teachers took `` methods'' courses in teaching elementary science, only three out of 10 took college level chemistry, 17 percent took physics, 58 percent took biology And in a recent critique of nine commonly used elementary science texts, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagel </PERSON>, co-directors of <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, private textbook consultants in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, concluded that science programs relying on such texts `` teach students to think of science mainly as a collection of conclusions to be memorized.'' Such texts, the critique said, hardly mention, much less explain, `` the fundamental canons and methods of scientific inquiry, the attitude of objectivity, or the sometimes tedious pursuit of all leads _ inevitably including dead ends _ in scientific investigations.'' Real experimentation lays open many possible alternatives and answers. But typically, such texts offer recipes in place of genuine lab activity. They lay out the goal, state the materials needed, give instructions, and then provide the `` correct answer,'' _ what's supposed to happen `` School science,'' the <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nagel </PERSON> concluded, `` is too often simply the pursuit of the known.''

Hay is n't out to replace coaches with his statistics and stick figures. `` We're only seeing one side of this from the films and analysis,'' he said. `` The coach sees this every day from many different angles.'' He also wo n't take credit for improving any individual's performance `` If we work with an athlete and he or she improves dramatically later that year, it may be because of what we said or it may be in spite of what we said. There's no way of telling. `` The only indication is what the athletes and coaches tell us. What they tell us in general is that it's very, very helpful. `` They keep coming back.''

<HEAD>Electrical Disturbances In Heart Blamed For Cocaine-Induced Deaths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Seemingly healthy cocaine users who drop dead may be victims of the drug's interference with the heart's electrical activity Researchers <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Avakian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracken </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> injected rats and rabbits dosages equivalent to a 160-pound chronic abuser who smokes or injects 1.5 grams or `` snorts'' 3 grams of cocaine a day. Their studies suggest that cocaine causes sudden cardiac death by triggering abnormal heart rhythms, said <PERSON> Avakian </PERSON>, a physiologist-pharmacologist. Many cocaine-induced arrhythmias are temporary but others, called ventricular arrhythmias, kill because they halt the heart's ability to pump. The findings also suggest that while long-term daily cocaine users develop tolerance to the drug's effects on the heart, they are particularly susceptible to sudden death if they stop taking it and then resume. `` Cocaine is not always available, so one might not take it for one or two days,'' <PERSON> Avakian </PERSON> said. `` A brief withdrawal of one or two days can put a user at much more risk, especially during a stress situation like exercise.'' The risk of death from injecting cocaine or smoking its `` free-base'' or `` crack'' forms is particularly high because much more is absorbed into blood, where it can directly affect the heart, he said. <PERSON> Avakian </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bracken </PERSON>, a physiologist, and colleagues set out to explain such deaths as those in 1986 of <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> basketball star <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Bias </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION> football player <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>. As of early 1987, there had been eight such deaths among 49 documented cases of cocaine-induced heart trouble, according to research by Dr. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Isner </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Avakian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bracken </PERSON>, who outlined their work at a <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Experimental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biology </ORGANIZATION> meeting last month, used 40 rabbits and 300 rats. Some received no cocaine; others got daily doses for eight weeks. Some of the animals were killed 30 minutes after the last injection. Others were killed two days later to simulate withdrawal from cocaine. The hearts were removed and kept pumping in laboratory containers filled with a blood substitute while researchers monitored heart electrical activity, blood flow through coronary arteries, and heart rate, rhythm and contractions. Then the researchers added cocaine alone or cocaine and adrenalin to the blood substitute bathing the hearts. Adrenalin normally is produced by the body during exercise or other physical or emotional stress. Hearts from animals that got cocaine before they were killed showed more disruption of electrical impulse transmission, probably because cocaine acts as a local anesthetic, <PERSON> Avakian </PERSON> said. The studies also showed chronic cocaine use, when combined with adrenalin, constricts coronary arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart. The combination of cocaine-induced arrythmias and the decreased blood flow increases the odds of sudden death, he said. Hearts from animals withdrawn from cocaine for two days were supersensitive to adrenalin and cocaine, suggesting sudden death is more likely in chronic abusers who stop and start again, particularly if they exercise or are otherwise stressed.

 For a glimpse of elementary science the way it should be taught, but seldom is, turn right after the sea lions at the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> Zoo.

<HEAD>Many Smokers Sabotage Benefit of Ultra-Low-Tar Cigarettes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If your ultra-low-tar cigarette tastes better than you expect, you may not be smoking it right _ and may be getting higher doses of tar _ say researchers who studied discarded cigarette butts. Fifty-eight percent of 135 cigarette filters found in ash trays at a shopping mall showed evidence that smokers had at least partially blocked the cigarette's air vents with their lips or fingers, the researchers report. Ultra-low-tar cigarettes depend on those vents to dilute cigarette smoke and reduce the yield of tar. Blocking them raises the tar a smoker consumes, the researchers wrote in June's <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. `` Smokers block vents to enhance smoking satisfaction. Some do not realize that better taste means increased tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide, thinking that there are special low-tar tobaccos in the cigarette; other smokers are unaware of blocking the vents,'' they wrote, citing previous research. `` Smokers of low-tar cigarettes ... need to be told that, if they do not miss their high-yield cigarette smoke, it may not really have gone away,'' wrote <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozlowski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lux </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Addiction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>40 Percent of Women In Study Said No to Sex But Meant Yes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly 40 percent of college coeds in a study report they had said `` no'' to sex when they meant `` yes,'' but researchers say that since most of the women meant what they said, men should n't ignore such refusals. About a third of the women said they had offered this token resistance only once, and 46 percent had used it only two to five times. But since most women reported never offering such resistance, the result `` does not mean that men can safely ignore women's refusals When a woman says no, chances are that she means it ... -LRB- and -RRB- regardless of the incidence of token resistance, if the woman means no and the man persists, it is rape,'' wrote <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researchers <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Muehlenhard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollabaugh </PERSON>. They gave an anonymous questionnaire to 610 female students, average age 19, at their school. Results appear in the May issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Twenty-three percent of the 240 coeds who offred token resistance said manipulative reasons, such as game-playing, anger with the man or desire to be in control, were at least moderately important reasons for resisting. About an equal percentage cited such reasons as fear of appearing promiscuous, fear of catching disease, or uncertainty about their partner's feelings.

<HEAD>Anti-parasite Drug Being Tested In Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Suramin, a drug long used to treat parasite infections, is being tested for the first time as a way to attack cancer. Doctors from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> used it on 10 people with advanced, spreading cases of cancer of the adrenal gland. Although it did not cure their disease, suramin seemed to slow the cancer by blocking body chemicals known as growth factors. Tumors need these substances to promote their own growth. `` We believe that suramin is the first of a class of growth factor-inhibiting drugs,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Cy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>. `` Even if it is not the ideal drug, it is helping us to learn what scheme is necessary to stop tumors from growing by inhibiting their growth factors.'' In two of the patients, tumors were reduced by more than 50 percent, while those in two others decreased by 25 to 50 percent. The disease remained stable in three while progressing in three. <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said that once the drug was stopped, the cancer recurred rapidly. Doctors are now considering trying suramin on other forms of cancer and combining it with standard chemotherapy drugs. The most serious side effect was nerve damage, which doctors said may limit how long people can stay on suramin. The results were reported at a recent meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oncology </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Drug-Coated Beads Slow Liver Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tiny beads coated with cancer-killing drugs are being tested to slow progression of liver cancer, a uniformly fatal disease. The treatment, called chemoembolization, uses beads of starch that have been treated with chemotherapy medicines to temporarily dam up the hepatic artery, the major artery that supplies the liver. This deprives the tumor of blood while putting it in contact with drugs. Doctors say the combination can stop the growth of the tumor and sometimes shrink it. In a few days, the starch is absorbed into the body, and blood flow resumes. During the temporary blockade, the liver continues to receive blood through the portal vein. Among 30 patients who received the experimental treatment at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, two had dramatic responses. One had no recurrence of the tumor for 16 months and the other for over two years. In about three-quarters, the tumor shrank significantly or temporarily stopped growing. Dr. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Venook </PERSON>, who outlined the results at a recent <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oncology </ORGANIZATION> meeting, said the new treatment provides temporary relief from the spread of the disease but is not a cure. `` It is better than anything else around,'' he said. `` Some patients have shown remarkable improvement, but the therapy needs further development.''

 At <ORGANIZATION> Hyatt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, executives are basking in government praise of their model compliance with the new immigration law, which makes it illegal to knowingly hire undocumented aliens. But on the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border, a Mexican fast-food chain fears possible raids by the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. And in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a waterbed-frame factory is challenging what it calls abusive and arbitrary <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> inspection tactics, in the first significant court test of the new law's sweeping employer-sanction provisions As the Wednesday deadline looms for enforcement of those sanctions, employers and immigration lawyers are giving the law and the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> a mixed review. Many say the agency has shown extraordinary tolerance and the new documentation requirements for employees are only a minor nuisance. Others contend immigration officers have failed to educate a large number of businesses and the paperwork is horrendously confusing. `` My sense is that many employers are n't complying with the law,'' said <PERSON> Ilene </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lainer </PERSON>, immigration specialist at the law firm of <LOCATION> Grotta </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Glassman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Roseland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` A lot of companies fell through the cracks.'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bompey </PERSON>, immigration lawyer at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm of <ORGANIZATION> Baer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Upham </LOCATION>, said large employers are complying because they are more sophisticated than smaller businesses and have the resources to efficiently keep records. `` The little guy who runs the small garment shop or something like that, probably is n't in compliance and wo n't be in compliance,'' he said. `` It's the same as non-compliance with overtime laws, until somebody knocks on his door.'' Some predict the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> will stage zealous enforcement raids after the Wednesday expiration of the 11-month phase-in period, during which it only issued warnings to first offenders and stressed voluntary compliance. `` My impression is there will be a lot happening after June 1,'' said <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Klasko </PERSON>, president-elect of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and co-author of an employers guide to compliance with the new law. The November 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act requires the nation's 8 million employers to document the legal status of employees hired after the law was signed, with a new form called the I-9. Employers must fire those who can not prove work eligibility. Employer penalties range from $ 250 to $ 2,000 per worker for first offenses, to $ 10,000 per worker and 6 months in jail for repeated violations. Failure to do the paperwork can result in fines ranging from $ 100 to $ 1,000 per violation. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said visits to employers nationwide suggest that about 90 percent are in compliance or nearly so. `` We're encouraged by that, because we know the only way this law is going to work will be to have compliance,'' <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said. `` We do n't have the resources to visit 8 million employers.'' He declined to characterize the post-Wednesday policing effort as a crackdown, but said that `` I think you're going to see more enforcement.'' Despite earlier grumblings about an additional bureaucratic nuisance, some large employers are now praising the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> for explaining how the law works. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, in turn, has sought to establish good relationships with many businesses and publicly compliments model followers of the new law. For example at Hyatt, which like other big hotel chains historically has attracted undocumented aliens for low-pay positions, there was some initial fear about its ability to employ qualified workers. But the company asked for <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> assistance to comply and received an award from the agency. Some smaller businesses also have found it relatively easy to comply after initial complaints. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenzweig </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Linden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maintenance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a taxi company in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, predicted last year that the new law would be a `` nightmare'' because of his constantly changing work force. But he changed his mind. `` It has n't developed into a major problem anymore,'' he said. `` It's become more of a routine, not a burden as I see it.'' But fear toward the new law and the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> prevail along the southern <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border, where most illegals enter the country. At <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pato </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, manager <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> worries about surprise inspections at the fast food chain. `` We've been trying our darndest to comply with the law,'' he said. `` But what if they come in unannounced while a recently hired person is working for us and we still do n't have the proper documentation in our office? If they're going to pounce on us, then we're in trouble.'' INS tactics have been the focus of a court case in which Mester Manufacturing, a 70-worker waterbed-frame maker in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, challenged the agency's determination that it knowingly and repeatedly hired illegals. Arguments before an administrative law judge revealed that <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officers who searched the factory might have abused their authority and ignored earlier company requests for help in complying with the law. `` The judge was pretty disgusted with a lot of this stuff,'' said attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Larrabee </PERSON>. `` They're trying to stick it to employers. It takes an employer like my client that gets incensed to fight big brother.'' Under a special provision for farmers who employ migrant laborers, full enforcement will not begin until late this year. But there is widespread fear among many growers that the law will make it hard to find harvesting help. In eastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, for example, strawberry farmers have planted only one third the usual acreage this year, fearing they can no longer rely on the large numbers of illegal Mexican migrants who have come every season. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Malensky </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` Everyone's concerned that if we plant'em, who's going to pick'em?''

<TEXT>
 The government today urged leading corporations to boost imports of manufactured goods in an effort to reduce <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s massive trade surplus In a meeting with representatives of 151 firms, Minister of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON> requested the companies `` make further efforts to expand the increase of foreign imports,'' said <PERSON> Atsushi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawashima </PERSON>, director of the import division of <ORGANIZATION> MITI </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trading partners have called on the country to curtail exports and promote imports in an effort to slash its heavy global trade surplus. <PERSON> Kawashima </PERSON> said imports of manufactured goods rose from $ 55.2 billion in fiscal 1986 to $ 73.9 billion in fiscal 1987, fueled mainly by the rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen. Since September 1985, the yen has risen by more than 100 percent against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. The higher value of the yen has made Japanese products more expensive overseas, but has tended to increase the import purchasing power of Japanese. The companies should `` take advantage of the ... yen's appreciation to the greatest extent,'' <PERSON> Kawashima </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON> as telling the firms' representatives during the one-hour meeting at the ministry According to <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> figures, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus last fiscal year totaled $ 76.01 billion, down from $ 89.74 billion in fiscal 1986. The decrease was the first in six years. <PERSON> Kawashima </PERSON> said the government hopes to reduce the trade surplus by another $ 11 billion this fiscal year, which ends next March 31. He said the call for more imports also was made by ministry officials to 151 other firms for a total of 302 companies which represent the core of the Japanese economy. The corporations, including big trading houses such as <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Itoh </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, were responsible for 60 percent of the total fiscal 1987 import figure, he said. The companies as a group increased their imports last year by 38 percent and hope to increase them by a further 17 percent in fiscal 1988, he said. <PERSON> Kawashima </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON> also requested the companies to report at the end of the first half of fiscal 1988 on the results of their import expansion programs.

<HEAD>New, Single-Family Home Sales Up 4 Percent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sales of new, single-family homes rose 4 percent in April to the highest level in a year, the government said today. In a joint release, the departments of Commerce and of Housing and <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said new single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of of 679,000 last month, up from the March pace of 653,000. It was the third consecutive monthly increase and the highest level since new homes were sold at a rate of 728,000 in April 1987. Despite the recent increases, sales for the first four months of this year are still 9 percent below the same period of 1987, when mortgage interest rates hit nine-year lows. The April climb came atop a modest 1.2 percent rise in March and a whopping 11.4 percent rise in February. However, the increases followed three consecutive declines _ in November, December and January _ which analysts at the time said were caused by the October stock market crash. Some economists had feared that the downturn in housing sales signaled a recession, but since then the economy has proved to be robust and the housing sector has more than recovered. Most analysts, though, believe that sales levels of the last few months will drop by the fall as rising mortgage interest rates push up the monthly cost of owning a home and discourage buyers. Rates on 30-year, fixed-rate conventional mortgages averaged 10.58 percent last week, more than half a percentage point higher than levels in February and March. The increase in sales of new homes was accompanied by a rise in prices. The median, or mid-point, price of new homes was $ 110,500 in April, up 3.3 percent from March. The average price of a new home rose 4.2 percent in April. However, the increases came after two consecutive monthly price declines, which analysts had said reflected the re-entry into the market of first-time home buyers, who normally purchase less expensive homes. Sales increased in all regions of the country in April. They were up 5.9 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, 5.5 percent in the West, 2.9 percent in the South and 2.8 percent in the Northeast. In a separate report last week, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said sales of existing homes increased 4.5 percent in April after identical increases of 2.5 percent in March and February.

Soybean prices came down slightly from their opening highs as traders took profits. But with meteorologists predicting little precipitation in the Corn Belt until later this week, prices were expected to continue at four-year highs. As soybean planting approaching completion, fears are intensifying that a dry summer could lead to tight supplies next year, analysts said. Most soybean contracts were trading this morning above $ 8 a bushel, a price not seen since the spring of 1984. In early trading, wheat was 11 cents to 13 cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.50 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 8 cents to 9 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 2.24 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 6 \ cents to 6 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 1.79 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 7 cents to 30 cents higher with July at $ 7.97 cents a bushel Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were substantially higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .13 cent to .65 cent higher with June at 72.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .22 cent lower with August at 76 cents a pound; hogs were .30 cent to .95 cent higher with June at 54.35 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .70 cent to 1.38 cent higher with July at 55.70 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Keeping the House Instead of Moving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 During the 1960s it was common for young couples to buy a relatively low-priced `` first house,'' which was a subtle way of letting you know they really aspired to much better things. A few years later, having acquired some equity, they moved to a more commodious dwelling in what they considered a better neighborhood, one they felt was more in keeping with their view of themselves. While the motive was snobbish, the results often were quite practical. The better house in a better neighborhood might rise sharply in value, as many of them did during the inflated 1970s. Smart move. Now something quite different is taking place. Rather than moving, many young couples are staying put, fixing up the old house to suit their needs, and in the process saving themselves a lot of headaches and dollars. Look around the old neighborhood and you'll see the evidence: new rooms, decks, energy-efficient doors and windows, swimming pools. In some instances small houses are almost encased by additions twice the size. And once again, the reasons for so doing make sense. Two big factors are at work: 1. Many families prefer to stay put for financial and social-cultural reasons. By remaining, they save various closing costs, taxes, legal fees, moving expenses and the like. They are able to retain ties to churches, schools and other organizations. And the home might be more convenient to work. 2. A percentage of families that once might have sought new homes in new developments, as in the 1960s, might be more inclined now to move into homes in existing neighborhoods, fixing up to meet their specific needs. Influencing such behavior might be the surge in new-home prices, contrasted with bargain prices that sometimes can be found for fix-up houses in older but still desirable neighborhoods. Whatever the reasons, expenditures for residential remodeling in the past three years have exceeded $ 270 billion, and about $ 200 billion is expected to be added to that total by the end of 1989. Last year, according to a preliminary estimate by the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, $ 94.1 billion was spent on alterations and repairs. While this was only 3.1 percent higher than in 1986, it was triple the amount spent 10 years earlier. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Azola </PERSON>, chairman of the of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>' remodeling council, believes the pace will quicken to $ 98 billion this year and to more than $ 100 billion in 1989. Of 77 million people born during the post-World War II baby boom, about half own their homes, <PERSON> Azola </PERSON> says. He observes that while many have been trading up, `` others are staying put and upgrading.'' The upgrading trend does n't seem to be a reflection of a tougher housing market, as some market analysts contend. It appears not to be solely, if at all, a consequence of couples being unable to make any other choice. In fact, the remodeling splurge might even be related to the strong sales that have persisted during the past five years. Azola, for example, cites a study by the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> which found that half of all remodeling expenditures are by people who have moved during the previous five years. `` When people move into an existing home, they often want to make alterations,'' <PERSON> Azola </PERSON> says, adding: `` So when an existing home is sold, there is a good chance that a remodeling job will occur in the near future.''

 Computer assembly might seem unlikely in the middle of the nation's largest national forest, but the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Angoon </LOCATION> has programmed its future in microchips. The village Native corporation, <ORGANIZATION> Kootznoowoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, rented an empty building in town, trained a dozen new employees and went to work this spring building IBM-compatible computers from imported components. Almost 50 units have been produced at the plant, which has totem poles in front and high-tech electronic gear inside. Federal agencies and corporations have been the main customers, but a retail shop two blocks from the state Capitol also offers the computers to the public. `` The Kootznoowoo board of directors has had a policy of trying to promote economic development in <LOCATION> Angoon </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawk </PERSON>, controller of the corporation's computer subsidiary. `` Electronics immediately came to the top of the list.'' `` The electronics industry is an industry you can add a lot of value to and not pay a lot of freight,'' <PERSON> Hawk </PERSON> said. Electronic parts do n't weigh much and that holds down freight costs for the company's operation on an island more than 800 miles north of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Environmental concerns also played a part in the decision. `` Anything having to do with electronics is a clean industry,'' <PERSON> Hawk </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Angoon </PERSON>, a village of about 600 people on <LOCATION> Admiralty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, is 60 miles south of the state capital at <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. Freight from the Lower 48 must come first to <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> and then move by barge, boat or plane to <PERSON> Angoon </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Kootznoowoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was established under the 1971 <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Native Claims Settlement Act, which distributed money and land to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Natives to settle claims against the federal government. The act established 13 regional and about 200 village corporations to manage the property. <PERSON> Kootznoowoo </PERSON>'s nearly 700 shareholders are Tlingit Indians, two-thirds of whom still live on Admiralty, an island almost 80 times the size of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. The corporation's assets totaled $ 33 million as of the end of the past fiscal year. <PERSON> Kootznoowoo </PERSON> is the Tlingit word for Admiralty. It translates to `` Fortress of the Bears,'' in reference to the island's large population of brown bear. <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Native </ORGANIZATION> corporations have gone into construction, mining, timber, seafood, real estate and oil exploration services, but this is the first venture into computers, <PERSON> Hawk </PERSON> said. As far as he has been able to determine from federal officials, <PERSON> Kootznoowoo </PERSON> is the first Indian corporation in the country to assemble computers. The Bureau of Indian Affairs has purchased several of the computers, and an order is expected soon from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Timber is the company's only other business, <PERSON> Hawk </PERSON> said, although the board is looking at entering the tourism and seafood processing industries. The corporation a year ago established <ORGANIZATION> Kootznoowoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as a subsidiary to develop new businesses and jobs for its shareholders. As its first venture, KGS this winter leased an empty 1,800-square-foot building from the city for use as a computer assembly plant. The building was put up six years ago for use as a museum, but the city never had money to operate it and it sat empty for five years. `` If we had to factor in the cost of building a plant, we probably never would have considered the idea,'' <PERSON> Hawk </PERSON> said. The building was constructed with humidity, temperature and dust controls to protect artifacts _ making it perfect for electronics work. KGS President <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said 30 people applied when the company advertised in the village for computer assembly jobs. A dozen people were hired and trained, the building remodeled, and the first 12 computers were built, all for a start-up cost of a little over $ 20,000, <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Kootznoowoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> provided $ 50,000 as an initial line of credit for its subsidiary, <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said. Additional money was contributed later. `` Memory chips are getting very expensive,'' <PERSON> Hawk </PERSON> said. A worldwide microchip shortage has driven up prices, and although <PERSON> Kootznoowoo </PERSON> is physically isolated from <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, it faces the same market pressures as the rest of the industry. The company offers two models, marketed under the names KGS Wolf-AT and Wolf-386. The computers are named in honor of the late corporation president, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, who died last year in a traffic accident. He was a member of the <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> clan and his Indian name meant `` <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> who cries in the wilderness.'' Although KGS employees assemble the computers, the monitors and keyboards are purchased intact. <PERSON> Hawk </PERSON> said the company could assemble those items, too, if it had enough sales volume to justify the expansion. The KGS building has room for 20 work stations. `` It is designed so that one person does all the assembly of the machine,'' <PERSON> Hawk </PERSON> said, rather than operating as an assembly line. If expectations of federal contracts, corporate purchases and increased retail sales come true, the company hopes for sales of 100 units a month by the end of the year. `` Our main focus has been government offices in the Lower 48,'' he said. Production of 100 units a month would result in annual revenues exceeding $ 2 million _ not even a nick out of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s blue chip stock, but big business for a village of 600 people.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today that the bulk of so-called `` gray market'' goods are legal, giving a green light to a big part of a multi-billion-dollar business that allows consumers to buy costly, brand-name imports at steep discounts. In another case, the court ruled that states sometimes may execute convicted murderers even if theirright to a lawyer's help was violated. In constitutional splintered voting, the justices upheld parts of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> regulations that permit gray market products into the country without approval from trademark owners. The court also struck down part of the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> rules, thereby limiting somewhat the availability of the discount goods. But some justices said those rules only apply to a small part of the dispute decided today. The exact size of the gray market is unclear. Estimates have ranged from $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion a year. The declining value of the dollar, reducing its purchasing power abroad, may have dampened the market. But the business still appears to be thriving. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, writing for the court, said a keyersity of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s College of Veterinary Medicine. <PERSON> Nettles </PERSON> helped write the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report and is formulating regulations to use as a model for state governments. `` There are disease implications. There are human safety implications, which make the headlines read big _ a kid gets eaten by a polar bear in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. And there's the escape factor, which from a naturalist point of view is very important.'' But the debate between exotic animal dealers and animal rights activists rages most fiercely over the moral issue. Is is right or wrong to put wild animals in a cage? And does captivity ensure a species' survival or hasten its death? `` I believe animals are here for our use, but not our abuse,'' says <PERSON> Hoctor </PERSON>. `` There's nothing wrong with owning a pair of ostrich boots if we're culling ostrich males. However, if in our smug admiration of ourselves we rape nature and make those animals endangered so we can have a pair of ostrich boots, that's wrong.'' Others believe there is no reason to exploit a wild animal when there are plenty of domestic animals that already provide companionship, food and warmth. `` That type of thinking _ justifying the exploitation of animals by juding them as an economic resource _ is going to lead to more and more species becoming endangered,'' says <PERSON> Herbet </PERSON>. `` Animals have an intrinsic value and ecological value. You should n't have to put a dollar value on it to ensure its survival.''

 Soybean futures prices soared the 30-cents-a-bushel limit allowed for daily trading Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in response to the Midwest's hot, dry weekend and predictions for more of the same.

The spring planting season has been unusually dry. Wheat, corn and oat crops also would suffer during a summer of little rain, but the rapid depletion of soybean stockpiles has made that market particularly sensitive to growing conditions. Tuesday's gains brought the near-month soybean contract, for delivery in July, to within easy striking range of $ 8 a bushel for the first time since the spring of 1984. Eight of the nine soybean contracts were up the limit, as was the contract for March 1989 delivery of corn, which carries a 10-cents-a-bushel limit. Some oat futures traded up their 10-cent limit during the session but closed below those highs. At the close, wheat was 9 -LCB- cents to 15 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.51 a bushel; corn was 7 -RCB- cents to 10 cents higher with July at $ 2.24 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 9 \ cents to 9 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 1.82 \ a bushel; soybeans were 18 cents to 30 cents higher with July at $ 7.98 a

<HEAD>New Construction Contracts Fall In April</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release after 6:30 p.m. EDT; time set by source</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Contracting for new construction projects declined 6 percent in April from the previous month, extending a downward slide that began last fall, a report released Tuesday said. The survey, by the F.W. Dodge Division of <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, estimated the annualized value of all newly started construction projects in April at $ 226.97 billion, compared with $ 242.38 billion in March. F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> said its seasonally adjusted index of construction contracting fell to 144 in April from 154 in March, a three-month low. The index is based on a level of 100 for 1982. The April drop was the latest in a series of industrywide setbacks that began early last fall, when building activity was 20 percent above its current level. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, vice president and chief economist for F.W. Dodge, said high vacancy rates in commercial properties, particularly offices and apartments, were responsible in reversing the industry's five-year upswing. He said the situation was not expected to improve in the near term. `` The export boom which is pumping up the 1988 economy is n't much help to the construction industry, and could even prove troublesome,'' <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said `` As economic activity heats up, rising interest rates imply still lower building later in the year.'' Contracting for residential buildings slid 7 percent in April to an annualized value of $ 109.4 billion, due largely to a decline in apartment construciton, according to the report. April contracts for non-residential building was off 5 percent to $ 76.8 billion from $ 80.86 billion. The value of non-building contracts, which include public works and utility projects, fell 6 percent to $ 40.81 billion from $ 43.59 billion, the report said.

 <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s schedules were disrupted again Tuesday as some flight attendants continued to refuse to work overtime in apparent protest of an impasse in contract negotiations. The airline, based in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, canceled 24 flights in its first eight hours of operation Tuesday, said spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON>. `` It's a very, very small percentage of the total,'' <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said. `` There's not chaos at the airports.'' <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> schedules about 1,600 flights daily, <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said.

An impasse in contract negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> apparently prompted the airline's flight attendants to decline overtime <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> has yet to complete an agreement for a new contract and seniority list with its flight attendants and those employed by <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> last year and merged into <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s system April 9. `` Apparently there is -LRB- a protest -RRB-, but it's not a union-organized protest.

I was as surprised as anyone else,'' said <PERSON> Juliette </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenoir </PERSON>, vice president of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based union and a <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> flight attendant. `` My best sense is that flight attendants are just very upset at this whole issue of pay parity for the former <ORGANIZATION> PSA </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants.

He said two classes of about 40 new flight attendants each were assigned to flights to help. <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said flight attendants' overtime is governed by federal regulations which limit them to 85 hours per month. He said flight attendants may fly five extra hours per month as overtime at the request of airlines, but they are not required to do so.

<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new pasteurizing process that gives liquid eggs a three-month shelf life may provide a cheap alternative to conventional eggs and the frozen variety, officials said Tuesday. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, called the process developed at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> a breakthrough in the handling of egg products. Under an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> N.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, patents for the ultra-pasteurization and aseptic packaging process are licensed to <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eggs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Richfield </LOCATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> N.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> received a $ 100,000 royalty check Tuesday and will get 2 percent of royalties from future sales. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, vice president for Morning Glory Eggs, said the new product should be available within 12 months. Liquid eggs would be far superior to frozen products currently on the market, because producing, shipping and storing liquid eggs is nine times more efficient than with frozen eggs, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. `` I do n't know whether the entire savings will translate into lower costs, but it should certainly provide a significant savings,'' he said. In order to extend a shelf life of seven to 10 days, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> State researchers developed a way to heat the eggs `` on the run'' through tubes, said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartzel </PERSON>, associate professor of food science. The heat kills disease-causing and spoilage bacteria without coagulating the egg. The egg mixture is then packaged in sterile containers ranging from small, easy-pour cartons to huge bags for commercial bakeries and fast-food restaurants. For restaurants now using eggs in the shell, `` switching from using shell eggs would provide an added layer of protection from possible contamination from shells or packaging materials,'' said <PERSON> Hershell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, professor of food science. For those using frozen eggs, the new product will be more convenient while consuming less energy. <PERSON> Swartzel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Foods </PERSON> is working with researchers to remove cholesterol from eggs either by changing the diets of hens or through a chemical process. `` When that technology becomes commercially available, we will be in a position to protect the integrity of that product all the way to the shelf,'' he said. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said the technology could help an industry hurt by health concerns over cholesterol's influence on heart disease. `` We're turning what most people in the egg industry regarded as a problem into an opportunity,'' said <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, president of the Georgia-based <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poultry </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Egg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, praised the process, saying, `` It will benefit the middleman and provide labor savings for the food service industry. ... It's as close to being sterile as any egg product that's available.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Foods </PERSON> is spending $ 4.3 million to expand a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> plant to accommodate the new process and may spend another $ 2 million to $ 4 million for similar work at a <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> plant, <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said.

 The stock market posted one of its strongest advances of the year today as traders went on a post-Memorial holiday buying spree. Analysts said there was no single piece of economic news to account for the surge, but said traders appeared to be betting that interest rates are approaching a peak for the time being. The pace of trading has been slow in recent weeks as traders have demonstrated little conviction about the implications of continuing strength in the economy. While a strong economy could bode well for corporate profits, some investors worried that an expanding economy could also reignite inflation. But analysts said the market was heartened that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> had failed to raise its discount rate _ the interest on its loans to financial institutions _ last week after the markets had closed. Some of the buying in today's session, they said, came from traders who had speculated that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would push interest rates yet higher and had sold borrowed stocks last week in anticipation that they could buy them back later at cheaper prices. Once stock prices began rising today, analysts said some of these traders bought stocks to cover those positions and other investors climbed aboard. The analysts said the market's performance was remarkable in view of a rise in commodity futures prices, which might normally stir inflation fears.

<HEAD>Dollar's Strength Builds, Gold Rises</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The dollar strengthened in foreign exchange trading Tuesday amid a rally on Wall Street and speculation by investors that interest rates were approaching a short-term peak. Gold prices also rose. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said gold bullion was bid at $ 454.30 a troy ounce at 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 451 late Friday. Traders in the currency markets, returning from a long weekend, said the dollar was drawing its strength from firm interest rates in the credit markets. Although rumors of an imminent move to tighten credit by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> did not materialize, traders remained encouraged by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rate environment. The federal funds rate, representing the charge for overnight loans between banks, traded at 7 | percent, up from 7 \ late `` The general sense of the market is that while interest rates are firm, the dollar will put in a better performance,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGroarty </PERSON>, a vice president with <ORGANIZATION> Discount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar proved resilient enough to withstand an early move by the West German central bank to sell dollars to keep it in line with other currencies, traders noted. The <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 7.4 million as the dollar moved above the psychologically important level of 1.72 West German marks. Some investors had been counting on the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to push interest rates higher at the end of last week by raising its discount loan rate to member banks. When that did n't happen after the close of the financial markets Friday, some traders became convinced interest rates might be peaking. The result was a post-Memorial Day rally in stock prices and the dollar. The moves were unusual, traders said, because they came against a backdrop of rising commodity prices, including gold, and a drop in the yield of long-term government bonds. The dollar closed in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> at 124.80 Japanese yen, down from Monday's 124.98 yen. In later <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading it rose to 125.50 yen, and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 125.235 yen, up from 124.925 late Friday. The dollar also gained against the British pound in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where it was quoted late Tuesday at $ 1.8385, compared with $ 1.8478 in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Monday and $ 1.8570 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Friday. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> financial markets also were closed Monday for a national holiday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound fetched $ 1.8353 Tuesday, compared with $ 1.85735 late Friday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday, included: 1.73265 West German marks, up from 1.7178; 1.44525 Swiss francs, up from 1.4358; 5.8300 French francs, up from 5.7770; 1,284.00 Italian lire, up from 1,273.13; and 1.2333 Canadian dollars, down from 1.23915. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.7292 West German marks, up from 1.7270; 1.4437 Swiss francs, up from 1.4415; 5.8215 French francs, up from 5.8025; 1.9333 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9335; 1,279.95 Italian lire, down from 1,280.00; and 1.2357 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2378. Gold prices around the world got a boost from big gains in the platinum market. The late bid price in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was $ 454.80 a troy ounce, up from late Friday's $ 452. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid $ 455, up from late Monday's $ 452.50.

<HEAD>Broad Surge In Futures Prices May Signal Change In Markets:
Analysts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Commodity prices surged broadly Tuesday, propelling a key inflation indicator to a three-year high and suggesting the nation's financial markets have reached a crossroads, analysts said. Advances in prices for future delivery of soybeans, corn, oats, hogs, pork bellies and platinum spurred the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s index of 21 commodities to a 5.50-point gain. The index settled at 248.39, its highest mark since February 1985, said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinbein </PERSON>, senior technical analyst for the private, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-based </LOCATION> advisory service for commodities traders. Futures on wheat, hogs, cattle, oil, gold, silver, stocks and bonds also moved higher. A concurrent rise in stock-index and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond futures is unusual. Such occurrences historically mark turning points in the financial markets, <PERSON> Shinbein </PERSON> said. `` My feeling is that stocks are coming out of an oversold condition and commodities are moving into an overbought condition,'' he said. Such a scenario would call eventually for a sharp drop in commodities prices. Analysts could cite no single reason behind Tuesday's sharp gains but the the buying surges appeared to hit the markets in domino fashion, beginning with grains and soybeans. Soybean futures opened and closed up the 30-cents-a-bushel limit allowed for daily trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in response to the Midwest's hot, dry weekend and predictions for more of the same. `` Weather's the story, that's the whole ball game,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported soybean planting was about 74 percent finished as of Sunday. Traders fear a drier-than-normal summer could lead to tight supplies next year, analysts said. Wheat, corn and oat crops also would suffer during a summer of little rain, but the rapid depletion of soybean stockpiles has made that market particularly sensitive to growing conditions. Tuesday's gains brought the near-month soybean contract, for delivery in July, to within easy striking range of $ 8 a bushel for the first time since the spring of 1984. Eight of the nine soybean contracts finished limit up, as did the contracts for September and December delivery of oats and March delivery of corn, both of which carry a 10-cents-a-bushel limit. Wheat settled 9 -LCB- cents to 15 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.51 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 7 -RCB- cents to 10 cents higher with July at $ 2.24 \ a bushel; oats were 9 -RCB- cents to 10 cents higher with July at $ 1.82 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 18 -LCB- cents to 30 cents higher with July at $ 7.98 a bushel The soaring grain markets supported livestock and meat futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Unseasonably warm weather lent additional support to the pork bellies, which are sliced to make bacon and often end up in summertime bacon-lettuce-and-tomato sandwiches, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said `` The BLT season is probably what's got everybody pumped up about the bellies,'' he said. Live cattle settled .23 cent to .72 cent higher with the contract for delivery in June at 72.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent to .43 cent higher with August at 76.35 cents a pound; hogs settled .40 cent to the limit 1.50 cents higher with June at 54.77 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were up the 2-cents-a-pound limit across the board with July at 56.32 cents a pound. The higher agricultural commodity prices _ often perceived as an inflationary signal _ prompted hedge-type buying of gold and silver futures on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and heavy buying of platinum on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, analysts said. The dollar's relative weakness against foreign currencies has made platinum particularly attractive to Japanese and European investors, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Maseri </PERSON>, senior trader for <ORGANIZATION> JCC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Miami-based commodities brokerage. Platinum settled $ 25 to $ 33.70 higher with July at $ 610.90 a troy ounce. Gold was $ 3.50 to $ 4.20 higher with June at $ 455 a troy ounce; silver was 7 cents to 10 cents higher with June at $ 6.60 a troy ounce. Stock-index futures jumped sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 9.45 points higher at 262.95. Oil prices rose in light trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> but dealers were reluctant to take new positions in advance of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s June 8 meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, analysts said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents lower to 8 cents higher with July at $ 17.51 a barrel; heating oil was .06 cent to .45 cent higher with June at 48.23 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .04 cent to .40 cent higher with June at 52.95 cents a gallon.

 Stock traders celebrated their return from the three-day Memorial holiday on Tuesday with a buying spree that pushed the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average to its second biggest gain of the year. Analysts said there was no single piece of news to account for the surge, which came on the heaviest daily volume since late January, but they said the market's pessimism had grown so pervasive that a rebound was inevitable. `` Sometimes it's better just to enjoy and not analyze things like this,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a portfolio strategist for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's been a bad May.'' The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 10.31 points last Friday, climbed 74.68 to 2,031.12, its highest level since it closed at 2,036.31 on May 4. It was the biggest one-day advance in the market's most widely-followed index since a 76.42-point gain on Jan. 4, the first trading day of the year, and the sixth biggest rise ever. The gain in the Dow Jones industrials was so strong that a voluntary limit on computerized program trading was triggered when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION>'s rise swept past 50 points in the last hour of trading. But even after the so-called `` collar'' went into effect for the rest of the day, the blue-chip average extended its gain. It was the third time the collar had gone into effect since it was adopted in the aftermath of the Oct. 19 market crash in a bid to curb market volatility. Gainers outpaced losers by nearly 4 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,211 up, 333 down and 401 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> came to 247.61 million shares, up from 133.59 million in the previous session and the highest since 275.25 million shares were traded there on Jan. 25. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 271.55 million shares. The pace of trading has been slow in recent weeks as traders weighed the implications of continuing strength in the economy. While a strong economy could bode well for corporate profits, some investors worried that an expanding economy could also reignite inflation. While analysts were unable to pinpoint why the market surged Tuesday, they said several factors may have contributed to the big gain. They cited stability in the dollar and the bond market's resilience in the face of a new surge in commodity futures prices They also cited relief that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> had failed to boost its discount rate _ its interest charge on loans to financial institutions _ as some feared it would after the markets closed last week. <PERSON> Eldon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON>, a senior vice president at the brokerage Birr, <ORGANIZATION> Wilson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said there is `` an enormous amount of cash around out of the market'' due to wariness in the wake of last October's crash. `` But every time we get a little rally going, people think they will miss the boat and buy something,'' he said. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DaPuzzo </PERSON>, manager of retail equity trading for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the warm weather over the holiday may have prompted investors to reevaluate the market's prospects and put some cash to work. `` You've got to start a summer rally sometime, and Memorial Day is usually the threshold to the summer,'' he said. Two utility stocks that have a deadline soon for dividend eligibility accounted for more than a third of the trading activity on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Edison </LOCATION> was up -LRB- at 18 -RCB- on volume of 55.7 million shares, while <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> rose ~ to 23 ~ on volume of 36.8 million shares Among the blue chip issues, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 -LRB- to 27 -LRB-, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> rose 2 to 42, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> rose 4 -LCB- to 112 -LCB- and <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 -LCB- to 42. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> fell 2 \ to 70 \ after proposing to spin off its information services company and pay a special dividend to its <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> rose 10 -RCB- to 27 ~ after receiving an offer of $ 24 a share for 61 percent of its stock from a unit of <ORGANIZATION> Gurit-Heberlein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> According to <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively-traded stocks, the market rose $ 69.66 billion, or 2.75 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> index rose 4.38 to 148.04. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 10.12 to 302.67, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 8.74 at 262.16.

 It is only coincidence that a Taiwanese <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 that disintegrated and crashed in 1981 and an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 737 that lost part of its fuselage over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in April were built one after the other, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials said Tuesday. On April 28, a 20-foot section of the Aloha jet's forward upper fuselage ripped away at 24,000 feet. A flight attendant fell to her death and 61 passengers were injured, but the flight crew landed the plane safely. The Aloha plane was the 152nd 737-200 produced by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. Plane No. 151 was a <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> jet that disintegrated and exploded at 22,000 feet over central <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> on Aug. 22, 1981, killing all 110 people on board. The cause of the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident is still under investigation. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines flying older 737s to reinspect the aircraft. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> believes the Far Eastern crash was caused by maintenance problems, spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> said. Any similarities between that crash and the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident are `` a series of coincidences,'' <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said. At the time of the planes' manufacture in 1969, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> was turning out between two and three 737s a month, <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said. He said he knew of no other problems involving 737s made around that time. In an article Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> vice president and general manager for engineering, also said the consecutive aircraft numbers were coincidence. <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON> said that while both accidents involved a section of the fuselage that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> refers to as `` Section 43,'' there was nothing inherently wrong with that portion of the aircraft. <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON> told the Journal the Far Eastern 737 repeatedly was used to ship fish in open containers, and corrosive salt water may have gotten into the cargo hold. The newspaper said Far Eastern officials denied that charge and said fish were shipped only in non-leaking containers. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said Tuesday <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators also believe leaking salt water from fish shipments was the cause of the Far Eastern jet's corrosion. Gamble said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had issued a series of service bulletins on older 737s, including one in March 1978 recommending aircraft owners make additional inspections of fuselage skins for possible corrosion. On July 1, 1981, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> issued an airworthiness directive requiring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers to inspect older 737s. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had supplied kits to airlines to allow them to replace corroded skin on planes, <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said. A kit was delivered to Far Eastern in April 1980, `` which means they had those in their spare parts inventory considerably before that crash,'' but apparently was never used on the plane, he said. <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, to attend a conference on problems with aging aircraft and was not available for comment Tuesday, <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said. The three-day conference was called by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> after the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> incident to study safety issues involving older aircraft. <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, director of public relations for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, noted the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> also issued an airworthiness directive following the Far Eastern crash requiring inspections of 737 cargo holds. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Goto </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, said that as a result of the directive, <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON> made extensive repairs in 1983 to the 737 subsequently involved in the April incident. He said the work done on the wings and lower portion of the plane might have helped it stay together long enough to land. The twin-engine 737, which entered service in 1968, is the world's most popular commercial aircraft, with more than 2,000 ordered in five different models. One of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> airworthiness directives issued after the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident focuses on early models of 737s in which <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> used a cold-bonding process, in which structural parts of the fuselage were laminated together using an adhesive that cured at room temperature. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said he found a number of differences between the two accidents. The Far Eastern plane, for example, was 12 years old and had approximately 33,000 landings, while the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> jet was 20 years old and had about 90,000 landings. `` As best we know,'' the Far Eastern accident was caused by corrosion in the plane's cargo hold, while the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident involved the top of the plane, he said. `` But again, the appropriate thing is to see what the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> conclude before drawing all these analogies and comparisons,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> issues service bulletins on its aircraft to customers whenever it learns of a problem or the potential for one. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and other appropriate regulatory agencies also are notified, he said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> believes the issues presented in the Far Eastern case `` were known and addressed and adequately so'' by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> airworthiness directive.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that earnings rose 50 percent to a record $ 93 million in the first three months of this year. The corporation, known as <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, buys mortgages and repackages them into securities for sales to investors. Corporation officials attributed the earnings increase to a widening in the difference between what it pays to the investors and what it receives from the mortgages. Also, income taxes were reported at a lower rate because of a drop in the corporate tax rate. For the first quarter, net income was $ 93 million, or $ 5.65 per share of preferred stock and $ 83.06 per share of common stock, up from $ 62 billion, or $ 3.81 per share of preferred stock and $ 52.31 per share of common stock, for the same period in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1970 to increase the amount of money available for mortgages. Its preferred stock is owned by 3,000 savings institutions who are members of the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks. Its common stock is owned by the home loan banks.

 <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> is going after kiddie flyers, announcing Tuesday an expanded youth fare program for the summer to go along with a previously announced prize program for children to fly along with `` <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lion </ORGANIZATION>.'' The reduced fare will be in effect systemwide, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> said, more than doubling the number of markets in which the fare is available. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> already had matched youth fares announced May 16 by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> airlines in areas where it competed with the three. Delta, the nation's fourth largest airline, said the youth fares and a `` Fantastic Flyer'' program take effect Wednesday. The fares give children ages 2 through 17 who travel through Sept. 11 a special price when accompanied by adults who have purchased a non-refundable fare. One child may accompany each adult, following the same advance purchase and minimum stay rules in force with the adult's fare. The airline, which already has a marketing tie-in with <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Orlan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, expects most of the fares to include <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. For example, round-trip fares from cities east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> will be $ 97 on weekends and $ 77 for midweek travel. For travel from cities west of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, or between two cities outside the state of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the fares will be limited to midweek and are based of a mileage formula ranging from $ 58 to $ 198. Under the Fantastic Flyer program announced last week, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> will give prizes and other rewards to children between 2 and 12 years old. Calling Delta `` The Official Airline for Kids,'' <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president <PERSON> Whit </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said, `` On every <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> flight, children will receive a complimentary <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> visor ... a copy of the Fantastic Flyer Magazine featuring games, puzzles, stories and prizes created just for them.'' <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON> said the airline is after two groups of travelers, with its lower fares and Fantastic Flyer gambits: vacationers making trips with their children and unaccompanied children.

<HEAD>Icahn Charges Texaco Managers `Blundered'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, whose bid for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was rejected last week, on Tuesday charged the oil giant `` engaged in a continuing series of damaging managerial blunders.'' In an amended counterclaim in response to a lawsuit filed by <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> contends <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> `` deliberately concealed information -LRB- and -RRB- made false and misleading statements to its stockholders.'' <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement from its <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, headquarters that the counterclaim was `` utterly groundless.'' The company said it would respond in detail through the normal litigation process. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who offered to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> for $ 60 a share in a bid that values the company at $ 14.6 billion, complained that the company did not tell shareholders it offered him greenmail, which he has said he rejected. He also charged that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> condoned the misuse of corporate assets in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> real estate venture. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> approached him with a third-party buyer willing to pay $ 50 a share for his stake in the oil giant, and said he rejected the offer because it `` smacked of greenmail.'' In the original counterclaim, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and his affiliates claimed that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> and four directors made misleading statements in proxy material distributed to shareholders. The counterclaim charges the acts are `` part of a management scheme to entrench itself to the detriment of the stockholders.'' <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has launched his own proxy fight in an attempt to win five seats on <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors and has extended his tender offer until <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting on June 17. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> President and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON>, who is cited in <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s counterclaim along with three others, has been skeptical of <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s ability to finance the buyout. As <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> controls 14.8 percent of the oil giant's outstanding shares.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it would conduct an internal investigation in the wake of a federal judge's finding of sexual harassment at the agency's regional office here Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> ordered the agency to hire two outside counsel: one to investigate possible disciplinary action against <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> officials involved in the case and another to review the agency's equal employment procedures, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> McCue </PERSON>. The agency, meanwhile, is trying to reach a settlement with staff attorney <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, who won favorable judgment last month from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> on her sexual harassment suit. <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> found that Ms. <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> was forced to work in a `` sexually hostile'' atmosphere where male supervisors had romantic relationships with seceretaries, who received promotions and bonuses. The judge also ruled that Ms. <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> was passed over for promotions and given a negative evaluation after she complained. Emphasizing that the agency still has not decided whether to appeal <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>'s decision, Ms. <PERSON> McCue </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> lawyers are negotiating with Ms. <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>'s attorneys over how to resolve the case. <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> ordered both sides to submit proposals for compensating Ms. <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, remedies which could promotions and back pay. A hearing, which was scheduled for Wednesday, was postponed until June 16 to give both sides more time to discuss a way to resolve the case, Ms. <PERSON> McCue </PERSON> said. Following the ruling, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>, who became chairman last year, said he was distressed by the judge's decision. The events covered by the lawsuit occurred during the tenure of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S.R </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shad </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>'s predecessor who is now <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> found that <PERSON> Shad </PERSON> and the agency's executive director, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kundahl </PERSON>, were aware of Ms. <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>'s allegations in early 1984. A 1986 investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s equal employment opportunity office found `` no nexus between -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>'s -RRB- complaint and the other activities that were going on in the office.'' <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> concluded that two officials of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> regional office in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, made sexually suggestive remarks to Ms. <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>. He also concluded that the testimony of several officials was `` deserving little credence'' and in the case of one was was `` in material respects false and incredible.''

 The complex procedures by which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approves spending and tax plans are badly in need of reform including adoption of a two-year budget cycle, witnesses told a national commission Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to recommend ways to solve the government's budget woes, heard a variety of recommendations ranging from decreasing the number of congressional committees involved in budget writing to giving the president authority to refuse to spend money appropriated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But all of the witnesses cautioned the commission against spending too much time looking into the budget process, saying this was not the main flaw which has led to record federal deficits during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. `` Creation of the deficit was the result of a series of policy mistakes and miscalculations, both economic and political, that process changes probably would not have prevented,'' said <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivlin </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. `` Fixing the deficit requires having the political courage to face up to the problem and agree on a package of spending cuts and-or tax increases that will correct it,'' she said. The 12-member commission, headed by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, was holding its second public hearing with a goal of coming up with a set of recommendations for the new president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by Dec. 21. The witnesses Tuesday all recommended switching from the current annual budgets, which have tied up <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in unending debate, to a two-year budget cycle. `` A two-year budget approved in the first year of each congressional term would substantially reduce the current burden of preparing and approving budgets in both the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Niskanen </PERSON>, former member of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Niskanen </PERSON> also suggested that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had gone too far in restricting presidential power when it passed the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. That law prevented President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and his successors from simply refusing to spend money appropriated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Any such `` impoundment'' of funds would have to be specifically approved by a positive vote in both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` In effect, appropriations are now both a ceiling and a floor on spending and there is no way to run a complex organization under these constraints,'' <PERSON> Niskanen </PERSON> said. `` The restrictions on impoundment authority should be recognized as an overreaction to the abuses of presidential authority during the Watergate era.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, former executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he believed the government would have a `` substantially smaller deficit'' currently if the president still had authority to refuse to spend appropriated money. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said that any reforms should seek to make the process more understandable to the general public. `` The present process has descended into almost a cult of mysteries, reminiscent of the pagan cults of 2,000 years ago,'' he said. `` We need to change that so that more Americans can participate intelligently in this critical debate on fiscal policy and national priorities.'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> recommended combining many of the budgeting functions now shared by numerous congressional committees, restricting the types of amendments that can be offered to budget bills in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and giving the president the ability to veto individual items in a spending bill, a proposal long sought by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Rivlin </PERSON> suggested that the administration should consider consolidating its own budget functions now scattered between the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION> into a single Cabinet agency responsible to the president for overall economic policy-making. `` The creaky, over-burdened budget process badly needs simplification,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rivlin </PERSON> said. `` The commission could do a major national service by emphasizing this fact and pointing the parties in a constructive direction.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> testified Tuesday that inflation and world political events _ and not a plot by him and his brothers to corner the world silver market _ led prices to rocket in the late 1970s. In his first day of testimony in a multi-million dollar civil trial at federal court, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> essentially repeated assertions made by defense lawyers in their opening statements last February. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 62, his brothers <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 58, and <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 55, are being sued by a South American silver concern that claims the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tex </PERSON>. brothers conspired to corner the world silver market between September 1979 and January 1980. Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, a mineral marketing company owned by the Peruvian government, claim the Hunts and several co-defendants were responsible for the sharp rise in silver prices from about $ 9 an ounce to more than $ 50 an ounce. Minpeco claims the skyrocketing prices caused it to lose more than $ 100 million when the world silver market collapsed in March 1980, with prices falling back to about $ 10 an ounce. But the rotund elder Hunt brother claimed he began investing in silver bullion and silver futures because of `` continuing inflation and certain political events.'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, who said he began investing in silver in 1973, said that by the fall of 1979 he was still telling people that `` silver was an overall good investment.'' But 1979 was `` a very unsettling year politically,'' said <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, in a low <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> drawl, noting the Iranian revolution that ousted the shah and took American diplomats hostage in <LOCATION> Teheran </LOCATION>; a continuing increase in oil prices; the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the seizure of the Grand Mosque at Mecca by Islamic radicals. Hunt, whose legendary father, H.L. Hunt, made the family fortune in oil, said as oil prices began climbing _ to about $ 30 a barrel in late 1979 _ he bought more and more silver. But he claimed new commodity exchange rules limiting the number of futures contracts that could be held as well as increasing the amount to be put down on margin accounts `` was a difficult thing for the market.''

<HEAD>Brazil Announces Massive Oil Find</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> announced Tuesday the discovery of a massive oil deposit in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s far northern region that he said could be as large as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> reserves. `` We are certain we have found a region as rich in oil as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> told journalists late Tuesday. He did not give figures about the actual amount of oil thought to be in the zone. The remaining proven reserves of oil in the British continental shelf amount to 750 million metric tons, while the total remaining reserves could be as high as 4.12 billion metric tons, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s state-run <ORGANIZATION> Petrobras </ORGANIZATION> oil company and, under a risk contract, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> Oil of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have been exploring the <LOCATION> Marajo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> region in <LOCATION> Para </LOCATION> state, near the mouth of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. However, little more than one month ago <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> announced it had suspended its risk contract with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, which nevertheless has continued to drill in the region. In the 1970s, major offshore finds were made off the coast of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> state, bringing up <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s domestic oil production to 60 percent of consumption. Current production is around 600,000 barrels a day and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has cut its oil-import bill by billions of dollars annually. The newest oil find is 2,277 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. Because of the late hour of the announcement there was no one at <ORGANIZATION> Petrobras </ORGANIZATION> to comment.

 Striking scriptwriters and television and film producers failed to reach an agreement Tuesday to end the 11-week work stoppage that has shut down most Hollywood production, but they agreed to meet again Wednesday. A negotiating session with a federal mediator present began at 9 a.m. and ended shortly before 7:30 p.m., said to <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the 9,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> declined to characterize the session. `` We had sidebar sessions and caucuses, but there was no full committee negotiations _ although everyone was present,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman had said earlier that full committee bargaining had been expected to begin Tuesday afternoon. Both sides agreed to resume their meeting at 3 p.m. Wednesday. Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> added that picketing in the strike that opened March 7 would resume Wednesday morning at the Paramount studios in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. The sessions are being conducted under the auspices of Commissioner <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in suburban <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, 20 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

The talks followed a Memorial Day holiday weekend break during which both sides studied the impact of last week's overwhelming ratification by the writers' guild of a model contract with 73 independent producers. The independent contract, which permits immediate employment of an estimated 400 writers, covers such programs as `` The Cosby Show,'' and `` The Tonight Show with <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>.'' The three-year waiver contracts grant the writers' key demand: retention of the present formula for the residual payments that writers get for syndication of one-hour television shows. The union touted a split in management ranks, but alliance spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said the 73 independent contracts cover only a few guild members and none of the concerns involved were major companies.
