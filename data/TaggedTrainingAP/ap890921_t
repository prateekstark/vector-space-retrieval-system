 What's a hot tub doing at the Farm Science Review? `` The farmer likes hot tubs just as much as anyone does. We have a tendency to think the farmer is not a normal person. But of course he is,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fendrick </PERSON>, manager of the farm equipment exposition at the <ORGANIZATION> Molly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. Organizers of the three-day event say the 600-plus demonstrations and displays have changed over the years. `` We sat back and thought, ` How come we can attract the farmer but not his wife, his family, his neighbors?''' <PERSON> Fendrick </PERSON> said Wednesday. So along with tractor demonstrations and free samples of pesticide, the review offered tips on how to remove chocolate stains from linen, manage personal finances, update a wardrobe with inexpensive accessories and eat at Pizza Hut without gaining much weight. Information also was available on owning a bed-and-breakfast inn and breeding a pet llama. Ten or 15 years ago, the typical visitor at the review was white, male, between 50 and 60 years old, wore overalls and attended the event by himself. `` Today he's wearing designer jeans, his wife is with him, and she's usually pushing the stroller,'' <PERSON> Fendrick </PERSON> said. `` A lot of them out there are in their 30s.''

 At 6 a.m. one recent Thursday, Soun Sundary, gentle and serene at 21, gave birth to her first child and held her up to a <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> that has known only war for two decades. `` I do n't know about the future, whether there will be peace or not,'' she said as the sun shone into her hospital room after days of monsoon rains. She and her husband, <PERSON> Soun </PERSON> <PERSON> Rithy </PERSON>, 25, have spent most of their lives with their tragic nation in turmoil and mass deaths _ the civil war of 1970-75, the fanatical communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rule of 1975-78 and the fighting since <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded in late 1978. Seven members of their two families died in the murderous scourge of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> who defeated a pro-West government in 1975. The couple and their daughter are likely to see more killing in the years ahead, even though the Vietnamese are pulling out. Rithy had come to <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> for the birth of his child but is returning to southern <LOCATION> Koh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> province, where he has fought as a government soldier for seven years against the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and other guerrillas. Peace talks in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> have collapsed. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s pullout, due to be completed Sept. 26, will leave the Vietnamese-installed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> facing the guerrillas alone in what could be the war's most chaotic and violent phase. `` We would like to have peace, really,'' Vice Premier <PERSON> Kong </PERSON> <PERSON> Sam-Ol </PERSON> said in n interview. `` For almost 20 years, our people have known more about killing and war than peace.'' Most feared is the possibility that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s pullout will allow the return of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the black pajama-clad fighters who killed hundreds of thousands of people in torture chambers and slave labor camps after they took over in 1975. The government claims the army will have no problems handling the guerrillas. Many others do not feel as confident. Some <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> residents have been stocking rice in case supplies are cut off by escalating fighting, said <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanharith </PERSON>, editor of the government-sponsored weekly Kampuchea. Some senior government officials have told Western aid workers they are saving money in case they have to flee. `` They do n't know what is going to happen after September if there are problems with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>,'' one aid worker said. `` They believe if there are problems, the first problems would be for them.'' At <LOCATION> Kompong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chhnang </LOCATION>, just north of <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, Maj. <PERSON> Chhour </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandoeun </PERSON>, the provincial military commander, said his nine battalions are hard pressed in their fight against the 300 <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas in the area. `` They do n't stay in one place and we do n't know all their hiding places,'' he said. An aid official said the government's military draft appears to be widening. A few months ago, some parents forbade their sons to leave the house as overzealous recruiters yanked men off the streets. Some youths flee to the border with <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, only to be rounded up by the guerrillas for service. A 10 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew was lifted in April, but the climate of war still pervades this riverside capital. In July, authorities closed dance halls that had been packed nightly since they were permitted to open last year. Mayor <PERSON> Thong </PERSON> <PERSON> Khong </PERSON> blamed drunken quarrels and said only the rich could visit them anyway. `` At that time, there was increased fighting at the border and it was difficult to justify the sacrifice at the border and the good life in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>,'' one foreign-aid official said. For many years, popular support for the Vietnamese-backed government had stemmed mostly from its being the only alternative to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. With <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s pullout, <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> extended economic reforms to include a freeing up of private trade in an effort to raise primitive living conditions. Ironically, it created a new security problem by worsening corruption among officials, and corruption was a factor that helped the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> topple <PERSON> Lon </PERSON> <PERSON> Nol </PERSON>'s pro-West government in 1975. The reforms reduced somewhat the gulf between the people and their leaders But in addition to the fear of more war remains the widespread fear of the authorities and `` the police,'' who are thought to be everywhere.

 As though the constant shelling is n't enough, residents of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> now face marauding bands of gunmen who loot abandoned apartments or rob those huddling in bomb shelters. Here is another in a series of periodic reports on life in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Long-suffering residents of this beleaguered capital have braved six months of shelling and shortages only to face a new terror _ bunker bandits. Bands of gunmen prowl the streets of Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> at night, cleaning out apartments hit in the artillery battles between the Syrians and Christian forces. They grab anything salvageable: Persian carpets, television sets, video recorders, silverware. It's not unusual to hear the crackle of automatic weaponsfire at night, as the marauders fire in the air to keep people away from the scenes of their depredations. They also prey on civilians huddling in basement shelters during the shelling because many people take their savings and jewelry with them when they go underground. One gang of masked gunmen robbed six families in a bunker beneath their apartment block in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Aishe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bakkar </LOCATION> neighborhood. `` I do n't know how they managed to get in during the shelling,'' said one of the victims, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Samir </PERSON>, a middle-aged Sunni Moslem taxi driver. `` They just ordered us to hand over our jewelry, money and watches and we had to do as they said,'' he said. `` I do n't know which is the worst: getting robbed in our own shelter, or the shelling.'' The number of reported robberies has gone down in recent weeks because about 1.3 million of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s 1.5 million people have fled to safer areas to escape the nightly barrages that have killed more than 900 people and wounded nearly 2,800 since March 8. But the thousands of abandoned apartments make easy pickings. Some residents now take pistols to their shelters to protect themselves against the looters. Other indirect victims of the violence are hundreds of Sri Lankan maids stranded in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> by fleeing employers who order them to guard apartments and houses. `` I risk my life here during the shelling, looking after their carpets and silverware while they're safe somewhere and having fun in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' said a bitter <PERSON> Kumari </PERSON> <PERSON> Hami </PERSON>, left to fend for herself in an eighth floor apartment in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` I'd rather starve in my own country than be here,'' she said. Her countrywomen, along with Filipinas and women from other poor <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries, came to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> hoping to make a decent living. Most are paid $ 50 a month. She said most employers make sure the maids do not flee by taking their passports. Unable to leave <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, they're left alone and frightened amid the daily artillery battles. Some are among the casualties, but police said they have no specific figures. <PERSON> Fadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinno </PERSON>, who runs an office that hires Sri Lankans to work in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said about 2,000 women share <PERSON> Kumari </PERSON>'s plight. `` Their employers leave them in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> because thieves usually rob empty apartments,'' he said. `` The maids come to me crying, but there's nothing we can do about it because they're bound by their contracts.'' The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> government has evacuated more than 200 Filipinas who were stranded in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, some complaining they had been forced into prostitution. Many have been made destitute by the 14-year-old civil war that has destroyed <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s economy, but the latest round of fighting has brought a boom for scrap metal merchants. In the <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> district of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, junkyard owners like <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wehbi </PERSON> are out in the rubble-strewn streets every day in their trucks as soon as there's a lull in the shelling. They scavenge among wrecked cars, shrapnel and bombed-out apartments for battered metal household items. `` We only care about copper pieces of shrapnel,'' <PERSON> Wehbi </PERSON> said during a recent sweep through west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` Iron ones are n't worth the trouble of collecting because they do n't bring in much money.'' He said when he sees a smoldering car, he usually looks for the owner to buy it. `` The most I'll pay for such a car is 15,000 -LRB- Lebanese -RRB- pounds -LRB- $ 30 -RRB-,'' he said. But people in some neighborhoods said dealers usually just tow the blackened, shrapnel-holed hulks away without bothering to ask about ownership. <PERSON> Wehbi </PERSON> said that after the metal is compressed it is shipped to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and some Arab countries through the southern ports of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> and Tyre to be melted down and used to make household appliances and ammunition. `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> takes copper for ammunition. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> take brass for electrical appliances,'' he said. Pointing to a large shipping container, <PERSON> Wehbi </PERSON> said: `` That's more than half full of empty beer cans. People are drinking more because they're nervous and because there's no water. It's all good for business.''

<HEAD>12-Year-Old Raises $587 for Bullet-Proof Vests for Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRISTOL, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police thanked a 12-year-old boy for raising $ 587 to buy them two bulletproof vests. Seventh-grader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said he learned of the dangers facing police officers when he read a magazine article describing how a bulletproof vest saved an officer's life. He visited the police department, where he learned that the department had only enough of the $ 300 vests for about a third of its officers. So, he placed jars for contributions in stores, raising about $ 300. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, whose father is a doctor, then got more than $ 200 from doctors at <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted Monday to let the police department buy two vests with the $ 587 he raised. `` He did it on his own,'' Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Killiany </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` We're very appreciative of the efforts of this youth.'' It was n't <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>' first contribution to the city. He has volunteered to help senior citizens and with clients of the <ORGANIZATION> Bristol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Retarded _ and now he's looking for more volunteer work. `` I'll find something,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The death toll from a powerful typhoon that hit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s east coast over the weekend has risen to 162, with 354 people still missing, an official newspaper reported today. The <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily, quoting flood control officials in <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> province, said 692 people were injured and property losses from Typhoon Vera were estimated at $ 350 million. The typhoon, the most powerful to hit the province in 27 years, flooded 857,000 acres of farmland and washed out 40,000 acres of crops. Earlier television newscasts showed toppled buildings, flattened fields and workers rebuilding the shoreline with stones and sandbags. <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION>, located just south of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, was also hit by torrential storms this July that killed 122 people and caused economic losses of $ 405 million. `` These natural calamities have brought appalling losses to the province's people and property as well as to its industrial and agricultural base,'' the flood control headquarters said. Last year, summer storms in the disaster-prone province killed an estimated 400.

 <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s was surprised when a well-preserved, 67-year-old teddy bear sold for a record $ 86,000. So was the buyer. `` His first words were, ` You're kidding','' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who was an intermediary in the deal, said Wednesday. However, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said, his <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> friend was prepared to pay even more and was delighted to bag the bear as a 42nd anniversary present for his wife. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> refused to identify the buyer. The actual bidding was done by stockbroker <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, who was given a blank check and sent to <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Tuesday. `` I could tell from his voice he was ashen,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said, `` and he said ... the auction's just over and I've got the bear.' `` And I said ` well done, <PERSON> James </PERSON>' and then he said ` you'd better sit down because I paid 50,000 -LRB- pounds -RRB-.' `` And I said ` You've done what?!''' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said he waited a few hours before phoning his American friend. `` I guess he might have figured on a third'' of that record price, said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who is chairman of the House of Nisbet teddy bear manufacturers in <LOCATION> Weston-super-Mare </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` He's is very pleased. He was determined to have it.'' The buyer and his wife are avid teddy-bear collectors, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said, and both happen to be as old as the record-breaking bear. The price is nearly five times the previous highest price for a teddy bear and 61 times its catalogue estimate, said <PERSON> Bunny </PERSON> <PERSON> Campione </PERSON>, a valuer for <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said his firm would like to do a replica of the bear. `` It's up to my friend, although it seems like we have the inside track,'' he said. The previous highest auction price for a teddy bear was $ 19,000 paid at a Christie's auction in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on May 18 for a Steiff bear made between 1906 and 1909 for Princess <LOCATION> Xenia </LOCATION>, a cousin of Czar <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. Several bidders stayed in the race until the price reached $ 38,000, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` The other bidder after 24,000 pounds -LRB- $ 38,000 -RRB- was a telephone bidder and the general impression was that the caller was from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` Bears are an art form like paintings,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` People are used to hearing about crazy figures like $ 400 million for paintings and this is the same kind of price inflation. It is a very rare bear.'' The German-made teddy, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> is thought to date from 1927. The bear is 24 inches long, has dual-plush fur in blond and brown, amber and black glass eyes measuring about 1 inch in diameter, swivel joints, a humped back and widely spaced pricked ears. It is believed that it was part of a batch of a few thousand, but Mrs. <PERSON> Campione </PERSON> said the bear was in unusually good condition. Before going to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the bear will on display at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teddy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stratford-upon-Avon </LOCATION> this weekend.

<TEXT>
 The new show `` Miss Saigon'' received a rapturous ovation at the Theater Royal, <PERSON> Drury </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, followed by decidedly mixed early reviews for the first major musical set mostly in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` For all its frenzied breast-beating, this is a show with about as much heart as the Tin Man in ` The Wizard of Oz,''' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> in The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> wrote of the musical, which updates the tragic tale of <PERSON> Puccini </PERSON>'s `` Madame Butterfly'' opera to the Vietnam War. <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON>, an 18-year-old Filipino making her acting debut in the West, and Welsh actor <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryce </PERSON> star as a young Vietnamese girl, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, and her cynical pimp, The Engineer. Both yearn for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ she to escape her war-torn country, he to exploit what he refers to sardonically in a second-act showstopper as `` the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> plays the American GI who weds <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> in 1975 prior to the fall of <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> only to leave her for a new life, and a new <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> bride. The story reaches its fatal climax in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> in 1978, with the implication that innocence, as embodied by <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, can not be reclaimed. <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pryce </PERSON> both received cheers from the black-tie audience Wednesday night that gave `` Miss Saigon'' an eight-minute standing ovation. But alongside the applause came concerns about the hype, with some wondering whether this was n't another in a series of effects-heavy, overhyped British productions that substitute impressive mechanics for meaningful emotion. Said The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>: `` It gives the impression of having been cynically concocted _ with lavish high-tech decor as the most important ingredient _ merely to fill theater seats.'' <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Middlehurst </PERSON> in Today newspaper wrote: `` There's more to a musical than the -LRB- money -RRB- it cost <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON> to create such stunts as landing helicopters on stage and building giant statues of Ho Chi Minh ... `` Both these staging coups received extensive advance publicity in the British press and elicited more applause than most of the musical numbers. Problems installing the 22-foot statue of <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Minh </PERSON>, reported to weigh almost two tons, had led to the cancellation of the first two previews Sept. 4 and 5. But the opening night proceeded without technical difficulty. Budgeted at $ 4.65 million, `` Miss Saigon'' will most likely withstand any critical slights. Its advance sale to date is almost $ 8 million, and a Broadway opening is tentatively scheduled for late autumn, 1990, with director <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hytner </PERSON> repeating his <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> assignment. `` Miss Saigon'' marks another commercial hit for millionaire producer <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON>, whose shows, besides `` <LOCATION> Les </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miserables </LOCATION>,'' include `` Cats'' and `` The Phantom of the Opera,'' two internationally successful <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> musicals. But the producer said in a pre-opening interview that he is forsaking mega-musicals for a while to turn his attention to <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s upcoming film version of `` Les Miserables.''

 It was billed as a gathering of world-renowned intellectuals tackling the loftiest of subjects and perhaps coming up with a metaphor for our times. But while participants in the modestly named <PERSON> Conversazioni </PERSON> on Culture and Society considered changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION>, the influence of religion in world events and cultural illiteracy, the larger assignment proved elusive. `` Everybody was satisfied but no final metaphor, alas, emerged,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, chief columnist for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>. In an introduction to the conference, <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Veliz </PERSON>, a conference host, noted such past `` eloquent and economical'' tags as `` Roaring 20s,'' `` Neo-Gothic,'' and even `` Cold War,'' but lamented that `` today we are encumbered with ` post-industrial' and ` post-modern,' usages as illuminating as ` post-life' is for death or ` post-oats' for porridge. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, one of many academics, historians and others who joined a debate of world issues, did not seem defeated by the group's failure to write a tag line for the closing years of the 20th century. `` The whole idea is that we thrash out these things,'' he said. The third annual conference, held this year at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, brought together such thinkers as former presidential advisor <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Gellner </PERSON> and noted French historian <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladurie </PERSON> to work on `` A Metaphor for Our Times.'' The conference invited about 60 top thinkers. Several papers were presented Sunday and positions taken on the best name for the present era. During dinner discussion groups and public presentations, the participants defended and attacked each others reasoning. The papers were revised and a final session was held Tuesday night. `` I do n't think the idea of the metaphor was ... built into the idea. It was just a way of saying, ` What do we think of our condition?''' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> pointed in his presentation to the drug epidemic, the collapse of form in the arts and `` the old certainties vanishing and nothing being put in their place'' to coin `` The Age of Disorder.'' The points he raised provoked considerable discussion and, he said, a degree of accord, particularly his position that cultural literacy would someday return. ` I had said that our time is the only one that would in fact try to define itself,'' he added. `` Obviously any era, the ` Dark Ages,' the ` Age of Enlightenment,' is not called that when it happens. We're the first age to try and define itself right now, rather than waiting for history.'' American economist <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostow </PERSON> talked of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s plans for dropping border restrictions in 1992 and offered `` The Age of Regionalism. <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> gave an overview of how the world became what it is, while <PERSON> Ladurie </PERSON>'s presentation was non-political and more abstract, dealing with the `` nature of the world,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Veliz </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, focused on the domination of the English language and English culture throughout the wolrd. He noted how soccer, or English football, is played throughout the world. He also displayed a group photograph in which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s late leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeni </PERSON> and his fellow ayotollahs wore jogging shoes. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Botsford </PERSON>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> correspondent for the Independent in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said one series of discussions focused on the fact that 15 years ago no one would have predicted that religion would affect politics in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, or that Islam and fundamentalism would dominate headlines. `` Religion came in a startling second to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and really was talked about a great deal,'' he said.

<HEAD>House Panel Defeats Emission Averaging Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A `` very upset'' auto industry predicts many more recalls will result from the swift collapse of a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration plan to let carmakers meet pollution targets by averaging vehicle emissions. A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee removed the averaging plan from the president's clean air bill Wednesday, in a unanimous voice vote that shocked a standing-room crowd that expected a closely divided tally. The vote means the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bill would require each car sold in this country to pass anti-pollution requirements for hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide. Current law has the car-by-car requirement, but the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan would make the standards tougher to meet. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> MacCarthy </PERSON>, of the auto industry's <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the new standards would be too tough for each car to meet after they're driven for several years. The industry _ and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ wanted to allow some engine classes to flunk the requirements, while other classes would meet them with room to spare, resulting in an overall pollution reduction after the emissions were averaged. <PERSON> MacCarthy </PERSON> predicted that once an engine class began regularly failing emissions tests, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> would order massive recalls for repairs. Subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., the chief proponent of eliminating averaging, said the concept would simply allow more dirty cars on the road `` Averaging provisions would cause more pollution,'' he said, because emissions from cars failing to meet the standards would not offset the gains from autos bettering the requirements. The subcommittee vote had a bizarre quality, because the two chief sponsors of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> measure _ Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>. and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION> _ vigorously defended averaging at the outset of debate But as one subcommittee member after another argued averaging was a bad idea misunderstood by the public, the defense stopped. The voice vote was taken with only `` ayes'' heard, and nobody sought a roll call to record individual members. Rep. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, D-Ill., sponsor of the anti-averaging amendment, said it may be possible to work out a modified averaging proposal later But <PERSON> MacCarthy </PERSON> said the averaging idea `` suffered a mortal wound.'' `` We are very upset by the removal of the averaging provision,'' <PERSON> MacCarthy </PERSON> said. `` It takes away our flexibility to deal with some very severe requirements in the bill.'' After the vote, <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, the powerful chairman of the full <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who moments earlier defended averaging, told reporters that it `` appears existing law is working satisfactorily'' without averaging, and that if the administration wanted the concept it could impose it without legislation. Asked why averaging was needed, he said, `` I did not advocate that particular point of view.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant administrator for air programs, said the averaging idea was devised in the White House and not by <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said he had no indication that <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> had any reservations. `` We did n't give any signals'' that the administration was willing to drop averaging, he added. `` I was surprised. I did not expect this would happen.'' Current law requires auto and light truck exhausts to meet a standard of 0.41 gram per mile for hydrocarbons such as unburned fuel, 1 gram per mile for nitrogen oxides and 3.4 grams for carbon monoxide. Cars sold in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> must meet even tougher standards. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> legislation would make the 49-state standards 0.25 gram per mile for hydrocarbons, 0.7 gram for nitrogen oxides and leave carbon monoxide unchanged at 3.4 grams. Today's exhaust limits represent reductions of 96 percent in hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide and 75 percent in nitrogen oxides from the uncontrolled cars of the 1960s and earlier. But environmentalists note that cars are still the main contributor to urban smog and argue that they account for 50 percent of cancer deaths due to toxic emissions.

<HEAD>Frank Won't Resign Pending Ethics Investigation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> says it would be `` a great mistake'' and `` cowardly'' to resign in the midst of a scandal over his involvement with a male prostitute. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat broke two days of public silence on his case Wednesday to declare his resolve to ride out the scandal, at least until the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee completes its inquiry into the case. He disputed reports that <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and congressional leaders were urging him to step aside in order to save them further embarrassment and risk partisan damage. `` I have n't been asked by anybody to resign,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. `` No one has been urging me to resign.'' A leading ally of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, meanwhile, backed off plans to draft and circulate for the signature of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> colleagues a statement supporting <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s desire to stay in office through the ethics probe. Rep. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON>, D-Mass., dean of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s home-state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> delegation, had planned such a statement But his press secretary, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON> decided press attention has been so negative for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> that it was `` better to do nothing.'' `` He's not running away from <LOCATION> Barney </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a five-term <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member and leading liberal in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, is an acknowledged homosexual who has come under scrutiny since admitting last month that he had an 18-month relationship with male prostitute <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> admitted paying <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> for sex, then hiring him as a driver and personal assistant. <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>, who went public with his allegations last month, contended that he operated a prostitution ring out of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> apartment with <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s knowledge. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> denied knowing of such activity and said he threw <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> out when he learned of it. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> asked for the ethics committee review, heading off a certain request by opponents. `` I think that resignation would be a great mistake,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. `` It would cut off the ethics committee process, and I think that would be a cowardly and inappropriate way to proceed. `` There are things that I did that I should not have done, that I've apologized for, and I will submit to the judgment of the ethics committee,'' he said. `` There are other things that I've been accused of that I have n't done that I want to be able to rebut, and the ethics committee is the place to do that.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> also responded to a partisan attack leveled by House Republican Leader Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Illinois </PERSON>, who suggested that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> was benefiting from a double standard that judged him less harshly, either because he was a liberal or because the allegations involved activity with another man rather than a woman. `` I do n't think it's fair to suggest the ethics committee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would be imposing a double standard. They've been very tough in the past. So I think that's just an inaccurate accusation,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. Over the weekend <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>, long an editorial supporter of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, called on him to resign. Democratic National Chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> on Tuesday acknowledged that `` pressure is building'' for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s resignation but said the ethics investigation should go forward. Asked if he was hurting the party, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> responded: `` At this point I think it's important to have the ethics process go forward. Then, people can make judgments after that.''

<TEXT>
 With a commander waving flowers in the lead, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on Thursday began a pledged final withdrawal from an 11-year war against guerrillas it could n't eradicate despite superior firepower. Vehicles carrying thousands of soldiers bearing rifles rumbled out of this northwestern province after a band played pop music and thousands of Cambodians threw the troops flowers and flags in a government-organized ceremony. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says it is conducting a six-day withdrawal of its last 26,000 troops from Siem Reap and several otehr areas of the country. But guerrillas charged that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was faking the troop movement and actually hiding and disguising its troops. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> on Christmas Day 1978 and within two weeks toppled the fanatical <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime, a former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> comrade that had launched bloody attacks on the Vietnamese border. During its four-year rule, the Pol Pot-led <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians as it tried to turn <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> into an agrarian commune. At the height of its conflict with <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> guerrillas, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> had 200,000 men in the country, according to Vietnamese officers. They say it began annual partial pullouts in 1982 and that 55,300 Vietnamese died fighting the Cambodians, including 25,000 in 1977-78. The invasion also brought economic blockades by non-Communist countries that kept <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> one of the world's poorest counties. With the collapse of peace talks in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> last month, the pullout would leave the Vietnamese-installed <ORGANIZATION> Phnom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penh </ORGANIZATION> government fighting three guerrilla groups backed by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and other countries. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Huol </PERSON> <PERSON> Savorn </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s 4th <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION>, said he expected a major guerrilla offensive after the pullout of the some 10,000 soldiers of `` Front 479'' from Siem Reap, <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Oddar </PERSON> <PERSON> Meanchey </PERSON> provinces. These are among Thai border provinces the guerrillas have been strongly contesting for years. `` They are going to fight a lot'' to try to occupy border areas before striking inland, he told reporters. `` But they will not be able to achieve this,'' he said `` With the equipment that they have, they can only carry out hit-and-run attacks.'' The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> talks failed to agree on international monitoring of the troop movement, and the only official foreign observers seen in Siem Reap were from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and its close allies <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the main source of arms for the war. Of the absence of Western observers, Soviet delegate and <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Genrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinreed </PERSON> said `` it was astonishing why they insisted -LRB- on international monitoring -RRB- but did n't come.'' His four-member team was led by <PERSON> Suleimenov </PERSON> <PERSON> Oljas </PERSON>, member of the Supreme Soviet, or parliament. About 50 journalists from non-Communist countries watched the troop movement. The Cambodians bade the soldiers farewell in a two-hour ceremony on the rain-soaked gravel road outside a kindergarten built by Vietnamese soldiers. Banners expressing sadness at the troops' departure and hopes for continued Vietnamese-Cambodian `` solidarity'' were raised by groups of students, soldiers, and schoolchildren wearing red kerchiefs _ the `` young pioneers'' of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Cambodian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. They sweated under a hot sun that charged in just after a morning mist lifted. On a wooden stage with the military officers, four <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks in flowing saffron robes chanted prayers for peace. Cambodian and Vietnamese officials took turns with speeches that denounced the `` Pol Pot genocide'' and defiantly claimed the guerrillas can not take any territory. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Anh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lon </PERSON>, commander of Front 479, hugged a <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> commander in front of a blue banner displaying the national emblems of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s yellow star and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Angkor Wat temple. A young pioneer gave him her kerchief while three women in traditional costumes presented a bouquet of flowers. The general walked down the muddied road, picked up a young boy, and climbed into his weather-beaten U.S.-made jeep to begin the withdrawal. The Vietnamese troops, whose intervention triggered fighting that killed tens of thousands of people and split almost all <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> into two hostile camps, waved yellow and purple flowers as they disappeared down the road.

<HEAD>Unusual Protein in Skin May Help in Alzheimer's Diagnosis and Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A protein found in the brain of Alzheimer's patients has been located elsewhere in their bodies, and that may lead to better diagnosis and treatment of the disease that afflicts 2 -LCB- million Americans The protein deposits appear in several tissues, including the skin and intestines, indicating they may come from an unknown substance that circulates in the blood, said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Selkoe </PERSON>, co-director of the Center for <ORGANIZATION> Neurologic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diseases </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. If so, finding ways to block delivery to the brain may help in fighting Alzheimer's disease, he reported today. But he said it is too early to know if such an approach would be useful. And another scientist said the research provides only suggestive evidence for the idea that the protein deposits come from a blood-borne source. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Drachman </PERSON>, chairman of the medical and scientific advisory board of the <ORGANIZATION> Alzheimer </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, also said it is unproven that the protein's appearance in the brain plays any role in causing Alzheimer's. Nonetheless, he called the study `` a very important advance'' in knowledge about the protein, which is called amyloid. <PERSON> Selkoe </PERSON>, who is also associate professor of neurology at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, reported the findings in the British journal Nature with colleagues <PERSON> Catharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mori </PERSON>. Even if no circulating substance is involved in the protein deposits, the work suggests that doctors may one day be able to confirm an Alzheimer's disease diagnosis by taking skin samples, <PERSON> Selkoe </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Drachman </PERSON> said data from the study suggest such a test would be unreliable, but that perhaps the accuracy can be improved. Alzheimer's disease attacks the brain and produces progressive impairment in memory, thinking and behavior. It kills more than 100,000 Americans a year. No cause or cure is known. Doctors now have no standard biological test to confirm the diagnosis in a living patient. They can only rule out other possible causes, including treatable ones, for suggestive symptoms. A standard feature in the brain of Alzheimer's victims is a large number of spherical neuritic plaques, composed partly of the amyloid protein. Scientists do not know whether the plaques cause the disease or simply result from it. Brains of Alzheimer patients also contain deposits of amyloid alone, which is what the new study found in other tissues, <PERSON> Selkoe </PERSON> said. Eight of 11 Alzheimer patients showed patchy amyloid deposits in the skin, subcutaneous tissue or intestines, with suggestive evidence of such deposits in two others. Three of 26 people without Alzheimer's showed the deposits, with two showing equivocal evidence. The three with deposits were at least 77 years old. <PERSON> Selkoe </PERSON> noted that elderly people without Alzheimer's also can have plaques in the brain, although they have fewer plaques than Alzheimer patients. The findings imply that the amyloid deposits either are created independently at multiple sites in the body or derived from some substance that circulates in the blood, he said. <PERSON> Selkoe </PERSON> said he favors the latter idea. Other kinds of amyloid come from such a circulating precursor, and some newly found deposits were in or near blood vessel walls, much as they can appear in the brain, he said. Nobody has yet identified a circulating substance that can be demonstrated to give rise to the form of amyloid linked to Alzheimer's, <PERSON> Selkoe </PERSON> said. He also said further study is planned to see if skin sampling might be useful to confirm a diagnosis of the disease.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is supporting efforts to retain catastrophic medical insurance for retirees amid growing indications that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may bow to pressure to repeal the program. `` Catastrophic meets a very real need in protecting senior citizens against financial ruin'' as a result of an illness, Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Although some adjustments may be needed, he added, `` repeal would be a big mistake.'' But leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged Wednesday the number of lawmakers who will vote to repeal the program outright is growing. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, an author of the program and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> probably will vote for repeal. Democratic leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agreed to allow a repeal vote next week when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> considers a <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plan for keeping catastrophic care but scaling the program back. The program, the largest expansion ever of Medicare, is under attack from two groups of retirees: those who already are covered by a catastrophic plan, including federal retirees; and higher-income older Americans who object to paying for coverage for those at the bottom of the economic ladder. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said that although the administration prefers no changes in the program, it would support a modification backed by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders of both parties. That proposal would eliminate coverage for most prescription drugs; scale back coverage of physicians' fees, and reduce the surtax on higher-income retirees that pays for most of the program. `` We want to do everything we can to preserve the core benefits'' in the program, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> told the committee. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should repeal the program and consider a replacement as part of an overall national health strategy Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said any discussion of repeal should include recognition that `` people's lives are at stake.'' Repeal, he said, would amount to `` denying somebody the right to get an operation in a hospital and allow them to live ... without going bankrupt.''

The new rules imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> 103 explosion include a requirement that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines operating in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> X-ray or physically search all checked luggage. A certain percentage of the luggage is searched by hand. The new <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> regulations apply only to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers. Air carriers operating in and out of 40 high-risk airports are required to make `` a positive passenger-baggage match,'' designed to ensure that no piece of luggage gets on an airplane unless the passenger who checked it is also aboard. And the installation of automatic devices for detecting explosives in checked luggage has begun, with the first installed at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> F. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The Thermal Neutron Analysis Machine costs $ 750,000 to $ 1 million. `` We have issued a rule requiring airlines to provide devices like this and have them installed in 40 airports here and abroad within 1 -LCB- years,'' <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. Asked whether the explosive-sniffer could have detected the bomb hidden in a radio-cassette player which blew the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 airliner apart, <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said: `` We are confident it could have caught it.'' <ORGANIZATION> ATA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Neale </PERSON> was not so sure. `` It's hard to say,'' he said. `` We still do n't know for sure exactly what happened there. It's like a moving target, you are constantly readjusting.'' Airline security originally was designed to counter hijackings of planes, mainly to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` Now, it's an entirely different threat, it's more sabotage than hijacking,'' said <PERSON> Neale </PERSON>. `` Defenses have to be changed and the new requirements are intended to do that.'' There is no single answer to terrorism, he said. `` The idea is to set up a new series of roadblocks.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines are frustrated, he said, because there is a perception among the traveling public that flying a foreign carrier is safer. But, he said, `` the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers are the only ones physically inspecting and X-raying all checked luggage now.'' Overseas airlines, he said, use the `` profile'' system in which added attention is paid to a passenger who has behavior patterns or matches statistical data characteristic of hijackers.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> cooly flashed a sign of the devil and muttered the word `` evil'' after jurors convicted him of all 13 murders and 30 other felonies in the 1985 satanism-tinged `` Night Stalker'' rampage. The glum, shaggy-haired drifter refused to stay in the courtroom when jurors returned their verdicts Wednesday after 22 days of deliberations. The jury found that <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> was the devil-worshiping `` Night Stalker'' who left satanic symbols at some murder scenes and forced terrified victims to `` swear to Satan'' as they suffered unspeakable assaults. Husbands were murdered in their beds and wives were raped beside the dead bodies. One victim's eyes were gouged out. The verdicts came four years after the killings terrified many Californians and more than a year after the trial began. When <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> was caught, it was by angry residents who ran him down and beat him. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, listened to the verdicts on a speaker in a nearby cell. As he was taken from the courthouse while wearing sunglasses, <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> flashed photographers a `` devil sign,'' extending his index and little finger. Asked what he thought about the verdicts, the 29-year-old <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said only: `` Evil.'' The trial's finale came despite a juror's slaying, which had threatened to halt the case during deliberations. In a silent courtroom, <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON> and clerk <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> spent more than a half hour reading the jury's thick book of verdicts. The word `` guilty'' echoed again and again. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> was convicted of all charges, including rape, sodomy, oral copulation, burglary and attempted murder. In addition, the jurors found 18 special circumstances existed, making it possible to impose the death penalty. In one of the murders, the panel reduced a charge of first-degree murder to second degree, a decision the prosecutor praised as `` sophisticated.'' The victim in that murder, <PERSON> Tsai-Lian </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu </PERSON>, was dragged from her car on a street and shot to death, indicating a lack of premeditation. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> still faces an attempted murder charge in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and a murder charge in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. His status in those cases will be decided after sentencing in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> case. <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON> scheduled the penalty phase of the trial to begin Sept. 27. The same jury will decide the sentence. The judge forbade the jurors from talking about the case. `` We're going to try to save his life,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said of the penalty proceeding. `` We will try to convince the jury that he should not be executed.'' The defense had argued <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> was a victim of mistaken identity, that the victims were too traumatized to remember their assailant's face <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> characterized <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>' reaction to the verdicts as `` kind of stoic.'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said he would appeal, citing the juror's slaying as one reason for overturning the conviction. On Aug. 14, juror <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> was found beaten and shot to death. Her live-in boyfriend confessed to the killing in a note written before he committed suicide. The slaying was not related to the case, but defense lawyers unsuccessfully asked for a mistrial, arguing that the killing had made the other jurors prejudiced against <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>. Relatives of three `` Night Stalker'' victims were in the packed courtroom and listened somberly to the verdicts. Outside court, Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> said, `` I'm satisfied that certainly the jury considered the evidence very carefully and rendered appropriate verdicts.'' But he added, `` I'm not going to be relieved until its over, and it's not over yet.'' He said he would urge jurors to impose the death penalty. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> conceded that the most powerful evidence against <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> came from attack survivors who wept and sometimes shouted at the defendant as they recalled their ghastly ordeals from the witness stand. `` You son of a bitch, why did you kill him?'' cried one woman who witnessed her husband's slaughter. `` I gave you everything you wanted. ... What's wrong with you? ... He was such a nice man.'' Through it all, <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> sat slumped in a chair, occasionally smirking and once laughing as a foreign-born witness struggled to describe her rape.

<HEAD>Federal Crop Insurance Most Equitable Way to Aid Farmers, Report
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal crop insurance program needs improvements, but it is a better way to provide disaster aid to farmers than emergency loans and direct payments, a congressional report says. And a government commission says some changes could be made immediately in the crop insurance program to boost farmer participation beyond the current 25 percent. The program needs to be simplified and made more responsive, and the administration could be improved, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Classen </PERSON>, co-chairmen of the Commission for the Improvement of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Wednesday. A <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report said the federal government spent $ 17.6 billion between 1980 and 1988 assisting farmers who lost crops because of drought or other natural causes. About $ 6.9 billion of that was direct assistance, $ 6.4 billion came through emergency loan programs and $ 4.3 billion was spent to subsidize crop insurance. However, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the crop insurance program is a more equitable and efficient way to provide aid to farmers. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said its investigation showed that most farmers do n't buy crop insurance because they are used to having <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> come to the rescue with special assistance whenever there is a major crisis. For example, $ 4 billion in direct payments were made in 1988 by emergency act of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because of the severe drought, said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., who chairs the subcommittee on conservation, credit and rural development, said 65 percent to 70 percent participation in the crop insurance program is needed to make it work `` We can not continue to do this,'' English said, referring to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' ad hoc approach to agricultural disasters. `` The costs are too high.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harman </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, said that in examining disaster assistance programs, his agency found that direct payments or emergency loans can result in different treatment for similarly affected disaster victims. `` In contrast, the terms of compensation under crop insurance are determined before a disaster occurs and therefore, crop insurance provides farmers equitable assistance more consistently,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> also found that crop insurance, because it is consistently available, allows farmers more flexibility in long-range planning. `` We recognize that the crop insurance program has had a history of management problems that, in the short term, makes it difficult to justify the current crop insurance program as the sole source of disaster assistance to farmers,'' said <PERSON> Harman </PERSON>. He said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should provide a transition period if it decides to rely exclusively on crop insurance for disaster assistance. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Classen </PERSON> testified before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on conservation, credit and rural development. `` The commission believes that many changes to effect immediate administrative improvements in the program can be made under existing law by the secretary of agriculture and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Classen </PERSON>. `` These changes would foster increased participation by farmers.''

 American ethnic groups view the U.S.-Soviet meeting that starts today as a means of seizing on Kremlin reforms to lobby for such causes as Baltic independence, Jewish emigration, easy travel for Eskimos and Armenian rights. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> are to sign an agreement Saturday to shatter the so-called `` Ice Curtain'' that has divided the Yupik and Inupiat Eskimos of <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> since the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> forbade travel across the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> in 1948, administration and congressional sources said. `` The Arctic winds that pass through are becoming warmer, beckoning others to join in chipping away at the ice curtain,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, hailing the promised agreement. The well-being of other ethnic groups in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is far less certain. Jewish, Armenian and Baltic organizations were pressuring the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to use the <LOCATION> Baker-Shevardnadze </LOCATION> session to discuss many of the same issues dealt with at a stormy <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> meeting that ended Wednesday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution urging Soviet nationalities, including the Lithuanians, Estonians and Latvians of the Baltic republics, and the Armenian majority of the troubled <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> enclave, to curb their demands for political independence in return for greater economic autonomy. Six senators led by Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, have introduced a measure urging <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to transfer authority over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, from which it is separated by a narrow band of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Armenian-American groups took out newspaper advertisements this week urging <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to raise the issue with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> when they meet in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, this Friday through Sunday. Baltic-American groups were planning similar steps. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> never has recognized the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> annexation of the Baltic republics at the close of World War II, and on Tuesday Baker advanced that policy a step further by urging independence for those people. `` It's been the position of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for some time that we do not recognize the incorporation of the Baltic states into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` We do not seek to foster, nor would we profit from, instability in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. So we'd like to see a peaceful move toward independence for the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> states.'' Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> signaled a more outspoken White House stance on the Baltic in a <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> interview on Sept. 9. `` Clearly, every event triggers a response. And if there's a negative event toward the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> states, I would imagine there would be a negative response,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. Neither he nor other administration officials have specified what steps they would take if the Kremlin cracks down. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakas </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based emigre group, said, `` I see this as a step. I think that circumstances have forced the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to take a stand.'' A bipartisan group of 24 senators, headed by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., sent a public letter to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> on Wednesday saying that `` the vice president's recent statements to the press in support of the Baltic peoples' struggle for independence must be reemphasized in face-to-face meetings with Soviet officials'' The administration also came under some pressure, and some applause, this week from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Soviet Jewry, which pointedly met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday, two days before <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s arrival. `` It looks as if most Jews who want to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may now leave,'' Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> told the conference. `` That does not mean we are dropping the refusenik cases that are still unresolved. We will continue to work on them until every single case in which an emigrant permit is unjustly denied has been satisfactorily resolved,'' he said, stressing that the issue would be raised at the meeting this week. The Jewish group, in response, endorsed a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration plan to shift to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> the job of screening of Soviets seeking to emigrate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The change is needed to cope with the rapid rise in emigration, which promises to top the record level set in 1979.

<TEXT>
 Legislation advancing in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would give more veterans the opportunity to choose <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> as their final resting place. The national military cemetery, on a hillside directly across the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, is expected to run out of casket space in 2020. The columbarium, where urns are stored, is expected to be full in 2029. But a bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday would allow veterans who qualify for burial at <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> to choose an unmarked burial for their ashes. Although the legislation does n't specify the site, one proposal would have ashes buried in one area with the names of all the deceased carved on a large memorial stone. The problem of dwindling space at <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> has been growing as the average age of the veterans population has grown older. The number of veterans over 65 years old total nearly 6 million now and should be nearly 9 million by the turn of the century. Until restrictions were enacted in 1967, any honorably discharged veteran could be buried at <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>. Roughly 190,000 people are buried in the 612-acre cemetery. The disposal of ashes in a common area would be strictly optional and would not use any space that could be used for caskets, the bill says. The ashes, which would not be placed in urns, would be buried under sod or in small hole. An aide to Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., the bill's chief sponsor, said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> would insist on a fitting ceremony and interment to address concerns `` that it may seem like a mass grave. In another action, the committee approved legislation to create a World War II memorial in or near the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, paid for by donations and taxes. No decisions have been made on size, location and design of the memorial.

 Cuts <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering in the fiscal 1990 budget for various weapons programs could derail a U.S.-Soviet agreement on reducing strategic arms, says President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominee to be chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, whose career has spanned two combat tours in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to a stint as former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser, won unanimous approval Wednesday from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to be the nation's top military commander. If confirmed by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> would succeed Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who is retiring Sept. 30. During the nearly three-hour confirmation hearing earlier Wednesday, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> told members of the committee that political changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should not lead to wholesale cuts in the Star Wars program, land-based nuclear missiles or the B-2 stealth bomber. House legislation would cut $ 502 million from the $ 1.1 billion request for the multiple-warhead, rail-based MX missile and eliminate all $ 100 million earmarked for the single-warhead, truck-mobile Midgetman. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan `` would completely unhinge our START -LRB- Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -RRB- negotiating position.'' House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees met behind closed doors Wednesday to craft a final version of the defense bill. According to congressional sources who requested anonymity, senators rejected a revised <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> proposal calling for full funding of the MX missile and elimination of the Midgetman. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>'s remarks came one day after Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> announced the administration will no longer insist on elimination of land-based mobile missiles, conceding the issue had complicated negotiations. The Soviets have two mobile missiles while the administration is asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to fund the MX and Midgetman. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> also told senators that scaling back the program to build 130 of the bat-winged B-2 bombers, considered the most expensive plane in history at $ 530 million a copy, would force the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to change its stance in arms talks with the Soviets. `` Without the B-2, we no longer have the same START position that we did for the last several years and I believe it most unlikely that there will be a treaty up here to ratify,'' he said. `` We would have to go back quite a ways and renegotiate a different type of treaty,'' he said. On other issues, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said: _ He supported using the armed forces in the war on drugs and in response to terrorist attacks _ The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> should not unilaterally cut troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and other overseas posts to convince allies to share more of the defense burden <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said he was `` very hesitant'' to do it to satisfy current budget demands. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> is commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> MacPherson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. He was hailed by Democrat <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and Republican <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as likely the best appointment <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s swift elimination of a quarter of the ruling Politburo, including two leading conservatives, demonstrates his political strength just as doubts about his staying power were gaining currency in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The dramatic power play, executed on the eve of Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House, served to counter suggestions that the Soviet president had been weakened by increasing public frustration with worsening economic conditions and heightened ethnic tensions. The shake-up could be seen as strengthening <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s hand as he seeks to revitalize the arms control process during talks with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. With successive moves during the last year to consolidate his power, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may now have broken high-level resistance and opened the way for sweeping changes that reformers say are needed if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of economic restructuring is to shake the country out of the doldrums. The party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting that shuffled the makeup of the party's Politburo also handed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> an early opportunity next year to use a party congress to reach further down into the party apparatus to shake out bureaucrats blamed for smothering reform. The president and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief successfully instituted glasnost, which has brought more open criticism and debate. He overhauled the political system to encourage competitive elections and representative oversight of government operations. And his `` new thinking'' in foreign policy has done much to dispel what he called his country's `` enemy image'' abroad. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms so far have failed to relieve the grinding economic hardship that has left consumers frustrated by barren cupboards and empty store shelves at a time when their own media show them the practical pleasures of living in the comparatively wealthy West. Outspoken reformists in and out of the recently elected <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies have said the transition from the old system of central planning and control to a new market economy requires radical stripping away of bureaucratic control over supplies and prices. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> so far has talked about such steps without actually taking them. With the retirement of veteran Ukrainian party boss <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON>, 71, the 58-year-old <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is now the only member of the Politburo elevated to the ruling body during the regime of the late <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> has long been regarded as one of the most conservative forces in the leadership but too entrenched in his home republic for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to unseat him. Former <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON>, 66, another of those retired Wednesday, also was regarded as a conservative anchor who opposed many <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reforms. The departures left one prominent conservative, <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, in place. But both <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> have taken pains to express their support for each other while often disagreeing on policy. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> installed two of his own men, Gen. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON>, the new <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief, and <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON>, who heads economic planning, as full members of the Politburo, which now numbers 11 men. The retirements also included non-voting member <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Solovyev </PERSON>, who thus became the first member of the party's top leadership to fall after being defeated at the polls. <PERSON> Solovyev </PERSON>, who was rejected by the voters of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> when he ran unopposed for a seat in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, already had been removed as <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> party chief. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> opened the way for graceful retirement from the top echelons of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> power when he paid public tribute to <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> as he relieved him of the presidency a year ago. He continued that practice Wednesday. When it was announced that <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nikonov </PERSON> were going out on pension, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> thanked the three Politburo members warmly for their `` many years of fruitful activity'' in the party. Departures from the party leadership were once accomplished only by death or abrupt ouster into instant obscurity or public disgrace.

 <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, the wife of suspected spy <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, will no longer work as executive director of a foundation that promotes cultural exchanges between <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of publicity surrounding her husband's case. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, a lawyer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who serves as the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Austrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that Mrs. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> resigned because she found the controversy surrounding her husband hurt her effectiveness on the job. The board has decided to close its office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and move its headquarters from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The group is looking for a successor to Mrs. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, who resigned Tuesday. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, the former No. 2 official at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and a veteran of 30 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, has been under surveillance by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents since June. `` Just imagine the terrible pressure and the problem -LRB- Mrs. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> -RRB- is having,'' <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure every time she turns around, they say, ` Oh, you're that man's wife.''' <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing and no charges have been filed against him. A secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Austrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said Mrs. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> was not available for comment, and she did not immediately return a message left on her home answering machine. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said she has relatives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> she often stays with. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said the foundation, which received private contributions and about $ 39,000 from the Austrian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in 1988, will continue to operate programs such as one that promotes exchanges for young journalists. Meantime, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> refused Wednesday to discuss the status of the <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> case. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, 54, was placed on administrative leave with pay from his <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> job in June, a month before allegations against him were made public. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> was trailed for weeks by reporters and photographers as he went about his business, operating from his apartment. More recently he has disappeared from the media spotlight. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> launched its probe after <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> was photographed handing a briefcase to a suspected Soviet agent in a restaurant in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in May, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources who commented on condition they not be named.

 <PERSON> Jessye </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, who has probably the most lustrous female voice in opera today, was the guest artist at the opening of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION>'s season in <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. She sang gloriously both before and after intermission at the concert Wednesday night, televised by <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> as `` Live from Lincoln Center.'' The evening began with music director <PERSON> Zubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON>'s remarkable conducting of <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s overture to `` Tannhauser.'' It had the pure, sweet religious faith which is one of the major themes of the opera, a feeling of cleansing its listeners. Finally, the music swelled into an electrifying ending. <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON> certainly has a feel for opera. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Philharmonic sounded like one of the great orchestras. Miss <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> followed, singing <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>'s five late songs to poems by <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruckert </PERSON>. She shaped each of those familiar songs differently but with no sense of stretching to be different. The first was poignant, the third sometimes mysterious, the third tender then swelling to become tones a listener could enter. In the final song, `` I Have Withdrawn from the World,'' Miss <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> used a dark, lush tone to convey something stark, then shaded it into calm. After intermission, she sang the `` Liebestod'' from <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s `` Tristan und Isolde. Even in that outpouring from a woman in a trance of love, Miss <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> had nuances. She started softly, then rose to the power of <PERSON> Isolde </PERSON>'s larger-then-life vision. Though her vocal strength, with a larger-than-usual orchestra on stage, was remarkable, she lost no tonal beauty. The orchestra played the prelude to `` Tristan,'' leading up to the `` Liebestod.'' The other piece on the program was <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s `` 40th Symphony.'' <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON> may have been slightly less inspired by that than by the operatic pieces. Balances in the second movement did n't sound just right. But it is a rather hyper symphony and <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON> and the Philharmonic did capture that. It was suggested ahead of time to audience members that women's gowns be white, black or a combination of white and black and most women complied Miss <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s gown, in contrast, was bright patterns which looked inspired by <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. A covered walkway and tent for a late dinner kept the heavy rain off concertgoers. Bouquets in tall, slender silver vases on each table were of white flowers.

<HEAD>Democrats, Republicans, Educators Vie for Piece of Summit Action</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> guaranteed a prominent role in next week's education summit, Democrats and Republicans _ and to a lesser extent educators _ already are jockeying for a piece of the action. However, money is one key subject absent from most of the lofty proposals and the flurry of activities before the two-day meeting with the nation's governors. Democratic leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stole the scene Wednesday by announcing six national performance goals to upgrade American education, including lower dropout rates, higher college-going rates and early childhood education for all poor 4-year-olds by 1995 or earlier. The Democrats, joined by <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> state and local politicians, assembled at a showcase school in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb about 2 -LCB- hours before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended a private seminar with some of the nation's best-known educators who offered advice for the summit in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. Thirty minutes before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s seminar, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest teachers' union, released its own `` Classroom Agenda for the Education Summit. NEA President <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> broached the politically volatile issue of money and noted that for every $ 3 state and local governments added to education in the 1980s, the federal government took $ 1 away. He said the federal share of the school dollar for elementary and secondary schools declined from 9.2 percent in 1981 to 6.3 percent in 1989. <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> said money should be a key focus of the summit and added, `` The federal government must become a more active partner in promoting progress.'' <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, on hand to congratulate the Democrats for their proposals, conceded `` there will be a lot of discussions about federal funding'' at the summit. `` But I think the important thing is to note that the governors, at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, committed to this process of goal-setting because we know, first of all there's a big deficit; secondly, the president made a commitment not to raise any money; thirdly, most of the money being raised now ... is at the state and local level,'' <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said. `` I think the most important thing is to decide where the country needs to go in education and then once you do that you can develop a strategy to achieve those goals that assesses responsibility,'' <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said, who is co-leading summit preparations for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The Democrats also seek to raise students' basic skills achievement levels, boost their performance in math, science and foreign languages, and expand the pool of qualified teachers. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> called the list `` Democratic education goals for the nation,'' and said his party `` has long championed educational opportunity for all Americans. The major federal education programs were Democratic initiatives.'' While the Democrats gathered at <ORGANIZATION> Eleanor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greenbelt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sat down for private talks at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with a dozen education leaders, assuring them that the deck was not `` stacked'' for the summit and that he was eager to hear their ideas. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Comer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> child psychiatrist and expert on educating poor children, said afterward that he entered the White House skeptical, but emerged `` relieved and impressed that -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- does understand the complexity'' of the problems facing the schools. Comer cautioned against putting `` more pressures on educators without creating ... the circumstances that can support them and make it possible for people to reach those goals.'' But <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, said, `` We need clear goals and ... brand-new school systems.'' While the Democrats put no price tag on how much it would cost to meet their education goals, the list clearly would entail major increases in the $ 22 billion Education Department budget. Their policy statement promised that the Democrats `` will continue to seek adequate funding for the major federal education initiatives,'' especially efforts to improve opportunities for the poor and handicapped, and aid for schools and college students.

 A proposal to expand the rights of the disabled could put such a financial strain on city transit services that it ends up harming the general public and the handicapped alike, congressional critics of the legislation say. Republicans on a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee questioned Wednesday whether wheelchair lifts should be required on all public transit buses, pointing to one major city where existing lifts are used only every other day on average. A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration official told the surface transportation subcommittee the provision is a key part of the Americans With Disabilities Act, which has come to be known as civil rights legislation for the handicapped. The universal use of the lifts, and a requirement for door-to-door bus service for those who ca n't make it to a bus stop, would help get the nation's 43 million disabled people into the mainstream of daily <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> life, said <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mross </PERSON>, deputy administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Republicans on the panel, however, are questioning the blanket nature of the requirements. `` I'm also concerned that if we increase costs to the point that we bring a reduction of service then we are not serving the disabled and we're not serving the general public either,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON>, R-Pa. Each lift adds about $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 to the $ 155,000 cost of a bus and adds $ 2,000 to the annual maintenance cost, <PERSON> Mross </PERSON> told the panel He estimated the annual cost just of buying lifts at $ 30 million. <ORGANIZATION> UMTA </ORGANIZATION> would probably pay $ 24 million of that, he said. Although there are already regulations governing access by the elderly and handicapped to mass transit receiving federal funds, the new act would be far stricter. At issue in Wednesday's hearing was a requirement in the bill, already passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and endorsed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, that all public transit buses be equipped with wheelchair lifts. <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures show that in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, which has lift-equipped buses, each lift is used every other day. Spokesman for the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Cambria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, systems _ which are considered leaders in serving the handicapped _ told the panel the bill would cause hardships. But <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>, legislative analyst at the President's <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> with </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disabilities </ORGANIZATION>, said the existing service keeps the handicapped virtually confined to their homes. She said many systems that have door-to-door service for the disabled require long advance notice _ 16 or 17 hours on the average _ and require a large amount of red tape to qualify for the service. `` You ca n't decide on a moment's notice that you want to go shopping or stay at the office late,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed a version of the bill, with the transit requirements, on Sept. 7.

<HEAD>Sexually Active College Students Not Using Condoms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A survey of 6,911 white, middle-class college students found that they knew how to protect themselves against AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases but were n't doing it. About 75 percent of the Canadian students reported that they were sexually active but only 19 percent said they used condoms regularly. Twenty-six percent said they never used condoms. Yet 80 percent answered correctly when asked questions about preventing sexually transmitted diseases. The survey `` suggests most education and media campaigns to increase condom use are dismal failures,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Noni </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ottawa </ORGANIZATION>. She presented her findings Wednesday at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microbiology </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, a member of a Canadian health ministry task force on sexually transmitted diseases, said her findings probably would apply to white, middle-class <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> college students. `` If we've got it in ` middle-America <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,' you must have it in middle <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' she said. The study found that 30 percent of 14-year-olds already had had intercourse. So had 77 percent of college men and 73 percent of college women. One in four men and one in eight women reported having had at least 10 sexual partners. These findings held true `` right across the country, coast-to-coast, little town, big town,'' said <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>. A recent study of condom use by adolescent males in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> found that 57 percent reported use of a condom the last time they had intercourse, but that only 30 percent said they had always used a condom. The author of the American study, <PERSON> Freya </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonenstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said condom use has increased, but that condom use is lowest in the adolescents who are most at risk, either because they have multiple partners or have sex with prostitutes, for example. Condoms have been widely promoted as a way to cut the risk of getting infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, that causes AIDS. But they also can protect against other sexually transmitted diseases, such as chlamydia, a common infection that can leave women infertile, sometimes without causing any symptoms at the time of infection. Eight percent of the Canadian college students have had at least one sexually transmitted disease, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sonenstein </PERSON> found that reports of condom use among American adolescent males doubled during the past 10 years or so. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said condom sales jumped by 20 percent shortly after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> surgeon general released his report on AIDS in 1986. Even so, syphilis is on the rise in inner cities. `` It appears obvious to me that there are a lot of people not using condoms that should,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` Clearly there is a large group of people putting themselves at risk for HIV by not using condoms.'' AIDS is uncommon among Canadian college students now, but `` with the rapidity with which they're having sexual intercourse, it would not take long to spread,'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> said. She said that students must be taught not only the facts about AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases but also how to handle awkward social and sexual situations so that condom use becomes easier. `` When you teach someone how to drive a car, you do n't tell them about the engine, you teach them how to do it,'' she said.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s journey to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for superpower negotiations comes at a time the Soviets are dealing with complex internal difficulties and talking as if the thrill is gone from relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` That the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is not consumed by the enthusiastic wish to reach agreements with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is recognized even here as an indisputable fact,'' Pravda wrote from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, as <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> flew to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> last met in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in July, and for the Soviets, arms control remains the acid test of their relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Successful development of U.S.-Soviet relations can hardly be imagined without progress in the area of arms limitation and reduction,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency recently informed readers. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will meet over the weekend in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. The Kremlin's outward mood has shifted from elation to dismay as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has presided over a slowdown in the pace of arms control talks, an area which gave <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> his first tangible policy achievement with the signing of a treaty with former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to eliminate medium - and shorter-range nuclear missiles For Soviets, whose dreary, shortage-plagued lot has failed to improve and in many cases worsened under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reforms, the 1987 treaty and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> seemed to presage a new and safer world, with a good share of credit going to their own leader. But with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Soviets are dealing with a president who said this week he's in no hurry for a summit meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. This time the Soviets have dropped heavy hints that <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> will unveil a new offer in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where he pays a call on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today, or later in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. Exactly what <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> is carrying remains under wraps, but <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted him upon departure from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as saying he has a personal message from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on disarmament. `` It's a deep and constructive document'' designed to spur the talks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said without giving details. Superpower negotiations aside, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s activities before he boarded a special Washington-bound jetliner give a glimpse of how daunting the problems facing his country are. According to <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, his spokesman, the snowy-haired member of the ruling Politburo attended a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> meeting charged with finding a way out of the spasms of violence between <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ethnic groups in which 200 people have died in the last 19 months. In addition, entrenched portions of the Soviet bureaucracy, fearful of losing position and privilege, have resisted movement toward a more market-oriented economy with its attendant risks. Official press accounts assert the superpowers are within reach of an accord to boost a worldwide ban on chemical weapons, and <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> on Wednesday welcomed <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s statement that the Americans may withdraw their proposal for a ban on mobile ICBMs, one sticking point in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks on long-range weapons. Yet the Soviets have expressed dissatisfaction with the pace of arms control talks under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. Usually smiling and debonair, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> earlier this month denounced the `` constraint and timidity'' of the officials in charge of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s new arms reduction policy. It was another signal of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s frustration at the latest turn taken by U.S.-Soviet relations. Putting superpower talks for a 50 percent reduction of strategic weapons on a faster track is a major concern of the Soviets, and they've all but openly accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> of neglecting the parleys. `` The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> negotiations and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation's stance there call for a powerful political impetus,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Only the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president and the secretary of state are able to provide it.'' `` When creating the atmosphere around the forthcoming political contacts, the Soviet side would like to concentrate primarily on recent positive statements by President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Among those statements is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s professed support for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s domestic reform agenda, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Whatever the course of the talks, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> should feel right at home in the mountain air of <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>. His native <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> in the Soviet south lies in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> range, and its tallest peak, <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elbrus </ORGANIZATION>, tops Grand Teton by almost a mile.

The shake-up came at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that centered on solving ethnic strife that has killed more than 200 people in the multi-national <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the past 19 months. It followed committee approval of a program advocating for more self-rule in restive Soviet republics but demanding that calls for secession from the union be stifled. The removal of Shcherbitsky and <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> _ two men with histories of cracking down on dissent _ was likely to mitigate the sting of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s harsh criticism of secessionists for independence activists in some republics. The shake-up gives <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a stronger hand in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as the party leadership writes a new program for the 1990s. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday moved up the date for the party's next congress to October 1990, handing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> an early opportunity to bring new blood into the party's top echelon. Only a party congress can add reformers to the 251-member Central Committee. The last one was held in 1986, just a year after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power. <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> was the last Politburo member other than <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> still serving from the time of President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. His retirement makes <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorotnikov </PERSON> of the Russian republic the only pre-Gorbachev appointee remaining on the Politburo. <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> presumably will remain party chief in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> until a replacement can be named. <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> had moved from head of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> a year ago to a new party position overseeing legal affairs. He is said to be one of those responsible for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s selection as party chief in 1985 but some Western analysts regarded him as a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rival. His departure was likely to please activists in some Soviet republics, especially in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, where he was suspected of having prior knowledge of a military assault that killed a score of nationalist demonstrators in April. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nikonov </PERSON>, an agricultural bureaucrat, also retired from full membership. He had described himself earlier this year as a deputy to <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> on party agricultural policy. His role on the Politburo was never clear, however, and his views on major policy questions were not well known. The new full members of the Politburo, <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON>, are no strangers to the Soviets. <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> has promoted his agency as a friend rather than foe of the people. He has undergone an unprecedented legislative confirmation hearing, granted interviews to the press and offered to cooperate with the West to combat terrorism and drug trafficking. <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, faces the task of reducing decades of central planning and sorting out economic relations with the republics. Two non-voting members of the Politburo, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Solovyev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Talyzin </PERSON>, also were forced out. Their places were taken by legislative leader <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugo </PERSON>, head of the party commission overseeing discipline. <PERSON> Solovyev </PERSON>, the former party chief of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, was humiliated in March when he was rejected in an election for the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies even though he ran unopposed. He subsequently was removed as party chief. <PERSON> Talyzin </PERSON> was <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON>'s predecessor as planning chief, but was demoted twice before being dropped from the Politburo. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in his closing speech Wednesday it was time to `` strike a determined blow at those who offer us adventurist platforms instead of politics and serious affairs.'' Speaking extemporaneously and jabbing his finger in the air for emphasis, he said the country could not afford to be `` dragged into any reshaping of borders ... changing shapes of national formations.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s program declared that republics have the right to own and manage their land and natural resources free from central planners in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and should `` enjoy broad opportunities to invigorate their economy and culture'' while relying on the overall strength of the national economy.

 Panicked residents and tourists who scrambled to the first evacuation plane out of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> told tales of horror after arriving back on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland. Hurricane Hugo's devastation of the popular Caribbean tourist retreat was followed by a swarm of gun-wielding looters, prompting President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to dispatch military police and arrange for evacuations. `` We just got lucky,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, about being among 145 passengers on a special <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> evacuation flight arranged by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals Wednesday night.

 Many residents of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Simons </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> never lived through a major hurricane, but they're not ignoring the furor of Hurricane Hugo as it headed toward the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. `` I think anybody is going to be worried. It's a major catastrophic happening,'' said <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullens </PERSON>, a director of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. At an island grocery store, shoppers packed carts with bottled water, canned goods and other supplies. `` Compared to past storms, they're taking it more seriously,'' supermarket manager <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` A lot more people seem to be talking about leaving.'' Attracted by its beaches, golf courses, warm climate and Southern charm, about 5,000 people have moved to the island 65 miles south of <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> since the last hurricane came ashore in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> in 1979. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simons </PERSON> is about 10 miles long and is connected to the mainland city of <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> by a seven-mile causeway. Parts of the island remain undeveloped but elsewhere, beachfront condos and subdivisions have sprouted up amid palms, pines and moss-draped oaks. Disaster officials called for the voluntary evacuation of the island's 14,000 residents late Wednesday. They were ready to order the evacuation of 30,000 residents from St. <PERSON> Simons </PERSON> and lowlying areas of <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> and surrounding <LOCATION> Glynn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` We would have to assess the situation, look at the tides, the storm surge and the advice of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelle </PERSON>, the county's community development director. The weather service issued a hurricane watch Wednesday evening and said there was an 11 percent chance <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> could come within 65 miles of <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> between 8 p.m. today and 8 a.m. Friday. When Hurricane <PERSON> David </PERSON> came ashore near <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> on Sept. 4, 1979, the storm knocked down trees, power lines and flooded streets before moving into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> left 1,200 people dead _ 19 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> has claimed 25 lives on <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands. Since its last hurricane, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simons </PERSON>' population jumped from 9,000. `` The major problem is the education of people,'' said <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>. `` We've got a lot of new people who probably are n't familiar with coastal problems associated with a hurricane. They're now aware of the warnings and what the warnings mean.'' The problem is common in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s eight coastal counties. The area is the state's fastest growing region, with the population surging from 350,000 in 1980 to an estimated 400,000 in 1988. Growth has been spurred by a new submarine base in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> division at <LOCATION> Hinesville </LOCATION>, an $ 800-million-a-year tourist industry and an influx of industries. But <ORGANIZATION> Cullens </ORGANIZATION> said the growth has left the island better equipped to withstand hurricanes. `` We have a better causeway and a better road system,'' he said. Since Hurricane <PERSON> David </PERSON>, a two-lane causeway with lift bridges has been replaced by a four-lane causeway with high bridges. The island also has strengthened building codes, he said. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who runs a mail-order business on <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simons </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> would be her first hurricane. `` I think I'm more concerned about our business than our house on the beach,'' she said. `` We'd take our dogs and cats, and we'd be gone.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, the staff has met often with the elderly residents to prepare them for a possible evacuation. `` Many of our residents have pets and valuables,'' general manager <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON> said. `` It's hard to explain to them that this is a temporary evacuation.''

 The dollar remained sharply lower against the Japanese yen Thursday, while the key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> rose.

The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shot up 274.44 points, or 0.80 percent, ending the day at 34,745.02. It had lost 0.49 points the previous day.

 Hurricane Hugo quickened its pace toward the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seaboard </LOCATION> on Wednesday as residents gathered supplies and made evacuation plans, while violence and looting broke out on the shattered islands in the storm's wake. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered Army troops to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> and police reportedly joined prison escapees and others in wild looting. Armed <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> crewmen also went ashore to help restore order. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> ordered 100 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents to the island, and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutters evacuated frightened tourists and residents. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also authorized troops to help hurricane-damaged <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Forecasters issued a hurricane watch from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Augustine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, urging coastal residents to begin taking precautions. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> picked up speed over open water and could come ashore late Thursday or early Friday. `` I think they're looking at this one with a bit of respect,'' city spokesman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, as radio and TV advisories warned: `` Remember the people of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>.'' Since Sunday, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> has killed at least 25 people, left thousands homeless and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage as it slashed through the northeastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> with wind of 125 to 150 mph. Chaos reigned on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, as police and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> joined machete-armed mobs on a post-Hugo looting spree. Gunshots were fired, and ham radio operators heard reports that inmates had either escaped or been released because of prison damage and were looting. Tourists pleaded with reporters landing on the island to take them off. `` They said, ` Please get food! Please get water! Please help us! They're looting. We've seen police looting. We've seen National Guard looting. There's no law and order here,''' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a reporter for the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dia </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> had six ships in the area and sent armed crewmen from the cutter Bear ashore to help restore order. `` Our shore party went ashore and basically determined there was a complete breakdown of authority. There's a very high indication that innocent people are going to get hurt in an act of violence there,'' Lt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The crew was evacuating `` all people from the island who fear for their safety,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. A cargo plane was ready to supplement the evacuation if needed. Tourists sat on the porch of the <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, protected by hotel employees carrying shotguns. `` It was horrendous,'' said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertzog </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, who waited out the storm in a hotel laundry room. `` I thought we were going to die. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> ordered the 100 marshals and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents to protect federal officials and property, as well as help bolster local law enforcement, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. A small team of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents was sent in first to set up a command post. The White House said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON>, governor of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to authorize use of troops to restore order on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> on Wednesday night denied making that request. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday declared the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> a disaster area and a White House spokesman said a similar declaration was expected soon for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, which suffered widespread damage. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> sent cutters to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> to pick up personnel and their families whose homes were destroyed. It also was evacuating 200 American medical students at <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION>, a British colony where <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> damaged nearly 90 percent of the homes. Federal relief shipments laden with supplies and rescue workers from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guantanamo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, went to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, while British and French forces helped <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>. At 3 a.m. EDT Thursday, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s center was about 450 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, at 28.2 degrees north latitude and 75.2 degrees west longitude, and was moving northwest at 17 mph, up from 12 mph earlier in the day. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s wind speed also rose from 105 to 110 mph Wednesday, but forecasters said little further strengthening was likely. Forecasters said <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s path made residents from <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, most likely to be in harm's way, but they were delaying issuing hurricane warnings until they could make better projections. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said officials did n't want to spur `` a cry-wolf syndrome'' by triggering premature evacuation of the resort and retiree communities. But forecasters said they hoped <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents learned from <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> rampage `` When those islands got pounded like they did, that's remarkable,'' forecaster <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said of the relatively low death toll `` We gave them a lot of warning, and they apparently took the warnings.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coastal residents have enough time to prepare, he said. `` Let's hope they are,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. `` If later on, they say ` Boy, you sure got that wrong,' that's OK. We'd rather that happen than have people wake up at 2 a.m. and find a hurricane coming. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campell </PERSON> put state law enforcement agencies on alert. ` All we can do is to watch now and to wait,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, the historic <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> was boarded up and school children were told to stay home Thursday. Officials said coastal residents seemed to be taking the right steps, such as storing emergency supplies and buying materials for boarding up. `` They're buying me out of all my candles, tape, flashlights, propane fuel, oil and lamps,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brindley </PERSON>, merchandise manager of K mart in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> `` I see a lot of people buying water and canned goods like pork and beans. It's been pretty steady,'' said <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Raleigh </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lion </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, where nearby <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> suffered $ 90 million in damages when hit by Hurricane <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> in 1984. Some took extra precautions. `` We're going to church a lot,'' said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, town manager in <LOCATION> Bethany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, Del. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sent its Charleston-based ships to sea to avoid <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, while crews were called Wednesday to their ships at <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> for a possible move out. `` Like the Boy Scouts, we're prepared,'' said Chief Petty Officer Art <PERSON> Riccio </PERSON>. Adminstrators at the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for the Deaf and <PERSON> Blind </PERSON> sent home 400 children living in dormitories. `` The decision was to assume the worst and plan accordingly,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>, a school spokeswoman. Bahamians, meanwhile, watched as the hurricane moved away with little impact. `` It's a great sigh of relief for all of us in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>,'' said meteorologist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stubbs </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION>. `` Most people want to be able to enjoy the sea and sunshine here, and now they can.'' Meanwhile, forecasters said <ORGANIZATION> Tropical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iris </ORGANIZATION> was being weakened because of its proximity to <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, but could cause more problems for the Hugo-hit islands. `` Satellite pictures show an area of thunderstorms extends south of the center into the extreme northeastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>,'' forecaster <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` Unfortunately, this activity will be moving westward over an area that was struck by Hurricane Hugo just three days ago.'' At 10:30 p.m., <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> was near latitude 22.0 north and longitude 64.0 west, or 250 miles north-northeast of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Its winds were down to 45 mph as the storm moved west-northwest at around 12 mph.

<HEAD>Mercedes Pulls Disappearing Act on EPA Guzzlers List</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s massive annual guide to automobile gas mileage is supposed to tell motorists at a glance what cars are the stingiest and the worst guzzlers of fuel. But not always, it turns out. Dozens of cars each year are missing from the annual list, and this year the absent included the entire line of luxury cars from <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, including 11 whose mileage is so poor the cars are subject to the special `` guzzler'' excise tax. Three of the Mercedes cars likely would have made the `` ten worst'' list had they been included in the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> survey of 981 cars that was released earlier this week and widely distributed by the news media. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, branch manager at the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s auto testing laboratory in <LOCATION> Ann </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, said every year perhaps 80 or 90 cars do not make the list because manufacturers do not provide the testing data to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> when the mileage guide goes to the printer. Aside from Mercedes, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> could not say what specific cars were missing. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> still must submit test data for three cars and industry sources said they would not be surprised if a dozen or more other manufacturers had yet to submit test information on a few cars each. `` There are always a few stragglers,'' said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>. Federal law requires automakers to submit the mileage test data and have it certified by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> before a car is placed on the market. But they are not required to submit the information by a specific date or meet the deadline for the initial industry-wide mileage guide. Government and industry sources, speaking anonymously, acknowledged the mileage guide can both help and hinder automakers. Manufacturers often test their high mileage cars early to meet the deadline for the publication and move more slowly on their high-mileage models, said one official. The submission of the test data `` is at the manufacturer's control I do n't know what was in the minds of Mercedes in making their decision -LRB- not to submit test results earlier -RRB-. But they do have relatively fuel inefficient vehicles,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>. The deadline for test data this year was Aug. 30. At the request of one automaker, it was postponed until Sept. 5. <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> submitted its first 1990 model test data covering a dozen cars on Sept. 9, said <PERSON> Eldert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bontekoe </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s certification office in <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>. A.B. <PERSON> Shuman </PERSON>, manager of public relations at <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Montvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview the mileage performance of the cars was `` absolutely not a factor'' in the data being submitted late. `` It was just getting it all done,'' said <PERSON> Shuman </PERSON>, who said the company had been unable to complete all the testing in time. <PERSON> Shuman </PERSON> also noted Mercedes does not put its 1990 models on the market until Nov. 1 and so has more time to submit the test data than many other automakers whose 1990 models hit the showroom in September and October. Nevertheless, 11 of the Mercedes cars showed overall mileage of 18 miles per gallon or less and are subject to a `` gas guzzler'' excise tax, according to figures provided by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. At least three of the 1990 Mercedes models had mileage so low they likely would have been among the `` worst ten'' in mileage for 1990 had they been included in the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> survey list. The mileage data for the Mercedes cars _ along with figures for any other cars submitted late _ will be included in an updated mileage list in February. But Ms. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, acknowledged the revised list usually gets little public attention.

<HEAD>FDA Investigating Reports of Side Effects Related to Drug Halcion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is looking into a `` relatively high'' number of reports about unwanted side effects from the drug Halcion, the world's most widely prescribed sleep medication. An <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> advisory committee is expected to review the reports at a meeting Friday to determine why more adverse reactions have been reported for Halcion than for other drugs in its class of hypnotics. Halcion has been on the market since the beginning of 1983 and is <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s second-largest sales item. Spokeswomen for the company and the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said they did not know the nature of the reports about adverse reactions or the number of reports received. However, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said that at the time the drug was approved the agency was aware of a variety of adverse effects reported in association with use of Halcion, including confusion, agitation, hallucinations, amnesia and bizarre behavior. All except bizarre behavior were included in label warnings, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said the company will review epidemiological data at the meeting that `` indicate that side effects with Halcion are not different in number or kind when compared with other medications in its class.'' She said the higher number of reports of problems associated with the drug stem in part from `` sensational allegations in the media about Halcion,'' including a case in which a <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> woman who was using the drug was accused of killing her mother. Murder charges against the woman were dismissed. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said it was never established that Halcion caused the woman to act as she did and contends the woman was taking a number of medications at the time. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, in seeking the advice of its <ORGANIZATION> Psychopharmacologic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drugs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, did not say how many reports of adverse effects have been received for Halcion, but said the number is higher than for other hypnotic drug products. The agency asked the panel to determine `` the meaning of this relatively high reporting rate and how this finding might be meaningfully communicated to the medical and lay public.'' Analysts quoted in Wednesday editions of The Wall Street Journal said Halcion sales have been declining apparently because of reports of adverse reactions to the drug. The newspaper quoted analysts as estimating that <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide sales of Halcion were expected to fall from about $ 260 million in 1988 to about $ 235 million this year.

 A <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> 737 carrying 61 people skidded off a runway at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and splashed into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> late Wednesday, killing at least two people, after the pilot tried to abort the takeoff, authorities said. `` The pilot seemed to be accelerating but did n't have enough power to get the plane up,'' said survivor <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, who huddled in blankets with his wife, <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON>. `` Something happened and he put on the brakes. The plane took a dip and the next thing I knew all hell broke loose,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` People were on top of each other. People were screaming. There was the smell of gas. Everyone was saying ` Get out! Get out! Get out!''' Witnesses said the aircraft split into two pieces, with part of the jetliner suspended out of the water. Some survivors crawled onto the wing to await their rescue, and some ended up in the water. `` They were hanging from the pier, hanging on the wing, hanging from the front of the plane,'' said police Lt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>. Sgt. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, a police diver at the crash site, said he removed two bodies from the plane and heard of a third fatality. But 51 people escaped from the plane unhurt, said Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who was on the scene. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, said he knew of only two deaths in the crash. Two people were taken to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in critical condition, said <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON>. A third person was in stable condition at another hospital after suffering a heart attack. The pilot tried to abort the takeoff for an unknown reason, said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The pilot aborted the takeoff at 11:29 p.m. and the plane skidded off runway into 25 to 40 feet of water in <LOCATION> Bowery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, about 50 to 100 feet from the end of the runway built on pilings in the water, officials said. `` The first third of the airplane is resting on the approach lights,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON>. `` The rest of the plane is in the river.'' Some people were trapped in the plane's tail section and were removed, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> said the plane skidded off the runway during takeoff and landed in the water, about 2,000 feet from the end of the runway, at 11:35 p.m. EDT. Fire officials said survivors were being taken to the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Shuttle terminal at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION>. Coast Guard small boats and planes were on the scene, as well as scores of police and emergency vehicles. A <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, said Flight 5050, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400, was bound for <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>. She said the plane carried 55 passengers and a crew of six `` The evacuation of the aircraft was completed at 12:30 a.m. by raft,'' she said. The airplane was scheduled to leave for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> at 7:27 p.m. EDT, but was delayed three hours by heavy rain, as were all flights into and out of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area. The plane's engines were apparently cut off halfway down the runway and went into reverse thrust, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON>, a CBS News producer, who was on the plane. `` At that time no one thought there was going to be real trouble,'' <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> via cellular telephone. <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON> said he was sitting near the front of the plane, which split into two or three pieces. `` I was able to get up and start going toward the back,'' he said. `` A lot of women and children were screaming that they could n't swim, they could n't swim.'' Rescuers and crew members were trying to keep people calm, he said. `` Most people were pretty calm after we got out onto the wing of the plane,'' he said. `` And they waited for boats to come pick us up and the rescuers also arrived and I have to say they did a pretty good job of keeping everybody calm and getting them safely off.''

<HEAD>Automatic Cuts Looming as Congress Snarled in Partisan Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Partisan warfare over cutting the capital gains tax is part of a budget quagmire that has <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> so steeped in dispute that the government is threatened with automatic spending cuts next month. Republicans are taking pains in advance to set up the majority Democrats for the blame. At the heart of the political battle is the annual budget bill designed to reduce the deficit to within the parameters of the Gramm-Rudman budget law. Unless the bill is enacted, the estimated fiscal 1990 deficit will exceed the $ 110 billion maximum in Gramm-Rudman's guidelines, triggering cuts of nearly $ 17 billion will be ordered on Oct. 15. Half the cuts would come from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and half from civilian programs. But the budget bill is threatened with defeat in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> next week because most Democrats oppose its cut in the capital gains tax rate, which they call a giveaway to the rich. Republicans, who expect to win on the capital gains issue, may not vote for the bill either because they want the bill stripped of other provisions, including child care legislation and a revised catastrophic insurance plan for the elderly. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., predicted flatly that the automatic cuts `` will go into effect `` The question is how long will they stay in effect'' before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> can agree, he said. House Minority Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., agreed and said popular items such as farm subsidies and the space program would be slashed because Democrats were unable to manage the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' agenda <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said Democrats were killing the legislation because they loaded child care, Medicaid improvements, the Fairness Doctrine for broadcasters and a host of other issues on the must-pass legislation. `` The more they load this up, the more ... likely it will carry us into'' the automatic cuts, he said. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters prospects for averting the cuts were `` somewhat bleak,'' and it was up to the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to overcome the problems. With debate less than a week away, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders decided Wednesday it would fight <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s capital gains cut with a tax alternative of their own _ raising rates for society's wealthiest in order to give new tax breaks for individual retirement accounts. The plan is similar to one offered earlier this month by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, including a provision which would allow <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> savings to be used without penalty for education or first-time home purchases. Most House Democrats adamantly oppose the amendment approved in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> which would cut the maximum capital gains tax rate from 33 percent to 19.6 percent. Much of their anger is directed at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who Democrats believe has pushed his tax-cut campaign promise ahead of his commitment to work together to reduce the deficit. `` This dispute on capital gains is undercutting the kind of cooperation'' needed to tackle the deficit, said <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>. The capital gains dispute was also exposing rifts within Democratic ranks. Not only were some conservatives siding with the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> on capital gains, but liberals were pushing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> for an all-out brawl instead of a compromise. `` The troops that want to get on their horses and charge are growing impatient,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>. `` This capital gains issue will test the legendary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> thoughtfulness,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Mont. `` And a lot of people are watching to see if he'll pass the test.'' Aside from the deficit-reduction legislation, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed all 13 of its annual appropriations bills before the August recess. But only one has been forwarded to the president's desk because action in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has been stalled over the drug controversy. Acknowledging the mess, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has tentatively scheduled a meeting next Tuesday to approve a 31-day interim spending bill which would prevent the government from shutting down Oct. 1.

 Presidential assailant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> is still collecting material on actress <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> and thinks mass murderer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> is a `` cool dude,'' according to the government. Government lawyers, opposing <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>'s request to talk with the news media, on Wednesday produced letters he wrote last year thanking a man for sending him a semi-nude caricature of Miss Foster that <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> had requested. The letters were read into the court record after <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>, who wants to meet with reporters to prove he is sane, testified he had n't been `` obsessed, fixated -LRB- or -RRB- preoccupied'' with Miss Foster for five or six years. <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> has `` consistently told us he had no thoughts about <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>,'' testified psychiatrist Dr. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>. ` These writings tell us that is not true.'' <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> said after his arrest in the March 1981 assassination attempt on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that his action was an effort to attract Miss Foster. Psychiatrists treating <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> were unaware of the recent letters until they were turned over by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said. The Secret Service obtained the letters after <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> sent them. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge June Green is considering <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>'s request to conduct up to two interviews a month with the news media The hearing resumes Monday. `` Mr. <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>'s concern is on -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> TV's -RRB- ` Prime Time,' not on his mental health,'' testified <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> suffers from a narcissistic personality disorder, characterized as a severe mental illness. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said a symptom of <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>'s illness is an inability to draw distinctions between the famous and infamous. In his letter, read in court by <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> thanked the man for the caricature, then referred to <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>. `` I am not a follower, but he is one cool dude,'' <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>, leader of a cult whose members killed actress <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> and six others in 1969. Miss <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> was eight months pregnant when she was murdered. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> made references to <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> `` as recently as yesterday.'' The psychiatrist did not elaborate. At the hearing, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON>, a lawyer for the mental hospital where <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> is staying, asked <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> whether he told psychiatrists that he considered himself `` <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s successor.'' <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> replied he had not informed the psychiatrists. <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> did not pursue that line of questioning further. <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> was acquitted by reason of insanity in the shooting of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, White House press secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> police officer and a <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent.

<HEAD>Senate Readies Poland Aid Package</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is ready to dispatch beefed-up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s first non-communist government in four decades. In addition, the Democrats who control both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> are signaling their willingness to fight for an aid package far more potent than anything President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has so far proposed or than the $ 45 million initiative in the pending aid bill. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> readied the $ 14.4 billion appropriations measure for certain passage in a series of votes on amendments Wednesday. Final action was postponed pending agreement on an unrelated anti-drug package. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> included the bolstered aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in the bill after contending that $ 10 million in economic aid initially proposed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` totally inadequate'' to demonstrate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s surging economic and political reform movement. Democrats on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> raised the hackles of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members Wednesday as they contended the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aid proposal is `` pathetically timid.'' With all but one Republican member boycotting, and ignoring arguments that the money is not available, the committee voted 10 to 1 to authorize spending nearly $ 1.2 billion over three years in economic assistance for both <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The keystone of the Democratic initiative is the creation of economic development funds for both countries. The Polish fund would be authorized at $ 300 million for each of the three years; the fund for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> at $ 75 million a year. House Democrats also indicated their willingness on Wednesday to substantially increase aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` I believe we should give the administration everything it has asked for _ and then do more,'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` If we do not come to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s aid, how can we expect others to make the sacrifices necessary to obtain freedom and democracy? Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must find ways to rise above the nation's budget crunch and provide assistance to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> equal to the historic nature of their apparent transformation from communist rule `` Now is not the time for the niceties of bookkeeping; now is the time for imagination and innovation,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. `` Visionaries do not wear green eyeshades.'' Acting on amendments to the overall foreign aid bill, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted Wednesday to boost aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to $ 90 million after appeals to give the country's new president `` a chance to succeed.'' Voting 67-33, the legislators removed from the bill a provision that would have cut the aid into three installments to be made available at four-month intervals, with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> given virtual veto power over the last installment. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> then voted to peg <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> at $ 90 million, a $ 5 million boost. Opponents of the restrictions contended that they represented an unwarranted slap at the government of Salvadoran President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> at a time when there is a chance to end a ten-year civil war. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> was sworn in June 1 as the victorious candidate of the rightist <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> party. `` It will be a blow to him politically, at the very moment _ the very hour _ when we ought to be encouraging him to go forward,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., who joined a rare liberal-conservative alliance to oppose the restrictions Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., and other senators contended that the <ORGANIZATION> Arena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has been linked to death-squad activity in the past and has failed to totally stamp out human rights abuses The annual foreign aid spending bill pays for programs to bolster the military forces of friendly nations and to support economic development in poor countries.

<TEXT>
 Q: Can you tell us what you're bringing? Shevardnadze: Well, I am bringing a lot of paper. But they are interesting papers. Q: Are they surprises? Shevardnadze: I would not call them surprises, but we have serious proposals. I've brought a letter from <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I would like to say that we have come to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at a very important stage in the development of Soviet-U.S. relations, also at a time when major very important, fundamental changes are taking place in the Soviet society and when many things are changing in the East-West relationship. And we have to state that to a large extent those changes in the <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relationship result from the changes from the positive developments in Soviet-U.S. relations. But we believe that we should not stand still. We should not mark time. We should move forward. The experience that we have gained thus far permits us to hope that there will be further movement. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has mentioned the possibility of a new closeness between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and I would add that we have to move from a level of mutual understanding to a level of working together to a level of partnership wherever this is possible. So this is what we are bringing with us to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. My meeting with the president is tomorrow. We shall begin discussions with the secretary of state. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s letter contains some very important proposals, specifically, mostly on arms control and on reducing the military standoff between our two countries. And those proposals, I have no doubt, serve to remove most of the obstacles holding up progress and an agreement in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> at conventional arms discussions, also at the negotiations on a convention banning chemical weapons and nuclear testing talks and so on. And of course, we will be reporting to you more specifically during the talks and after them. Q: Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, are you going to tell the president that you wish the pace, the progress of U.S.-Soviet relations would quicken? Has he been too cautious? Shevardnadze: Well, I do believe that we have reason to say that the pace of the development of Soviet-American relations has to quicken. That would serve the interest of our two countries, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, and the interests of the world. Thank you.

 Virgin Islands Gov. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> says he did n't ask for the troops sent by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to his islands in the wake of looting related to Hurricane Hugo. Interviewed by <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> from his offices in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amalie </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> said his office had spoken to officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> about the possibility of requesting troops, `` and we got the impression that if we asked for help we would get it.'' But asked whether he had in fact sought federal help in restoring order, <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> said, `` We have not done so yet.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, informed of <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON>'s remarks, said, `` That's contrary to the information I have.'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would stand by its earlier statement, which said that <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> had requested the federal troops. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered two military police battalions and a headquarters unit totaling about 1,100 men to the islands to restore order. There have been unconfirmed reports that National Guard troops joined looters in the islands. Regarding reports of looting and rioting, the governor said: `` There is some looting, no doubt about that. But there is no near state of anarchy. And I should know. I'm in the streets every day and I'm the governor of this territory.''

<HEAD>Study Links Overnight Contact Wear with Dangerous Eye Ulcers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 People who sleep wearing contact lenses face 10-15 times the usual risk of potentially blinding eye ulcers, researchers warned today. But many eye doctors already discourage patients from routinely wearing their lenses to bed. `` You significantly increase the risk of complications when you wear any contact lens overnight, and the more nights you wear it in a row, the greater the risk,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. So-called extended-wear lenses are designed to be kept in the eye for several days at a time. When approved in 1980, they were recommended for use up to one month. But because of concern about complications, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> reduced the limit last May to one week. By then, however, many eye doctors already had grown suspicious of the safety of wearing lenses to bed, in part because they began seeing the usually rare eye ulcers in patients fitted with extended-wear lenses. `` My recommendation to patients is that if it is not terribly inconvenient for you, and you do n't mind doing it, I would prefer you to remove your lenses'' at night, said Dr. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, chairman of contact lens section of the American <ORGANIZATION> Optometric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` I encourage my patients to try to wear them on a daily-wear basis and avoid wearing their lenses overnight,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacRae </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's easy to start wearing a lens for one night and having it turn into 10 nights.'' The latest research estimates that about 12,000 contact-lens users in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> suffer corneal ulcers each year, largely because they wear their lenses to bed. The studies also showed, however, that even ordinary daytime use of contacts _ while far safer than overnight wear _ seems to slightly raise the odds of these ulcers. The research found that people who use extended-wear lenses day and night were 10 to 15 times more likely than strictly daytime users to have eye ulcers. Sleeping with ordinary soft lenses just twice a month resulted in nine times the usual risk of the disease. `` Our paper shows that overnight wear is the major risk factor,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schein </PERSON>. `` It begins with even the first night of overnight wear. To some extent there is a risk with any kind of contact lens wear, whether they are hard or soft, worn daily or extended.'' The study also found that the level of lens care among users was `` alarmingly low.'' While it suggested that proper cleaning helped reduce the hazards of extended-wear contacts, it did not eliminate the risk. Spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kase </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bausch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lomb </ORGANIZATION>, a contact lens manufacturer, said his company believes extended-wear contacts are safe, but the research `` will reinforce the importance of remembering that these are medical devices. They need to be taken care of.'' The research was conducted by <PERSON> Schein </PERSON>, an ophthalmologists at <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Eye and Ear Infirmary in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poggio </PERSON>, a biostatistician at <ORGANIZATION> Abt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>. It was financed by contact lens manufacturers and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. An estimated 18 million Americans wear contact lenses. Of these, 9 million wear ordinary soft contacts, 4 million use extended-wear soft lenses and the rest wear hard or rigid gas-permeable lenses. The researchers looked for links between contact lenses and ulcerative keratitis, or ulcers of the cornea, the transparent tissue that covers the eyeball. These ulcers may puncture the cornea, causing permanent blindness, or leave scars that partially block or blur sight. They estimate that 22 to 32 cases of these ulcers occur annually for each 10,000 people who use extended-wear lenses overnight, and 2 to 3 cases occur per 10,000 daily-wear users. <PERSON> Schein </PERSON> said the ulcers are almost unheard of unless people wear contacts or have some other clear risk factor, such as an eye injury. The researchers estimated that each year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, there are 8,000 cases of corneal ulcers among users of extended wear contacts and 4,000 among those who use daily-wear lenses. `` Although contact lenses are safe for the majority of users and offer certain visual and cosmetic advantages over eyeglasses,'' they wrote, `` both professionals and the public should know that contact lenses are not innocuous and that their use can lead to permanent adverse effects.''

 Requests from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for membership and from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for more money were facing members of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> at the beginning of their annual meetings. Financial leaders from 152 countries were opening the meetings of the twin organizations today, with representatives from 24 debt-strapped developing nations planning to meet behind closed doors to discuss their concerns. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is scheduled to address all the leaders next week. High on the agenda this year is the request by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for membership in the two lending organizations, which would bring Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s government a greater role in world affairs outside his nation's allies. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has opposed membership for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. There have been suggestions recently that the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> should concentrate in the next decade on bringing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into the economic framework of the non-communist world. Membership would also allow the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to claim loans from the twin organizations. In advance of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meetings, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> announced Wednesday that he intends to resume new loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the near future, but refused to name a date. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the bank's largest borrower after <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, has been getting $ 2 billion in loans a year. But <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> suspended consideration of $ 780 million in new loans after the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy forces in June. The bank has continued to disburse loans granted to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the past. In addition to the Soviet and Chinese matters, delegates were expected to discuss: _ the Third World's $ 1.3 trillion debt, and the progress of <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s plan for reducing the burden Agreements have been tentatively reached for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, but the problem of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the Third World's biggest debtor, has not yet been tackled. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> will be the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative at the meetings. _ how to deal financially with the worsening state of the environment, especially in developing countries _ <PERSON> Conable </PERSON>'s bid for $ 14.5 billion in contributions to make easy loans over three years to about 35 countries where the average income is only about $ 1 a day or less `` These are the poorest of the poor,'' he told reporters Wednesday.

 Federal drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> went outside with a bullhorn to give his anti-drug message to schoolchildren after a bomb threat forced police to evacuate an elementary school. No bomb was found and Police Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> said he believed the threat was a prank. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> did n't consider it a laughing matter. `` It's a sad thing. This is what drugs have done to this country,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said after Wednesday afternoon's assembly at <ORGANIZATION> Chambers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Anyone who would make such a threat to harm children is `` small and petty and wicked,'' he said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> spoke to more than 700 pupils and 45 faculty members at the school. It was the last in a series of meetings with <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> mayors, ministers and officials in which <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> outlined the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's four-pronged, $ 7.9 billion proposal to fight drug abuse. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he plans to carry his anti-drug message to all 50 states before Thanksgiving. Funding for police departments in poor neighborhoods must be increased to protect the majority of residents who are not drug users, he said. `` Good education, rehabilitation and job training programs are not going to fluorish if the bad guys control the streets,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` We need as a matter of national policy to build more prisons.''

 An attorney for <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> says the former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary is deciding whether he will testify as demanded by a subpoena from a congressional panel. `` We are forced to review each and every option,'' including whether to the refuse to answer questions by invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, said attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perito </PERSON>. A House Government Operations subcommittee voted unanimously Wednesday to subpoena <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> to testify about alleged influence-peddling and mismanagement at the Housing and <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> he once headed. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was ordered to appear on three separate occasions _ the first before the employment and housing subcommittee. He faces contempt of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> proceedings if he does not appear. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> provoked anger among the panel members when he demanded a third delay on the eve of his scheduled voluntary testimony last Friday. `` I think the subcommittee had no option,'' said subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` The subcommittee had an agreement with Mr. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> ... That agreement was broken unilaterally by Mr <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Perito </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> _ who appeared voluntarily before the panel in May _ was willing to testify but needed another two weeks' time for preparation. In a letter to the panel received before the vote, he said: `` We believe the subcommittee's vindictive and punitive actions in denying Mr. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> adequate time to obtain and review pertinent documents and in insisting on use of subpoenas are taken in retaliation against Mr. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s exercise of his constitutional right.'' Republicans and Democrats alike rejected that claim, saying <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> had months of time for preparation _ even though <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said he only hired a lawyer this month. `` Rather than coming forth and clearing the record ... he is toying with the subcommittee in order to evade or avoid his responsibility,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> Congressional staff attorneys said refusal by a former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> official to testify could appear to invite efforts to appoint a special prosecutor under the law providing for a court-appointed independent counsel to handle investigations of current or former top executive branch officials. Already, some <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members are calling for a special prosecutor or suggested one would be needed if the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> does not clarify whether it is investigating possible criminal violations by former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials who are principals in the subcommittee's investigation The subpoenas call for <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> to appear next Tuesday, followed by other appearances on Oct. 27 and Nov. 3. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said the dates could be changed at his discretion, and he raised the possibility that further testimony by <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> could be required. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said because of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s actions, he no longer felt bound by their previous agreement to limit the scope of the subcommittee's questioning to three matters: <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s previous voluntary testimony of May 25; his actions involving a <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, housing project; and the case involving <ORGANIZATION> DRG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted mortgage coinsurance business with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and left the government with huge defaults Since <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> appeared before the panel in May, subcommittee members say inconsistencies and contradictions in his testimony have emerged.

 Thousands of Cambodians threw Vietnamese troops flowers today as <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> began a pledged final withdrawal from an 11-year war against resistance forces its superior firepower could not suppress. In the government-organized ceremony, vehicles carrying thousands of soldiers bearing rifles rumbled out of this northwestern province after a band played pop music. A commander waved flowers in the lead. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says it is conducting a six-day withdrawal of its last 26,000 troops from Siem Reap and several other areas of the country. But opposing guerrilla forces charge that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is faking the troop movement and actually hiding and disguising its troops. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> on Christmas Day 1978 and within two weeks toppled the fanatical <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime, installing a pro-Hanoi government in the capital of <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. During its four-year rule, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians as it tried at the point of a gun to turn the country into an agrarian commune. It also launched bloody attacks on the Vietnamese border. At the height of its conflict with <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> guerrillas, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> had 200,000 men in the country, according to Vietnamese officers. They say <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> began annual partial pullouts in 1982 and that 55,300 Vietnamese died fighting the Cambodians, 25,000 of them in 1977 and 1978. The invasion also brought economic blockades by non-Communist countries that kept <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> one of the world's poorest counties. With the collapse of peace talks in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> last month, the pullout would leave the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government fighting a coalition of up to 50,000 guerrillas backed by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and other countries. Each side claims the other has received increased shipments of arms in recent months. <PERSON> Phnom </PERSON> <PERSON> Penh </PERSON>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> returned home today after talks in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> on arranging a cease-fire and said it was now up to the guerrillas to agree to halt fighting. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Huol </PERSON> <PERSON> Savorn </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s 4th <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION>, said he expected a major guerrilla offensive after the pullout of the some 10,000 soldiers of `` Front 479'' from Siem Reap, <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Oddar </PERSON> <PERSON> Meanchey </PERSON> provinces. These malarial, jungled <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border provinces are among those most strongly contested by the guerrillas. `` They are going to fight a lot'' to try to occupy border areas before striking inland, he told reporters. `` But they will not be able to achieve this,'' he said. `` With the equipment that they have, they can only carry out hit-and-run attacks. The main thing is they do n't have enough food and equipment.'' He said the guerrillas were outnumbered three to one, and they had different aims and refused to cooperate with each other. The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> talks failed to agree on international monitoring of the troop movement, and the only official foreign observers seen in Siem Reap were from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and its close allies <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Of the absence of Western observers, Soviet delegate and <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Genrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinreed </PERSON> said `` it was astonishing why they insisted -LRB- on international monitoring -RRB- but did n't come.'' His four-member team was led by <PERSON> Suleimenov </PERSON> <PERSON> Oljas </PERSON>, member of the Supreme Soviet, or parliament. A four-member team Soviet was led by <PERSON> Suleimenov </PERSON> <PERSON> Oljas </PERSON>, member of the Supreme Soviet, or the parliament. About 50 journalists from non-Communist countries watched the troop movement. The Cambodians bade the soldiers farewell in a two-hour ceremony on the rain-soaked gravel road outside a kindergarten built by Vietnamese soldiers. Banners expressing sadness at the troops' departure and hopes for continued Vietnamese-Cambodian `` solidarity'' were raised by groups of students, soldiers, and schoolchildren wearing red kerchiefs _ the `` young pioneers'' of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Cambodian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. They sweated under a hot sun. On a wooden stage with the military officers, four <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks in flowing saffron robes chanted prayers for peace. Cambodian and Vietnamese officials took turns with speeches that denounced <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> `` genocide'' and claimed the guerrillas can not take any territory. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Anh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lon </PERSON>, commander of Front 479, hugged a <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> commander in front of a blue banner displaying the national emblems of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s yellow star and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Angkor Wat temple. A young pioneer gave him her kerchief while three women in traditional costumes presented a bouquet of flowers. The general walked down the muddied road where the army vehicles were waiting, picked up a young boy, and climbed into his weather-beaten U.S.-made jeep to begin the withdrawal. The troops carried back bamboo mats, water jugs, guitars, even yawning dogs and a monkey on their trucks, buses and armored personnel carriers. `` We are very happy to be leaving,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Duong </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> <PERSON> Viet </PERSON>, whose chest pocket was crowded with medals. `` We feel Cambodians can defend their own country.'' The soldiers, whose intervention sparked fighting that killed tens of thousands of people and split almost all <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> into two hostile camps, smiled and waved yellow and purple flowers as they disappeared down the road. At a press conference Wednesday in <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, the defense ministry's chief spokesman refused to rule out fighting another war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. If the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> threatened the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government's rule and asked <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> for assistance, the Vietnamese army `` would then announce its decision,'' said Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Thai </PERSON>.

In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ home to about 1.5 million people of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> descent _ churches, city officials, pop music stars and others are collecting money and supplies to send. About 1.1 million of the island's 3.7 million residents live in the capital of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>. `` My office has been inundated by the calls and visits. People just want to help,'' <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Borough </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrer </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Ferrer </PERSON> had tried in vain to reach his grandmother, aunts and uncles in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> after the storm. They finally called Wednesday. `` All is well,'' <PERSON> Ferrer </PERSON> said. `` But now there are a lot of other aunts and uncles who need some help.'' The Department of Puerto Rican Community Affairs, a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> office of the Commonwealth of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, is coordinating the relief effort. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> asked its churches to collect money this weekend for relief work throughout the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. The hurricane struck the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>.

Drummer <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> and singers <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> <PERSON> Chacon </PERSON> are scheduled to perform at a benefit concert at Nassau Coliseum in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Uniondale </LOCATION> Sunday to raise $ 250,000 for the hurricane victims. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barnabas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> plans to send two doctors and three nurses to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> to provide medical services and seek out relatives of staff members. Hospital employees already have raised $ 20,000. `` We're a community hospital and we have a large Hispanic population and many of our employees have families there,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Zito </PERSON>, a hospital spokeswoman. Parishioners from <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Queen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angels </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> started a food drive and took to the streets for donations. Rev. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevigny </PERSON>, the pastor, said many parishioners are worried about relatives. `` Some are still waiting for information,'' <PERSON> Sevigny </PERSON> said. `` People have been gathering in front of the church after liturgies and talking about what they have learned.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Nicanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lana </PERSON>, pastor of <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>'s Holy Rosary Church, also has held masses and collected canned food and money. The cash and goods will go directly to churches run by the Augustinian Order, which runs Holy Rosary. `` We have our own men there,'' <PERSON> Lana </PERSON> said. `` They know much better the situation there. We are going to deliver them into the right hands.'' <PERSON> Ferrer </PERSON> said among the items he was asked to find for the relief effort are 200 chainsaws. `` I do n't know where I'm going to find them,'' he said, `` but I'll try.''

<NOTE>Report Says Fighter Defects Undermine Combat Readiness</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Test equipment the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> uses to determine the effectiveness of radar-warning receivers and other electronics on tactical fighters has been faulty and unreliable, a new report says. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, an investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that the problems with the test equipment undermine the combat readiness of the aircraft and the ability of the planes to fly combat missions. The aircraft are equipped with electronic warfare systems consisting of a radar-warning receiver that alerts the pilot when his airplane is being tracked by enemy radar and a jammer that transmits signals to deceive enemy radar. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study found that at five tactical units in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, almost half of about 455 jammers the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> deemed ready for combat had undetected defects. `` The cost for this kind of carelessness can be staggering,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on legislation and national security, which had requested the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report `` And the risk it poses to our national security and to the lives of our pilots is simply unacceptable.'' The study attributed the problems to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition process. In one instance, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> purchased 72 test sets at a cost of $ 272 million before testing them.

 Field testing of genetically modified plants and microorganisms `` will not pose any hazard'' to the environment if done carefully under existing laws, says a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> panel. Genetically engineered plants and microbes are `` not intrinsically dangerous,'' the panel concluded in a study released Wednesday.

He said science has no way to evaluate the risks of releasing such organisms into the environment. <PERSON> Burris </PERSON>, who was chairman of the academy's committee on evaluation of introduction of gene-modified microorganisms and plants, that some 80 modified plants and microbes have been tested in the environment and `` we have n't had any accidents as yet.''

 The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen today, while the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index rose. The dollar closed at 145.00 yen, down 1.25 yen from Wednesday's 146.25-yen finish It opened at 144.90 yen and ranged between 144.82 yen and 145.25 yen. It had gained 0.52 yen on Wednesday but opened sharply lower in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today after declining overnight on overseas markets on speculation that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank might raise interest rates. As the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market awaited the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>'s scheduled meeting later today, exchange dealings were slow, said <PERSON> Toru </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanai </PERSON>, a foreign exchange analyst with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Spot volume was estimated at $ 5.6 billion `` Participants slowed their dollar buying only temporarily prior to the West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> meeting and the G-7,'' <PERSON> Kanai </PERSON> said, referring to the meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations. `` After all, the dollar will remain strong.'' At the G-7 meeting, market players are watching for any measures to curb the dollar's strength. The weekend meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will bring together the finance ministers of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 274.44 points today, or 0.80 percent, closing at 34,745.02. It had lost 0.49 points the previous day. The index began rising soon after the market opened as investors were reassured by the yen's overnight jump against the dollar, dealers said. It rose further in the afternoon on investment trusts' buying of small amounts of a wide variety of issues, but institutional investors remained reluctant to make major moves ahead of the international monetary talks, said a dealer with a major securities firm in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Masahiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Umemori </PERSON>, a stock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Participants were buying supermarket issues considering that reorganization and easing regulations on large-scale retail stores could be positive steps to improve U.S.-Japan structural problems.'' Trading was thin, with first-section volume estimated at 650 million shares, up from 600 million Wednesday. Among gainers were supermarket, department store, bank and shipbuilding shares.

 By the thousands, residents armed with jugs and buckets scrambled for water in this hurricane-stricken city while authorities opened fire hydrants and delivered water in tank trucks. Gov. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> said late Wednesday that he feared the prolonged power outage could cause pose a health hazard as residents discard spoiled food in the street in 90-degree heat. Trash collectors have not worked since before Hurricane Hugo hit Monday. Power began returning to many <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> neighborhoods late Wednesday and all power should be restored by today, said <PERSON> Esteban </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, assistant director of the island's <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. However, tens of thousands of residents of eastern <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> will not have water or electricity until early October, he said. Seventy percent of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commonwealth of 3.3 million, was without water Wednesday. The power authority was working at 40 percent capacity, <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> said the government's priority was to find temporary housing for an estimated 129,000 people whose homes were either destroyed or severely damaged by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cargo planes were flying food, water and other supplies to the offshore islands of <LOCATION> Culebra </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION>, the hardest hit parts of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, where up to 80 percent of the homes were destroyed. In <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON>, 60, said she watched her wooden house being demolished by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> as she sat in a neighbor's cement house. `` I wanted to cry and scream, but I could n't,'' she said. Her dog, who used to guard the house, sat in front of the ruins. Mayor <PERSON> Manuela </PERSON> <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> <PERSON> Collazo </PERSON> said half of <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION>' 8,000 residents were homeless. She said virtually all the wooden houses were wiped out. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> director of disaster services, <PERSON> Scotti </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON>, said from <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, that a team of 50 relief specialists would arrive in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> today. Supplies of bottled water in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> supermarkets were dwindling and hundreds of residents drove south across the island to <LOCATION> Ponce </LOCATION> and west to <LOCATION> Arecibo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mayaguez </LOCATION> to stock up on water, ice and gasoline. People stood in long lines at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> tanker trucks filling water buckets, and bathed with soap at open fire hydrants. `` We've gone three days without washing,'' said one resident, <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. Police spokesman <PERSON> Baltasar </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> said there were several cases of looting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> and towns in the northeast. `` These people are taking advantage of the chaos to carry out robberies and assaults,'' he said. <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> said there also were reports of youths stopping motorists to either steal cars or gasoline, ice and other provisions they were carrying. Hundreds of tourists jammed <ORGANIZATION> Munoz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, which reopened Wednesday. Many were turned back because of overbooked flights. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION>, said insurers expected to receive `` tens of millions of dollars'' in damage claims. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> said damages to the island would be between $ 100 million and $ 200 million. In <LOCATION> Culebra </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> said: `` There is no way to estimate the damage. We've been put back 25 years.'' Conditions were also difficult on islands east of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> hit hard. On the British island of <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION> Chief Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> said the island had only enough food to last until the end of the week and that rationing might be necessary. `` People are hungry, homeless and do n't know what to do,'' he said. Officials of the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> reported damage of more than $ 150 million. The government said more than a third of the private homes were ruined on the island of <LOCATION> Tortola </LOCATION>. On Wednesday night, a French helicopter plunged into the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> about half a mile southeast of the outlying island of <LOCATION> Desirade </LOCATION> as it evacuated an islander who suffered head injuries when <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> struck, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The body of the islander, <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Berchel </PERSON>, later washed up on a beach, they said. Searchers in a helicopter and fishing boats continued today to look for the eight missing, including <PERSON> Berchel </PERSON>'s son, three medical workers and the twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION>'s crew of four The cause of the accident was unknown.

 More than 500 people overflowed a church for the funeral of former child abduction victim <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>, killed in a motorcycle crash four months after a TV movie depicted his seven-year ordeal. His abduction by a convicted child molester left <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON> scarred, family and friends said at Wednesday's service. `` <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> had a hard time getting his feet back on the ground, too, because of all the experiences he had. And even when everything was going well, something would kick him back,'' said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>'s minister. `` His dad says, though, that <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> did the best that he could.'' <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>, 24, was killed Saturday when he hit a car that pulled in front of his motorcycle. The motorist, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Loera </PERSON>, 28, fled, but surrendered at the Mexican border Tuesday night, authorities said. He was arraigned Wednesday on charges of felony hit-and-run driving and manslaughter. <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON> was snatched at age 7 from a Merced street in 1972 by <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>, 53, and held with lies that his family could n't care for him anymore He resurfaced in March 1980 when he took another kidnap victim, <PERSON> Timmy </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, then 5, to the <LOCATION> Ukiah </LOCATION> police station 200 miles north of <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>'s hometown. `` When he came home, it was like we had known him all of our lives, just as though he had never gone. He brought our broken-hearted family together,'' <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Jody </PERSON>, told mourners who filled a small Mormon church and adjoining gymnasium. But life never again was entirely normal for young <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON> or his family because of the publicity his case attracted. `` When <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> returned after seven years, he was not just mom and pop's son,'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said. `` They had to share him with the rest of the nation. This was hard for them.'' <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>'s story was depicted in May in an <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> movie, `` I Know My First Name is <PERSON> Steven </PERSON>.'' But <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said the character portrayed `` was n't the real <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>. He was n't rude to his parents. He was a loving son.'' <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON> finished high school, married in 1985 and had two children, now ages 3 and 2. <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>, who had been convicted of child molestation before <PERSON> Steven </PERSON>'s abduction, spent five years in prison for the two kidnappings before he was released on parole in 1985. He faced no sex charges in either case, though <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> testified during an 18-day trial that he was regularly sexually abused.

 The people who wrestled convicted `` Night Stalker'' killer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> to the ground and held him for police expressed gratitude at his conviction as they relived that fateful day. `` I feel really good, like it is all over now,'' said <PERSON> Faustino </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinon </PERSON>, one of those who struggled with <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> when the killer tried to steal his daughter's car on Aug. 31, 1985. A jury Wednesday convicted <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> of 13 murders and 30 felonies. Jurors also found circumstances that made <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> eligible for the death penalty. A sentencing hearing is pending. `` The verdict brought back a lot of memories of that day and I'm glad it's ended,'' said <PERSON> Pinon </PERSON>, who watched the news of the conviction on the television in his small wood and stucco home Daughter <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> watched the news at work, on a small television set she hid under her desk. `` I just yelled out, ` yeah!' when I heard what's going to happen to him. I think he got what he had coming,'' she said. One neighborhood resident who was n't watching the television news was <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgoin </PERSON>, 59, who captured <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> with the help of his sons, <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON>, 22. He learned of the convictions from a daughter, who called from work, and several neighbors who stopped by to chat on his wooden porch. `` Well, I knew he was guilty and that he had done many bad things, and if the court found him guilty, well, that's the way it is,'' said <PERSON> Burgoin </PERSON>. `` Now he'll have to pay the price.'' The day of his arrest, <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> had been spotted in several nearby places by people who had recognized his picture from news reports. Witnesses called police and officers were sent to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> areas where he had been sighted. On <LOCATION> Hubbard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> struggled with <PERSON> Pinon </PERSON> for the Mustang before giving up and trying to take another car, occupied by <PERSON> Angie </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Torre </PERSON>. <PERSON> Burgoin </PERSON>, who said he was mowing his lawn at the time, saw Mrs. De la <PERSON> Torre </PERSON> struggling with <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> and ran to help. He pulled <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> from the car and he and his sons held him until sheriff's deputies arrived minutes later. <PERSON> Burgoin </PERSON> said he learned after <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>' arrest that he had been sought for a string of slayings that had terrorized <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> during the summer of 1985. `` It's me! It's me! It's me! I'm lucky the cops caught me,'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> reportedly shouted in Spanish as he was arrested. Word of the arrest spread quickly, and by the time <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> arrived at the police station for questioning, 500 people had gathered outside shouting, `` Kill him! Kill him!''

<HEAD>Study Finds AIDS Infection in 27 Percent of Male Prostitutes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than one-quarter of male prostitutes studied in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> were infected with the AIDS virus, and the virus was especially common among those also exposed to syphilis and hepatitis, according to a report today. Until now, most studies of AIDS among prostitutes have focused on females. In the latest work, researchers took blood samples from 152 male prostitues. Overall, 27 percent were infected with HIV, the AIDS virus, as were 55 percent who also had syphilis and 37 percent who had been exposed to hepatitis B. Forty-six percent of the prostitutes described themselves as being heterosexual. The rest said they were bisexual or homosexual. The survey was conducted by Dr. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elifson </PERSON> and colleagues from <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. It was published as a letter in the New England Journal of Medicine. `` The rate of HIV-1 infection in our sample suggests the need for continued educational, drug-treatment and outreach efforts for male prostitutes and their sexual partners,'' they wrote.

 The need to keep their offspring cool prompts Asian bees to produce `` yellow rain,'' excrement the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government once believed was a Soviet biological weapon, researchers reported today. `` The phenomenon has never been adequately explained. We're providing an explanation,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kevan </PERSON>, a biologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guelph </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and co-author of the study published in Nature, a British science journal During the `` mass defecation flights,'' thousands of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> giant honeybees fly in swarms and relieve themselves of hot feces equal to 20 percent of their weight, allowing them to cool their nests more efficiently to help their offspring grow, the study concluded. `` It can be explained by the need to prevent the temperature of bees' nests becoming so hot as to endanger the larvae,'' wrote <PERSON> Kevan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Makhdzir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mardan </PERSON>, a biologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Malaysia </ORGANIZATION>. In a 1981 speech and 1982 report, then-Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> asserted that `` yellow rain'' was a Soviet weapon derived from fungal toxins and used to kill thousands of people in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> during the 1970s. That claim was quickly attacked by <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Meselson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> biologist who argued the yellow spots left on plants was bee excrement. In 1987, <PERSON> Meselson </PERSON> and others published an article in Foreign Policy magazine that `` demolishes definitively'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>'s claim, the magazine's editor, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON>, said at the time. That article, based on declassified documents, revealed that <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> investigators who visited <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> during 1983-1985 concluded <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>'s theory was wrong. Nevertheless, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> replied they had no reason to question <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>'s assertions. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government made a mistake, <PERSON> Kevan </PERSON> said by phone from <LOCATION> Guelph </LOCATION>, about 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. `` It's an embarrassing mistake, to say the least. One can understand why they do n't back down.'' He and <PERSON> Mardan </PERSON> took 306 bees from six nests in <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> tropical forests before and after the insects made mass flights. They killed the bees, weighed their gut contents and measured the amount of heat in the bee droppings. The study determined that the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> giant honeybees excrete large amounts of hot waste during the mass flights. `` It's like somebody weighing 200 pounds suddenly losing 40 pounds,'' <PERSON> Kevan </PERSON> said, adding that a colony of 40,000 bees eliminates 1,850 calories of heat during a single flight. This behavior does n't directly cool the bees, but lets them cool their nests 35 percent more efficiently through a process known as `` gobbetting,'' which also is used by European honeybees, <PERSON> Kevan </PERSON> said. During gobbetting, a bee regurgitates some nectar so some of the liquid in it evaporates on its tongue. Then, the bee swallows the cooled nectar. `` It's like drinking cold water on a hot day,'' <PERSON> Kevan </PERSON> said. The mass defecation flights mean the bees have less body weight to cool by gobbetting, allowing them to cool themselves and thus their nests more easily. At temperatures much higher or lower than 92 degrees Fahrenheit, bee larvae growth slows and malformed bees are more likely, <PERSON> Kevan </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Mardan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kevan </PERSON> found 80 percent of the mass flights happened when the bee colonies were under the greatest heat stress: during mornings when temperatures rose most rapidly and during windless late afternoons.

 Actress <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> testified her arrest for an expired auto registration tag resembled Nazi Gestapo tactics and made her think her life was in danger. `` I was screaming, ` Help, help, help!''' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> said Wednesday during her second day of testimony in her misdemeanor trial. `` I was afraid of the police. They were going to shoot me.'' The former Hungarian beauty queen, believed to be in her late 60s, wore the same outfit _ including a brightly flowered, knee-length skirt with petticoats _ to court that she wore on June 14, the day she was arrested. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> testified that during her arrest, she was handcuffed and `` plunked down'' on the curb next to her <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> convertible. `` They do n't give a damn about me. I was sitting on the floor half nude,'' she testified. She denied threatening to `` call the Reagans'' or demanding that Officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, who arrested her, be fired. `` I recall somebody chasing me like the Gestapo wanted to shoot me,'' she said. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> also launched into a stream of invective against <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>. `` He was <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in one,'' she said. `` I ca n't believe an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayer can be treated like this for an expired registration.'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> is charged with battery on a police officer, disobeying an officer's orders, driving with an expired license and having an open container of alcohol -LRB- a flask of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> whiskey in the glove compartment -RRB- in her car. If convicted, she faces a possible 18-month jail sentence. On Tuesday, she admitted she scuffled with <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> after he pulled her over for having expired license tags. But she said she acted in self-defense, giving him more of a pat than a slap.

 Striking miners ended a four-day occupation of a coal processing plant hours after a court-imposed deadline, but the union said it would use the tactic again to increase pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We're going to hurt this company economically,'' <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, said after leading the occupying strikers to a rally outside the plant gates Wednesday night. `` We're going to cut off their production until they wake up and we're going to do it peacefully,'' he said, adding that the union could attempt to occupy another <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> plant as early as next week. Ninety-five of <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s striking miners along with three union officials and a religious leader voluntarily ended their occupation of the seven-story building after ignoring a federal judge's deadline for a little more than two hours `` We got a lot of miles per gallon out of this effort and we've got a lot more gas in the tank,'' said <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, the union's southeast regional coordinator and one of those who occupied the A human barricade of 3,000 supporters outside the plant protected the occupying team. The supporters joined miners and other union members from throughout <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> at a rally in front of the plant as darkness fell. Some state troopers drove off at dusk and law enforcement authorities let the deadline pass without trying to get inside the plant. The troopers withdrew a short distance down the road `` to let them have the rally without any interference,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a state police spokesman. He said no specific time had been set for removing the occupiers. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said the union proved its strength without forcing a confrontation. `` We stood the state on its head,'' he said. `` We shocked <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> and totally cut off their production at their most productive processing plant for four days and we did that non-violently. Everybody stood in the road and locked arms in solidarity and nobody could do anything with that power.'' Earlier, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the miners would face no penalties if they left the plant before the deadline. Otherwise, he said they would lose their $ 200 a week in <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> strike benefits and face contempt charges while the union would be fined $ 600,000 for each day of the occupation. It was n't clear if they would face penalties for not leaving by the deadline. The unarmed demonstrators stormed the plant Sunday when only a dozen security officers were on the grounds. They barricaded themselves inside the control room and shut down production at the plant, where coal is cleaned, sorted and shipped. Replacement workers had been operating the plant since the strike began in April, although production has been about half of normal. Union leaders said they wanted to make a dramatic public statement about what they consider unfair treatment by the company, which they contend is trying to break the union. Massive fines have taken away all other avenues of peaceful protest, such as sit-down demonstrations and mass picketing, they said. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> called the demonstrators terrorists and said Wednesday, `` We will seek full prosecution under the law.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,695 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> employees from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> have been on strike over wages and working conditions. Union members at other coal companies staged wildcat strikes in June and July. Although <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> offered the demonstrators and the union amnesty, <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Passino </PERSON> said they still could face state penalties. A state judge already has fined the union nearly $ 17 million based on charges of illegal strike activities brought by the company. Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was launching an investigation of the labor dispute He did not give a timetable.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gunmen killed a Sunni Moslem member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and his driver in Syrian-controlled west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today, police said. A police spokesman, who can not be identified in line with regulations, said <PERSON> Nazim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadri </PERSON>, 74, `` died instantly from bullet wounds in the head and chest.'' No group claimed responsibility for the assassination of <PERSON> Kadri </PERSON>, the third Sunni public figure slain in 27 months. The police spokesman said three men got out of a red <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> and fired AK-47 automatic rifles at <PERSON> Kadri </PERSON>'s brown Mercedes sedan this morning a few yards from the nine-story apartment building where the lawmaker lived. <PERSON> Kadri </PERSON>'s police driver, Sgt. <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON>, also was killed in the attack and a bystander, <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Itani </PERSON>, was slightly wounded in the left arm, the spokesman said. `` Immediately after emptying about two clips of 30 bullets each into <PERSON> Kadri </PERSON>'s car, the gunmen jumped into their Mercedes and sped away while shooting in the air,'' the police spokesman said. He said a police car rushed <PERSON> Kadri </PERSON> and <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> but they were already dead. Witnesses said <PERSON> Kadri </PERSON> was gunned down shortly after having a haircut at a barber's shop across the street from his home. One witness, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Kadri </PERSON>'s car was intercepted by the gunmen minutes after he left the barber's shop Syrian soldiers rushed to the area, sealed off the murder scene and took several witnesses for questioning, `` including the barber,'' the witness added. <PERSON> Kadri </PERSON>, survived by a wife and seven daughters, represented the central <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s one-chamber parliament since 1972. Since <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war began 14 years ago, 26 seats of the 99-member <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> have been left vacant by deaths, many by natural causes. The war has prevented parliamentary elections but the remaining members periodically have voted for renewal of its four-year mandate since 1976, a year after the war began. The other prominent Sunni Moslems killed in the past 27 months were Grand Mufti <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Karami </PERSON>. <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON> was killed in a car bomb explosion in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> May 16, and <PERSON> Karami </PERSON> died in a bomb blast aboard an army helicopter that was flying him from northern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> June 1, 1987. The economically powerful Sunni community is not involved in the current six-month confrontation pitting the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> troops of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> against Syrian and allied forces. Since the fighting began March 8, 926 people have been killed and 2,725 wounded, by police count.

 A jury found a former nursing home aide guilty of killing five incapacitated patients in a pact with a lesbian lover, and families of the victims celebrated the verdict outside the court. `` My mother can finally rest in peace,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunderman </PERSON>, daughter of victim Marguarite Chambers. `` The scars will always be there, but it helps knowing the truth.'' A jury deliberated about five hours Wednesday before finding <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> guilty on five counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in the deaths at <LOCATION> Alpine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nursing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Home </LOCATION> in Walker. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, 26, looked down and showed no emotion as the verdicts were read. She faces a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole. No sentencing date was set. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Engman </PERSON>, daughter of victim <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, said she was thrilled with the verdict. `` I did n't have any doubts at all,'' she said. `` I wish we had the death penalty.'' With a lack of hard evidence, the case rested largely on the testimony of <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s accomplice and former lover. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, who already has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, testified that <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> smothered patients with washcloths because it `` relieved tension.'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, also a nurse's aide at Alpine Manor, said the two had formed a love pact, each agreeing to kill patients so they would be bound to one another for life. The victims were <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, 60; <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, 79; <PERSON> Belle </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkhard </PERSON>, 74; <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, 97; and <PERSON> Myrtle </PERSON> <PERSON> Luce </PERSON>, 95. The women, all severely incapacitated and many suffering from Alzheimer's disease, were killed between January and April 1987. Defense attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Piazza </PERSON> said he planned to ask the judge to set aside the verdict. `` I'm surprised and disappointed,'' <PERSON> Piazza </PERSON> said. `` There was no physical evidence whatsoever.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, testifying Tuesday, denied that any murders had occurred at the home and said the murder plot was nothing more than a joke made up by <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> that had gotten out of hand. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said a jealous <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> went to police with the story after <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> left her for another lover and moved to her hometown of <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Her denials contradicted testimony of several former co-workers and friends who said she admitted suffocating patients at Alpine Manor. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s former lover, <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Baragar </PERSON>, testified that <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> often confessed to her and would `` joke around about it.'' Another woman testified <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> had shown her `` souvenirs,'' such as an anklet and a balloon, they said they had taken from their victims. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> testified that she stood watch while <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> suffocated one patient, but lacked the nerve to kill any of the patients herself. The deaths had been ruled natural, and no autopsies were performed. Police began investigating last October after <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s ex-husband told them she had confessed her part in the murder plot Autopsies were performed on the only two bodies that were not cremated, but no definitive evidence of suffocation was found. `` Even though we still find it difficult to believe that any of this actually happened ... we will continue to place our trust in our system of justice,'' said a statement from the nursing home. In his closing arguments, Assistant Kent County Prosecutor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schieber </PERSON> speculated that <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> herself may not know why she killed the women. `` It was murder for its own pleasure,'' he said.

On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> voted unanimously to approve <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> as the next chancellor of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> public schools. `` He will stand as a splendid role model,'' board President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said of 53-year-old <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> for lowering the dropout rate in <LOCATION> Miami-Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> schools while increasing parent and student involvement in individual schools. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> will face a daunting list of problems in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, including overcrowded schools, a high dropout rate and a decentralized system which has been stung by patronage and corruption scandals. `` I like a challenge,'' said <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. `` If you put well-intentioned people together, people with their hearts in the right place, I think they can do something for the kids.'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> would start in January or February and would be paid $ 195,000 a year under an 18-month contract. The salary is $ 40,000 more than <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> receives in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and $ 45,000 more than the previous chancellor, the late <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, was paid. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 102,000 teachers, assistants, counselors, psychologists and secretaries in the city's schools, praised <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> for emphasizing `` school-based management and shared decision making.'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said that before <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> took over <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s schools, there were two applicants for each teaching vacancy. Now there are six. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> was one of three finalists in the search that began after <PERSON> Green </PERSON> died of an asthma attack in May. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> `` Bud'' <PERSON> Spillane </PERSON>, superintendent of schools in <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was interviewed by the board Tuesday and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Prophet </PERSON>, school superintendent of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, withdrew from consideration. In 1987, during the search that was to lead to <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s appointment, the board had asked <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> to apply for the job But <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said the timing was wrong because he had just been named to head the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> system, the nation's fourth biggest. Asked why he said yes this time, <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said, `` Because it is the number one system in the country. ... Maybe we can turn some of the larger school systems in the country around by replicating what we've done in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.'' Eighty percent of the 940,000 children in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s public schools are minorities. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> was the first black chancellor. His two immediate predecessors had been Hispanic. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> is of Puerto Rican heritage. While a student at the old <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> dropped out and joined the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. He received a high school equivalency diploma while in the service and later attended <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He joined the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> school system as a math teacher in 1962 and within 10 years became the city's first Hispanic principal. He and his wife, <PERSON> Lily </PERSON>, have four grown children.

<HEAD>American Professors Incorporate Events of Tiananmen Square into Courses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many American professors are including the recent democracy protests in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and subsequent army crackdown in their courses, and they're finding that the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> massacre has boosted student interest in those courses sharply. Some professors already have begun to teach the lessons of Tiananmen Square this fall while others plan to wait until spring to review the already rich literature spawned by the protests. `` Five or six years after our students graduate, many of them are in positions to make a difference,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Walder </PERSON>, a professor of sociology at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Walder </PERSON> usually teaches a graduate seminar focusing on post-1949 events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but plans this year to examine the years just since 1979. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a professor of government at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, said the demonstrations for democracy that occupied <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square until the army crackdown in early June will form the `` centerpiece'' of a survey of Chinese politics he plans to teach next spring. `` It relates to every thesis of political change in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, `` That is, whether <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authoritarianism was capable of significant economic reform while suppressing political change or alternatively, whether the decade of economic reform in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was forced.'' <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> <PERSON> MacFarquhar </PERSON>, professor of government at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, plans to teach a seminar in Chinese politics to juniors this semester and said that the June protests will take up at least one week of the course. <PERSON> MacFarquhar </PERSON> said he heard from colleagues at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> when he taught a course on the Cultural Revolution several years ago that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials `` wondered why someone at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> was giving a course on it and they were n't. It caused a lively debate.'' As a result, <PERSON> MacFarquhar </PERSON> said the current regime may well be apprised of professors at American universities teaching about Tiananmen Square `` but since they are antagonistic, the reaction at the official level will be negative.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>, associate professor of sociology and vice-chairman of the Center for Chinese Studies at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, said the number of students enrolled in his undergraduate course on contemporary Chinese society has doubled to more than 120 students since he last offered it two years ago. But while Gold expects that the student protests will dominate the course, he said recent events in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> reflected a pattern in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government and society that has existed for centuries. `` It's part of a dichotomy, between a tightening up and a loosening, that goes back thousands of years,'' <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said. `` But Tiananmen Square meant a temporary victory for those people who want to clamp down. What happened in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> has happened many times. Part of the tragedy is how little is new,'' he said. <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said the events in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> `` caught the imagination'' of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students. `` It brought out our respect for human rights and democracy that most people do n't think of very often,'' he said. `` When they saw this in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> it was sort of an ennobling experience. People are trying to understand what happened and once they do it will have a larger impact.''

 The seven Americans aboard the French jetliner that crashed in northern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> included the wife of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> volunteer and four oil workers, authorities said. `` You always think it's going to happen to someone else,'' said <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Huff </PERSON>, whose son, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>, was among 171 passengers aboard the <ORGANIZATION> UTA </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 flight from the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. All aboard the plane died. A radical Shiite group Wednesday claimed responsibility for the downing of a jetliner, the airline <ORGANIZATION> UTA </ORGANIZATION> said. The airline said a bomb most likely caused the crash of the jetliner, which exploded Tuesday shortly after taking off from <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. One passenger was <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>, who decided to travel ahead of her husband, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON> was to help plan the October wedding of her daughter <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>, 26, of suburban <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said Mrs. <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> `` It's been pretty devastating for all of us,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Brawley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` It's hard, particularly when you think of it as a bombing.'' <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Schutzius </PERSON>, 23, another American passenger, had completed a two-year stint with the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and was en route to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to begin two months of travel in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, her mother said. `` She gave her heart and soul to her job and even recommended that I join the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> when I retire,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassett </PERSON>, a bookstore owner in <LOCATION> Fredericksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` She told me how <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s mother joined the Corps showing that age was not a factor.'' Ms. <PERSON> Schutzius </PERSON> taught English to elementary school children and worked with members of <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>'s government to develop an English curriculum in the country's schools, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanigan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Even though it was a terrible tragedy, and her life was short, she stood for a lot while she was with us,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Hassett </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said two Americans working in southern <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> for the company's <ORGANIZATION> Esso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary also were on the UTA flight.

Miss <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said an <ORGANIZATION> Esso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> employee on loan to <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was also on the flight. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>, 29, a senior projects engineer, is Canadian, but listed his hometown as <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, she said.

<HEAD>Pravda Apologizes for Article on Behavior of Boris Yeltsin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: UPDATES thruout to ADD details, quotes, CORRECT spelling of

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda made a rare public apology today for printing an article that accused political maverick <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> of indulging in a boozing and buying spree during his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour. It said the reporter who wrote the story had n't seen the purported binge himself but relied instead on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> newspaper report and hearsay. On Monday, Pravda reprinted an article published by the Italian newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION> that said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> had departed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> leaving `` a wake of catastrophic prophecies, insane expenses, interviews and above all the perfume of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> Black Label'' whiskey. A flushed and angry <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> called the charges `` garbage'' within minutes of returning to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Monday night. The Soviet legislator accused Pravda of seeking `` revenge for the fact Americans received us with admiration.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily said today that it had instructed its <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> correspondent <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Linnik </PERSON> to contact the <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION> reporter who wrote the original article, <PERSON> Vittorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucconi </PERSON>, and check its accuracy. `` Asked whether he stood by the authenticity of everything he wrote about B.N. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> in his article, <PERSON> Zucconi </PERSON> replied he had based it on secondary sources, on a story that appeared in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 13 headlined ` With Drunken Embraces Towards The Capitalists' and the testimony of Soviet emigres who heard talk of <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s conduct in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>,'' Pravda said. The Pravda editorial board then offered its apologies to <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, but seemed to do it grudgingly. The reprint of La Repubblica story was promoted on the front page with excerpts saying <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> found the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` a holiday, a stage, a bar 5,000 kilometers long.'' But Pravda's apology came on the bottom of page 7. Pravda's reprint of <PERSON> Zucconi </PERSON>'s article without comment prompted the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> to publish an editorial sharply criticizing the official organ of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, whose name means `` the truth.'' Noting that the Soviet press practically never tells readers which of their leaders drink or about their shopping habits abroad, the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News editorial said sarcastically, `` About <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, we now know. Pity that such a leap forward in the sphere of glasnost was made by the Soviet press not on its own, but with the help of an Italian newspaper.'' During his nine-city tour that ended Sunday, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> warned Americans that President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could face a revolution if he fails to improve living conditions soon. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, was stripped of the post almost two years ago by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who criticized him as politically immature and overly ambitious. But, in a remarkable political comeback in March, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> won 89 percent of the vote when he ran against an establishment candidate to represent <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. A month and a half ago, he was elected along with Nobel Peace Prize laureate <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and a handful of other reformers to the steering committee of the first organized opposition in the Soviet parliament in almost 70 years.

 The military head of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> edition of Stars and Stripes today rejected allegations of censorship and personnel abuse under his editorship of the newspaper for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` The paper is not censored,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>. `` I've never had anyone, no flag officer or bureaucrat, tell me what stories to write or how they are to run. `` I've been here three years and no one has told me anything like that.'' But a civilian journalist at the newspaper, <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> <PERSON> Brackett </PERSON>, said he was preparing a list of serious problems to be given to the paper's management and to ombusdman <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foisie </PERSON>, who is to arrive Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> appointed <PERSON> Foisie </PERSON> ombudsman in June for the European and Far East editions of Stars and Stripes, with authority to monitor their performance and argue with military brass over decisions about news coverage. He is a former editor with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and a former executive editor of the Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. `` The issue is not simply censorship. It is also abuse of personnel and editorial mismanagement,'' <PERSON> Brackett </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Brackett </PERSON>, who testified before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last winter about conditions at the newspaper, declined to give details before the list is submitted. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, who also testified before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the dispute, said in a telephone interview that he felt <PERSON> Foisie </PERSON> also will represent him. `` Mr. <PERSON> Foisie </PERSON> will have the opportunity to speak with whomever he wishes, and I'm confident he will come to the conclusion we're not censoring the paper,'' he said. The editorial staff consists of 17 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> civilians and 21 military people, <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> disputed <PERSON> Brackett </PERSON>'s claim that <PERSON> Brackett </PERSON> had been disciplined for testifying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brackett </PERSON> has been only temporarily relieved as <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> editor and assigned to be a supervising editor, <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said, `` while we can analyze the latest series of allegations.'' He said it was normal for civilian employees of the government to be relieved of normal duties during an investigation. <PERSON> Brackett </PERSON> said, however, `` I feel my relief is harassment and definitely retribution for having testified to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Brackett </PERSON>, 49, said he was a retired <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officer with about 20 years experience in journalism and in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. There have been a series of disputes involving Stars and Stripes in recent years and they predate the arrival of <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, who previously was a staff officer in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Reporters who have worked for Star and Stripes say their reporting of the news sometimes suffers because military commanders worry about the sensitivities of host countries. The two editions of the paper, published in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, are edited separately and are supposed to be `` hometown newspapers'' for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> service personnel. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> describes them as `` authorized, but unofficial publications'' and their charter says they are to provide `` a free flow of news and information ... without censorship or news management.'' But last year an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, found evidence of censorship and improper managament. The <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sigma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chi </ORGANIZATION>, assisted in that investigation. Democratic Reps. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> have written to Adm. <PERSON> Huntington </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardisty </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, asking him to look into continued allegations. `` What we have here is harassment of whistle-blowers and censorship,'' Ms. <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It's bad enough to censor the news Our men and women in uniform deserve the news as all of us get it, as harsh as it is.''

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> today visited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> troops near the demilitarized zone and denounced Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> as a fanatical dictatorship. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who donned a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> camouflage jacket at one point, inspected a tunnel under the demilitarized zone that was unearthed in 1978 and said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> posed a grave threat to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` If anybody thinks <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is a passive nation, I suggest they go down and visit this tunnel. I think it shows the fanaticism of that country and how far they are willing to go to export destabilization,'' he said. The tunnel is one of several discovered by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops leading from the North into the South under the zone dividing the nations. South Korean officials say the tunnels were to be used in the event of an invasion. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> visited the demilitarized zone on the last day of his visit to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. He then flew to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where he was to meet briefly with Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, who is there on an official visit, and to attend a reception beginning the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> conference. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> will speak Friday at the three-day gathering of 27 conservative parties from 26 democratic nations and meet with a wide array of leaders. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> began a 10-day tour of four Asian nations on Tuesday. He also is to visit the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. North Korean soldiers photographed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, when they visited the border truce village at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> today. Officers came out of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> pavilion to take notes and watch the Quayles, who stared back from a tower on the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> side of the compound. The vice president repeated reassurances that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will keep its 43,000 troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1950 and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intervened on the side of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The nations agreed to a cease-fire in 1953 but technically remain at war. North Korean loudspeakers along the demilitarized zone trumpeted songs and propaganda as the <ORGANIZATION> Quayles </ORGANIZATION> toured the area for four hours. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had lunch with about 100 American soldiers. Spec. 4 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, said he was pleased <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> visited the zone. `` It is great to know that someone is thinking about us over here,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Sixteen Kuwaiti Shiite Moslems were executed today for planting bombs that exploded in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> at the height of the Moslem pilgrimage this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced. The statement, read over the state-run <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> radio, said that another four Kuwaitis received prison terms of 15 and 20 years and 1,000 to 1,500 lashes of the whip. It said another nine Kuwaitis were acquitted. It was the first public word from <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> that anyone had even been arrested in connection with the July 10 explosions, which killed one Pakistani pilgrim and injured 16 pilgrims of various nationalities. The bombs went off as roughly 2 million Moslems were preparing to head to Mount <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> for the culmination of the pilgrimage rites. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is home of Islam's holiest shrines at <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>. Saudi Arabians, including the ruling family, are members of the majority Sunni Moslem sect. The Sunnis and the minority Shiite sect, which prevails in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, are traditional rivals for the alliegance of the world's nearly 1 billon Moslems. The antagonism dates back to a split that occurred in the 7th century. Today's announcement said without elaborating that the executions were carried out in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and `` in accordance with Islamic law.'' Condemned inmates in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> are usually beheaded by sword, often in public squares after Moslem prayers. The defendants, who came to the kingdom in July as pilgrims, belonged to the Moslem Shiite sect and were of Iranian, <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION>, Saudi and Qatari origin, according to the statement. They were all Kuwaiti nationals. The announcement said the defendants, who had been tried before an Islamic court, gave full confessions. It said the confession would be broadcast on television. The announcement said the defendents were tried for `` an evil crime ... an aggression on the sanctity of the holy sites and on the pilgrims ... of the entire Moslem nation.'' The visit of senior <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> officials in recent weeks had prompted reports that the Saudis were holding and interrogating several <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> pilgrims. The latest was a whirlwind visit Tuesday by the Kuwaiti minister of state for foreign affairs, <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ossaimi </PERSON>, to relay a message from the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> leadership. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement said the defendants brought the explosives with them from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, where they also trained on using them. It said they held meetings in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> to plan their `` aggression,'' with the confessed aim of spreading `` terror and fear in the hearts of the pilgrims ... and show that the -LRB- <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> -RRB- was unable to protect the house of God.'' It referred to their carrying out their crime `` at the instructions of the unjust ones, who are enemies of this nation and for all pilgrims of God's house, and cooperating with those unjust ones on such debauchery and terrorism in the most sacred spot in the world.'' The allusion was an apparent reference to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which has been urging Moslems pouring into <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> for the annual Hajj to seize <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> from the ruling <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> family. The Saudi ruling dynasty is the custodian of the holy shrines, which are visited by Moslems as one of the five pillars of their faith. Under the rule of the late <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the Iranian pilgrims tried to turn the <LOCATION> Hajj </LOCATION> into a political forum to spread his Islamic fundamentalist teachings. The worst incidents occurred in the pilgrimage of 1987, when the Iranian contingent clashed with Saudi security forces, leading to the death of 402 pilgrims, most of them Iranians. <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> severed ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> the following April and gained the Moslem's world backing for restricting the number of pilgrims to 1,000 people for each 1 million people of the sending nation's population The Iranians boycotted the Hajj in 1988 and 1989 as a result and there was a fierce war of words between <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, however, has moved recently to improve ties with Gulf Arab nations including <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. A `` pragmatic'' camp in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, headed by President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, is trying to open <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> more to the outside world. It is opposed by radicals who view links with the pro-Western Saudi rulers as anathema. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> itself has been a target of several acts of terrorism for which responsibility was laid on <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. These acts included an attempt on the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> ruler, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON> in 1985, and two years earlier the bomb blasts on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in which five people were killed and 86 injured. All these acts were also carried out by activists among <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s Shiite Moslem minority, many of them identified as members of the anti-Iraqi underground <PERSON> Daawa </PERSON> party The Shiites in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> are mainly members of families that came from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for livelihood in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>.

 Passengers aboard a <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> jet that crashed into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> said they were surprised when they landed in the water after sliding down chutes from the plane, and clung to driftwood until being rescued. `` Everyone was saying, ` Get out! Get out! Get out!' So we started helping each other get out,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a social worker from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> who was on the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 with his wife, <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON>. `` They told us to get of the plane and go out the door. I thought we were going to go down the slide and onto the runway. When we got off the slide we were in the water.'' Flight 5050, from <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, was carrying 63 people when it skidded off a runway into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, killing two people, the airline said. `` It was n't a violent crash,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` We went out the emergency exit. There was some driftwood'' in the water that several people clung to. He said police came by in a boat and picked them up. `` We were just hanging on to each other. We decided the only thing to do was to be calm.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON>, a CBS News producer who was on the flight, said via a cellular telephone that the engines apparently were cut halfway down the runway and went into reverse thrust. `` At that time no one thought there was going to be real trouble,'' he said. `` The pilot seemed to be accelerating but did n't have enough power to get the plane up,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said as he and his wife huddled in blankets inside an airport terminal. `` And it seemed something happened and he put on the brakes,'' he said. `` The plane took a dip and the next thing I knew all hell broke loose.'' <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON> said he managed to get out onto a wing, where he waited with several other people to be rescued. `` A lot of women and children were screaming that they could n't swim, they could n't swim,'' he said `` Most people were pretty calm after we got out onto the wing of the plane,'' he said. `` And they waited for boats to come pick us up and the rescuers also arrived and I have to say they did a pretty good job of keeping everybody calm and getting them safely off.'' Some people were trapped in the tail section of the plane, he said, and rescuers and crewmembers tried to keep them calm. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON>, a fire department scuba diver, said it took him about 45 minutes using a metal cutter to rescue one woman trapped in the tail section between collapsed seats, behind a woman who had died. `` Water started coming into the tail section,'' he said. `` When we started it was at 6 inches and when we finished there was 3 feet. And it -LRB- the fuselage -RRB- was rocking.'' He said firefighters placed the unidentified woman, who was not seriously injured, into a basket and took her to a boat. `` She hugged us, kissed us. She wanted to know our names. She thanked us a million times,'' <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said a stranger helped him after they hit the water. `` I started to panic,'' he said. `` There was a guy. ... He grabbed me, he maneuvered me over to the driftwood. If it was n't there I do n't know what would have happened.

But we were able to stabilize him, and I do n't think he'll die within the next 24 hours,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacasaid </PERSON> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> was in `` serious but stable'' condition Wednesday, the doctor said, but `` Even so, he probably will not recover from this crisis.'' <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, 63, led this country for five years until he stepped down June 1 and was <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s staunchest ally in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. He handed power to elected successor <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. The cancer was diagnosed in June 1988 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Two-thirds of his stomach was removed and chemotherapy was applied to help slow the disease's advance.

<HEAD>Bush Rejects Coffee Quota Appeal From Colombia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is refusing a request by Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> to reinstate a one-year <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> coffee export that has been beneficial to Colombian farmers, the White House says. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s coffee earnings have slumped at the same time that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is seeking Barco's help in cracking down on cocaine exports. Colombian officials have suggested they will have an even harder time persuading hard-pressed <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> farmers to grow coffee instead of coca if coffee export prices continue to slip. Colombian coffee prices have fallen sharply since the 74-nation International Coffee Agreement -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> ICA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ to which both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> belonged _ collapsed in July after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pulled out in a dispute over prices with coffee-producing nations. The Agreement set quotas for member nations' exports aimed at supporting prices of beans at $ 1.20 per pound or more. Some Central American and others, supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, wanted larger quotas. After suspension of the quotas in early July, prices fell quickly to around 85 cents per pound, give or take a few pennies. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has said this will cost $ 500 million a year in export revenue. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, whose nation relies on coffee as a major source of export earnings, had appealed to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to reconsider the coffee decision and to support reinstating the quotas for at least one year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was ready to negotiate for a new quota system but was unwilling to adhere to the now-defunct agreement, presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s letter to <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> was one `` expressing appreciation of the importance of coffee to the economies of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and other developing countries.'' The letter, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> continued, `` expressed his -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s -RRB- disappointment that the members of the <ORGANIZATION> ICA </ORGANIZATION> were unable to settle ... two fundamental problems.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wanted an increase in export quotas for higher-quality coffees enjoyed by American consumers, and tough penalties against countries secretly selling coffee surpluses to Eastern Bloc nations at prices below those charged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expresses his confidence that a lasting solution which is acceptable to other major members and respects market trends can be found,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> businessman who bought <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s Christian theme park for $ 65 million says he is backing out of the deal because of conflicting claims to the land from an Indian tribe <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> on Wednesday said the claims have prevented him from getting title insurance on the 2,300-acre <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> park and that the dispute is an `` insurmountable barrier'' to closing the deal by the Sept. 30 deadline. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> bought the Christian theme park, resort and shopping complex in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> sale a year ago after the TV evangelical empire's collapse in the sex and money scandal that brought down <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. Title insurance protects a piece of property from conflicting claims. Title insurers have been unwilling to issue a policy, which Mernick needs to secure financing for the deal, because of a claim by the <ORGANIZATION> Catawba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> to 144,000 acres in northern <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> that include <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> sought a one-year extension of the closing to 1990 to obtain insurance, but the court and the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> creditors who stand to gain from the sale withheld a decision unless he opened his records and offered evidence that he had the financing to complete the deal. `` I was fully prepared to submit to such an examination,'' <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> said. But he said the <ORGANIZATION> Catawbas </ORGANIZATION>' claims `` appear to present at this time an insurmountable barrier to the closing of the original transaction.'' M.C. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, a trustee appointed by the court for now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministries, was notified Wednesday that <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> was backing out. `` Heritage <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> is still for sale,'' said <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Allman </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>. Any sale would still be subject to court approval. The claim filed in 1980 by the <ORGANIZATION> Catawba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> seeks to reclaim land they contend was illegally sold to the state in 1840. A date has not been set for the lawsuit, which apparently has halted other commercial development, including a $ 100 million mall. The $ 175 million theme park was developed by <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy in 1987. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is on trial in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, on charges of defrauding followers of nearly $ 4 million.

<HEAD>NATO Proposal Would Limit Military Maneuvers in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact would limit most military maneuvers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to 40,000 soldiers and 800 tanks under a proposal offered by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> today at <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> talks on conventional forces. The proposal, the first to limit European military maneuvers, was presented to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact delegates at the start of the latest round of the talks. Chief West German delegate <PERSON> Ruediger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartmann </PERSON> called the package the `` most comprehensive, most detailed and most ambitious arms control system that was ever worked out for conventional forces.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> offer expands on a proposal the West made July 13 based on a blueprint for deep reductions in arms and troops that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> unveiled at a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting in May. <PERSON> Hartmann </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> package provides all the negotiating material needed to reach an agreement on conventional arms next year. It proposes limiting the size of military maneuvers to 40,000 men and 800 tanks. One maneuver every two years would be allowed to exceed those limits. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> paper also requires each side to give 42 days notice when calling up more than 40,000 reservists and would impose ceilings on the number of tanks, artillery pieces and personnel carriers in active units. It is little changed from a package offered two weeks ago at the opening session of the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks on reducing conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. A dispute among <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members delayed its presentation. Seven <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> countries and 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members are taking part in the talks on conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which began in March and cover all of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> mountains. The measures proposed by the West today also provide for an extensive exchange of information as part of detailed verification, including routine inspections to see each side carries out pledged reductions and maintains agreed upon ceilings. Western allies are divided on this issue, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> seeking strict surveillance, and their European partners objecting to frequent inspections of their facilities by the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. Under the proposal, removal of equipment from monitored storage or units with a low level of readiness would be permitted only after prior notification. In its July proposal, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> suggested each alliance have no more than 5,700 combat aircraft and 1,900 combat helicopters. The July 13 initiative also would restrict any one country to 3,420 aircraft and 1,140 helicopter gunships. Heavy armaments cuts are recommended, with a suggested ceiling of 20,000 main battle tanks, 16,500 artillery pieces and 28,000 armored personnel carriers for each side. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> also is proposing that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops stationed outside their national territory in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> not exceed 275,000 each. Diplomats for East and West are optimistic that preliminary agreements can be reached next year and implemented by 1992 or 1993. Negotiators have said the biggest problem in the current six-week round of talks is weapons categories. The most serious differences exist in aircraft. The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> pact, while not presenting specific figures, insists `` air defense interceptors'' based near <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the Urals be excluded. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> objects. Western experts have expressed concern that defensive aircraft could be reconstructed for strike capabilities. The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact has not yet responded to the West's July proposal, but in March proposed reducing six kinds of weapons, including aircraft, by 10 to 15 percent by 1994. That would be followed by a further 25 percent cut by 1997, with the ultimate goal of purely defensive forces by the year 2000.

 Aviation officials questioned crew members and recovered flight recorders today in an effort to learn why a <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> jet carrying 63 people aborted takeoff and skidded into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, killing two passengers. About 10 people were rescued clinging to driftwood, while others huddled on the wing of the 9-month-old <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 that broke apart late Wednesday at the water's edge at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` We just grabbed on to a big piece of wood and held on for dear life,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberry </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. This morning, the plane's data and cockpit voice recorders were recovered, <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON> said. Officials from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> arrived and began talking to the crew. `` Something happened and he put on the brakes. The plane took a dip and the next thing I knew all hell broke loose,'' said passenger <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, who huddled in blankets with his wife, <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON>. `` People were on top of each other. People were screaming. There was the smell of gas. Everyone was saying ` Get out! Get out! Get out!''' he said. The <PERSON> Martins </PERSON> got out, and held fast to driftwood until a police boat plucked them from the water. Officials said two women who had seats in the rear of the plane near where the fuselage snapped were killed. Their bodies were taken from the cabin; the cause of death was not immediately known. Forty-five people were taken to the hospital; two were reported in serious condition and a third was in stable condition after a heart attack. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said overnight that up to six people were missing and divers were sent to look for them. But an airline spokeswoman, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, said all 57 passengers and six crew members were accounted for as of 8 a.m. Flight 5050, bound for <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, originally scheduled for departure at 7:27 p.m., was delayed by heavy rain. But officials said weather was not a factor in the 11:29 p.m. crash. The plane split into three pieces, its nose remaining above water on a pier that holds runway approach lights. The other pieces were partly submerged in 25 - to 40-foot-deep water, just beyond a runway that extended onto pylons 10 feet above the water A crane raised the wreckage at dawn. `` What held it up was a lighting bridge,'' Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said of the front section. `` The back section, God held that up.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the airport, said several people walked away from the crash, and at least one took a taxi home. Some survivors crawled onto the wing to await rescue. Others _ some shoeless _ slid out exits into the water. At least one person was cut from the wreckage. `` They were hanging from the pier, hanging on the wing, hanging from the front of the plane,'' said police Lt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>. The airport reopened this morning after six hours. The plane was delivered new to <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> in January and had no history of mechanical problems, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. Coast Guard Lt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Blisard </PERSON> said most of the passengers were saved because the water was not cold, the plane went down close to the lighted runway and the impact was not harsh. He said the only problem was a strong current. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON>, a CBS News producer who was on the plane, said he moved toward the back and got out onto a wing. `` A lot of women and children were screaming that they could n't swim, they could n't swim,'' <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON> said Coast Guard boats and planes, police vehicles, a cherry picker and divers responded. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said he helped a few passengers. `` A couple people could n't swim so we got them on the driftwood,'' he said. `` It was a kind of ` row, row, row your boat.' It was kind of funny, but not really. You ca n't think about what can happen here.'' The plane's engines apparently cut off halfway down the runway and went into reverse thrust, <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON> said. `` At that time no one thought there was going to be real trouble,'' he told CBS via cellular telephone. `` Most people were pretty calm after we got out onto the wing of the plane,'' he said. `` And they waited for boats to come pick us up and the rescuers also arrived and I have to say they did a pretty good job of keeping everybody calm and getting them safely off.''

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ten bombs exploded early today in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, causing heavy damage to nine offices of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s main political parties and to one bank, police said. At least two people were reported injured. Bombings have occurred almost daily since the government declared a crackdown on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s powerful cocaine traffickers on Aug. 18. The explosions came hours after lawmakers urged the government to publicize reported `` black lists'' of corrupt politicians and officials. Colombian newspapers today published the names of 25 lawmakers and politicians, including a <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate, who the papers said had their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visas denied or canceled. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Urutia </PERSON> today said he did not know if the visas were withheld because of links with traffickers. He refused further comment. Police said the bombs went off around 3 a.m. They damaged offices of the Liberals and Conservatives, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s two main political parties, in several neighborhoods of the capital of 6 million people. Another blast ripped through a bank. Banks have been a favorite target of the cocaine cartels. Police said the two injured people were taken to hospitals. There were no other details immediately available. `` This shows the total decadence we are living in in this country. It's a senseless war,'' said <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barguch </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He said one blast destroyed national party headquarters. <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> mayor, called for an emergency meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to discuss additional security measures. <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Santofimio </PERSON> <PERSON> Botero </PERSON> said today his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visa was canceled in March in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> because he met <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel leader <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> eight years ago, when both were congressmen. `` I barely knew him and met him only during a political rally,'' the Liberal politician told <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>, a private radio chain. He accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of retaliating for his criticism of `` American intervention in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> asked the government for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> list with names of politicians denied visas because of suspected drug connections. It also passed a resolution urging the government to make public other lists with names of politicians and government leaders alleged to have links with the cartels. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> has said he's not aware of any such lists. Also Wednesday, the head of the country's criminal investigation office said <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> mercenaries smuggled weapons through <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to train assassination squads for drug cartels, teaching them tactics used in political killings and bombings. Gen. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Maza </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that the mercenaries, working for the drug cartels since 1987, `` ca n't escape responsibility'' for the bank bombings and political assassinations. The slaying Aug. 18 of Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, a popular presidential candidate and anti-drug crusader, led to the government crackdown. As part of the crackdown, President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> revived <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where the top traffickers are wanted. So far, one person has been extradited, but the drug barons on the nation's most-wanted list have eluded capture. <PERSON> Maza </PERSON> said foreign military trainers smuggled weapons from neighboring <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to train four paramilitary groups. Squads of 50 to 80 men each received up to four months of training, <PERSON> Maza </PERSON> said. He said at least nine Israelis trained the squads. It's unknown how many British mercenaries were involved, but the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged trainers were in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maza </PERSON> said his information was based in `` intelligence investigations,'' but he charged that many in the military and government, in an attempt to discredit him, and have been slow to act on his reports. <PERSON> Maza </PERSON>, who has had at least four recent attempts on his life, headed the investigation that led to the government issuing an arrest warrant Monday for <PERSON> Yair </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a former Israeli army colonel accused of training paramilitary squads for drug cartels. Mercenary training for both the <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartels consisted of supplying weapons and martial arts and explosives training, <PERSON> Maza </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Committee Proposes Streamlining of Death Penaly Appeals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A special committee today proposed streamlining death penalty appeals to assure swifter executions but only after guaranteeing condemned prisoners competent legal help. `` Capital cases should be subject to one complete and fair course of collateral review in the state and federal system,'' said the panel appointed by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>. `` When this review has concluded, litigation should end.'' Retired Supreme Court Justice <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the committee chairman, said the current system encourages endless delays, repetitive appeals and frenzied, last-minute activity as death row inmates approach scheduled executions. `` The hard fact is that the laws of 37 states -LRB- that have the death penalty -RRB- are not being enforced by the courts,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` I respect those who argue for outright abolition of death punishment. But it seems irrational to retain the penalty and frustrate its fair implementation.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> noted that there are some 2,200 death row inmates but there have been only 118 executions since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reinstated the death penalty in 1972. He said the average delay between conviction and execution is more than eight years and the longest has been 14 -LCB- years. `` Delay of this magnitude is hardly necessary for fairness or for thorough review,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. The committee he heads recommended that states enact laws to assure that death row inmates have adequate legal help throughout their appeals at taxpayer expense. The committee did not estimate the potential cost or the likely reduction in time between convictions and executions. If the state chose not to adopt the plan, the current system would remain in effect for that state _ permitting repetitive state and federal court appeals. One feature of the new system would be a six-month period to file a federal appeal after the prisoner exhausts state appeals. There is no such time period now. The current system permits death row inmates to file repeated appeals to federal courts to challenge alleged violations of their constitutional rights. Under the committee's proposal, there would be one round of such federal appeals unless condemned prisoners could produce new evidence to demonstrate innocence.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> called today for strong Western support for Soviet economic and political reforms, saying they are in the interest of liberty. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for an international conference of conservative parties, also said she is confident that trade issues raised in meetings with Japanese leaders and business executives will be resolved satisfactorily. The <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> leader has frankly criticized what she called <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s unfair trade barriers and urged fast action to open its markets to foreign goods In a meeting with former Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and later in comments to reporters, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> stressed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s responsibility to contribute to global economic growth and called for stronger support for reforms spearheaded by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` This is the most bold and courageous leader the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has had while it's been under Communism. What Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is attempting to do ... is in the interests of liberty as a whole and in the interest of all other nations who believe in the cause of democracy as well. `` We should do, therefore, everything we can to support this great, historic movement ... and do all we can to see that it is successful.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> when she leaves <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Friday. She noted a trend in favor of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> democratic political and economic views but cautioned against relaxing defenses, predicting a period of instability in East-West relations and elsewhere. `` A time of great uncertainty is no time to reduce your defenses,'' she said. `` You do n't prevent wars by disarmament. You prevent wars by quietly being prepared and having a sure defense.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> pointed to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as an area where unexpected political developments had created great uncertainty, and she urged <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to provide increased investment and support to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Confidence in the future of that British colony, which reverts to Chinese rule in 1997, was shaken severely by <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s military assault on pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in June and an ensuing crackdown on political dissent. `` It is absolutely vital we should do everything we can to keep up the confidence of the people in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who arrived Tuesday in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to attend a conference of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a grouping of right-of-center political parties, called her visit `` timely.'' `` With so many changes taking place in the world, it is very important that the great democracies, and particularly the economic summit seven countries, should consult very closely with each other,'' she said. She said she hoped to create an `` unprecedented partnership'' with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the 1990s and to resolve lingering trade problems.

<HEAD>Dukakis Signs Law Requiring Judges to Explain Lenient Sentences</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Judges wo n't be able to let violent criminals off without prison unless they explain their sentences in writing under a new state law. Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who signed the legislation Wednesday along with a bill increasing aid to victims of violent crime, acknowledged the law would probably lead to more crowded prisons. But he said he is committed to expanding prison space. `` If a judge is not going to sentence someone to prison for a crime of violence, he should have very good reasons _ reasons that will hold up to public scrutiny,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We're going to expect judges in this state to be accountable.'' Judges `` are fallible and make mistakes occasionally,'' he said, adding that that would be much less likely to happen under the new law because judges will be forced to think carefully about their rulings. Chief Justice <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Liacos </PERSON> said through a spokeswoman that he is n't against the concept but is worried it will require more work of judges without providing extra staff. The other bill signed by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at least doubles the fine imposed on criminals to help victims. A sponsor said the legislation would raise $ 5 million a year for services such as translation and counseling as well as $ 1.5 million toward direct compensation to victims.

<HEAD>Lake Stakes Claim to Only Remaining Horse Ferry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The only known horse ferry left in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will be preserved at its underwater location in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Champlain </LOCATION>, where divers will be allowed to examine it and take photographs. `` Just as we're protecting the natural beauty of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Champlain </LOCATION>, what today's event marks is the protecting of the historic resources,'' said <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON>, who dedicated the wreck Wednesday along with state and local officials, historians and representatives of the diving community. The horse-powered ferry, which cruised 150 years ago, and three other shipwrecks are marked with surface buoys and underwater signs that encourage divers to look but keep the wreck intact. A bright yellow sign placed on the horse ferry advises divers to `` take nothing but photos.'' The horse ferry, or `` teamboat,'' was powered by two horses or mules who walked on a large turntable mounted beneath the deck. The turntable drove a pair of paddle wheels that allowed the ferry to travel the lake between <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. The identity and date of the boat are still unknown, but it most likely cruised the lake in the first half of the 19th century. The design is based on an 1819 patent, and the <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> granted the first teamboat charter on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Champlain </LOCATION> in 1821. The last teamboat was retired around the time of the Civil War. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Crisman </PERSON>, a marine archaeologist who is documenting the wreck, said the two-horsepower boat would have been heard several miles away, `` with the horses' hooves clumping on the deck and the iron gears clanking.'' Today its remains are in 45 feet of water less than a mile northwest of the <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> breakwater. It is 63 feet long and 23 feet wide, and is extremely fragile, said <PERSON> Giovanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Peebles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> state archaeologist. Divers can see the algae-covered wreck from five to 15 feet away. <PERSON> Crisman </PERSON> said the most spectacular part is the paddle wheels, with the iron hubs and oak spokes still complete, although badly deteriorated, rising 10 feet above the bottom.

<HEAD>NATO Presents New Proposals to Curb Threat of War in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday offered the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact sweeping new proposals for reducing the threat of war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and senior Western negotiators expressed confidence agreement could be reached by next year. The proposals would regulate exchange of information on numbers and locations of forces and weapons systems of the two military pacts over a zone stretching west from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> mountains in the east. Western delegation heads said their new presentation at the talks on Conventional Armed Forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> completed initial <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> concepts on curbing the possibility of non-nuclear war on the continent. In earlier proposals, the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> suggested weapons ceilings on arms categories including combat aircraft and helicopters, and the scrapping of all withdrawn equipment. Chief West German delegate <PERSON> Ruediger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartmann </PERSON> called the total <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> package the `` most comprehensive, most detailed and most ambitious arms control system that was ever worked out for conventional forces.'' His Canadian counterpart, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Peel </PERSON>, told reporters, `` Now that our package is there ... I think chances of our reaching agreement next year are extremely good.'' Reflecting <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> confidence of quick progress, chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> said the alliance was planning to present a draft treaty possibly before the current round of talks ends Oct. 19. The talks resume Nov. 10. The new, 13-page, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> initiative includes the following proposals: _ Exchange of detailed information on combat and support units and air defenses to the squadron or batallion level _ Providing the numbers and locations of main battle tanks, artillery pieces, armored troop carriers, combat aircraft and combat helicopters, as well as <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> arms depots and their <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact equivalents _ Information on the number and location of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops in allied European countries _ Advance notification of major changes in force organization and strength, mobilization of reservists if they number 42,000 or more, and of major movements of main battle tanks, artillery and armored troop carriers _ Limits on the numbers of main battle tanks, artillery and troop carriers in storage _ No more than one military excercise every two years mobilizing more than 40,000 troops or 800 main battle tanks _ Inspection of designated bases and depots and the right to ask for inspection of non-designated ones; requests to look at non-designated bases and depots may be refused _ Monitoring of the destruction of withdrawn equipment A <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact negotiator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said in an interview that the new proposals `` showed promise'' but that it was too early for substantive comment. The seven-nation <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact still has to formally respond to a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> initiative presented in July. That initiative incorporated proposals made in May by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, including capping the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troop strengths at 275,000 each and slashing the number of military aircraft. While acknowledging general superiority in numbers, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact disputes the accuracy of specific <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> statistics on personnel and weapons. According to November 1988 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> statistics, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and its allies have 3,090,000 men in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared to 2,213,593 for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>; 51,500 main battle tanks to 16,424 for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>; 22,400 armored infantry fighting vehicles to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s 4,153; 43,400 artillery pieces to 14,458 in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>; and 8,250 combat aircraft to 3,977 for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>.

 Hurricane Hugo's leading edge brought rain to the lower <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> today, and thousands fled inland. The first of 1,000 soldiers sent by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> to quell looting in the storm's wake. With landfall expected as early as tonight between <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and the killer storm's winds rising to 110 mph, schools were closed, homes were boarded up, residents stocked up on emergency supplies and shelters opened. Forecasters warned that waves could tower as much as 16 feet above normal because the hurricane could cross the coast at high tide, about 2:30 a.m. Rain of 5 to 10 inches was forecast. The military brought aircraft inland and sent ships out to sea to ride out the storm, which has killed at least 25 people in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> with direct blows to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s governor declared an emergency and called out the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to help thousands move inland. As many as 490,000 people were being evacuated from the coast in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, where an emergency also was declared. `` We get a lot of storms over here. I do n't get real upset over them because I've sat through too many of them,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Treadaway </PERSON>, who was packing this morning to leave <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, taping the windows of her <LOCATION> Wrightsville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, gas station, said residents of the island town were nervous. `` <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, back in 1984, was nothing really to worry about,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>. `` This one's expected to be bigger. ... It's still exciting, as long as you're safe.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military police were sent to the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> to reinforce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and armed <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> who were dispatched after police reportedly joined prison escapees and machete-armed mobs in looting on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>. The first contingent, about 75 soldiers led by a brigadier general, arrived this morning, secured the airport and set up a command center. It appeared to be the first time in more than 20 years that a president ordered active duty military personnel into the nation's streets. `` Everyone in the federal pen there is loose,'' said <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> advertising executive who was among 145 <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> tourists who arrived in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> late Wednesday on a government-arranged evacuation flight. `` There are murderers and snipers running around everywhere,'' she said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also declared the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> a disaster area and freed up $ 500,000 for relief. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> sideswiped the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and accelerated as it moved over open water Wednesday. `` An increase in forward speed increases the likelihood that it will strike the coast and not recurve, heading out to sea,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Early today, rain from <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> fell from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. Rain was heavy around <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. A hurricane warning was issued from <LOCATION> Fernandina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lookout </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION> Forecasters said there was a 1 in 4 chance that it would come ashore between <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> officials braced for widespread flooding, noting that some streets flood at high tide during a full moon even without a storm. Hospitals stockpiled supplies, discharged patients well enough to go home and moved others inland. Utility companies said they would cut off power to <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> decided it was safe to keep shuttle Atlantis on the launch pad for an October launch. At noon EDT, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s center was 305 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, or 29.5 degrees north latitude and 77 degrees west longitude. It was moving northwest at 17 mph, up from 12 mph Wednesday. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clack </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said he expected 490,000 people would be evacuated from the state's barrier islands and other low-lying areas. From <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>, people stocked up on supplies to board up windows and carry them through several days without electricity and water. `` They're buying me out of all my candles, tape, flashlights, propane fuel, oil and lamps,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brindley </PERSON>, manager of a K mart in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION>, S.C. The governor requested shelters opened in eight coastal counties. His emergency declaration put the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and state law enforcement agencies on alert and ordered vans to be made available to evacuate the elderly. In <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, the 188-year-old City Hall was boarded up, schools and colleges canceled class and the mayor said the storm could be the city's biggest catastrophe since a 1938 tornado that killed 32 people and injured hundreds. `` It's very important no one underestimate the danger of this hurricane,'' Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sent its ships from <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> to ride out the storm. <ORGANIZATION> Hunter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> flew more than 60 helicopters inland. Bases in <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> also planned to fly aircraft away from the storm. Tropical Storm Iris was close behind. At 6 a.m. EDT, it was near 22.7 north latitude and 66.2 west longitude, or 330 miles east of <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Winds were 45 mph as the storm moved west-northwest at about 13 mph. The last major storm to blow ashore in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION> in 1959, which struck near <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> with winds of more than 100 mph, leaving 22 dead and $ 14 million in damage.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today won the support of former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> for spending $ 9 million to aid the anti-Sandinista opposition in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s elections next year as a way to `` make the playing field level.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freely </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elected </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heads </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> will lead an observer delegation to the Nicaraguan elections, said as long as the money is used in accordance with Nicaraguan law, it will benefit the political process. He spoke with reporters after meeting with the president. The Nicaraguan election law requires that half of any money coming into the political process from outside the country be given to the country's electoral council that runs the elections. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> reiterated his opinion that indications are the elections will be fair, although some in the administration remain wary of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' sincerity. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was expected to send a formal request for the aid to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> as early as today, according to congressional sources. The aid is intended to help long shot opposition candidate <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> get a fairer shot in the presidential election scheduled for February. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has been sounding out prospects for the measure with congressional leaders, and one <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> source who spoke on condition of anonymity said responses had been encouraging. Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., a critic of past administration efforts to aid opponents of the leftist <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> regime, said late Wednesday his initial reaction to the package was favorable The money _ to be funneled both directly to the opposition political coalition and indirectly through the quasi-governmental <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> election observers _ would meet an estimated 80 percent or more of <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> election budget, according to administration estimates. The endowment is a private foundation created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 to support democratic elections worldwide, using money appropriated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Proponents of the aid package said the administration believes it would lend credibility to the opposition and make it easier for <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>'s coalition to raise additional money from other countries and individuals. It also would help level the playing field for the fledgling opposition coalition against the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, which has held power since a 1979 revolution. Administration officials and many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> believe the elections, while an uphill battle for the opposition, offer the best opportunity in a decade to oust the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, who are closely linked to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Most of the aid, some $ 5 million, would go to NED for use in non-partisan efforts at voter registration, voter turnout and election organizing, said sources in both parties and both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity. The administration believes those efforts can be at least indirectly helpful to <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, the publisher of the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> and the candidate of the opposition coalition known as <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION>. The move would require no change in NED's charter, which prohibits direct partisan political activities. Another $ 2 million would go directly to <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION>, but under Nicaraguan law would have to be split 50-50 with the country's electoral commission, which will run the elections. The remaining $ 2 million would help fund the activities of election observer groups such as one to be sent by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the sources said. In visits to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week, <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION> representatives asked for overt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid for `` the electoral process'' in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, despite what they said was the certainty that the Sandinistas would seek to use <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> support as a propaganda weapon against them. Earlier this month, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had considered asking for $ 3 million for an open, direct donation to <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>'s campaign, but modified that approach in the face of congressional opposition.

 Residents of this popular American vacation resort toted guns as they waited for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military police to arrive after widespread looting during Hurricane Hugo. The first contingent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops sent to restore calm to the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> arrived in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> today and moved immediately to secure the airfield and `` deploy troops as necessary,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today that the troops have been given rifles and have been ordered to shoot if necessary to defend themselves. `` Keep out or you will be shot,'' read a sign outside an electronics store in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> that already was stripped of its merchandise Wednesday. At one shopping center, armed guards stood on rooftops to ward off looters. But at another, people wandered freely from store to store, loading up with shoes, clothes and bicycle tires. `` Everybody else is taking it. Why should n't we?'' said <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> as she stood with her two young daughters beside a grocery cart loaded with clothes and shoes. `` Most of our clothes got wet,'' said her husband, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>. People were taking damaged goods that merchants wanted to get rid of anyway, he said. <PERSON> Shaher </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON>, owner of a ravaged furniture store, disagreed. `` We did n't expect the public to do this to us,'' he said as his 15-year-old son, <PERSON> Saker </PERSON>, stood nearby with a pistol. `` They have something bad in the heart.'' Several residents said local <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> troops had joined in the looting, but the guard's commander denied the charge. `` The National Guard trucks are being used to transport food supplies,'' said Adjutant Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moorehead </PERSON>. `` People see that and they assume the worst.'' A few National Guard members directed traffic; none was seen where stores were looted. On the island of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> said some looting occurred but that `` there is no near state of anarchy.'' He said preliminarly reports indicated no one was killed in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> during the storm. No injuries were reported during the looting spree. <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, a resident, said prisoners had been released from jail because the building was damaged and no one was there to guard them. `` I ran into a guy on the street yesterday who was a convicted murderer,'' she said. Amid the lawlessness, there were some acts of charity. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Lobo </PERSON> said he helped a friend who owns a restaurant hand out food. Dr. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tejo </PERSON> worked quietly to clean up his one-story frame house that was flattened by the storm. He and his wife, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, moved into the basement laundry room and tool shop. `` I'm going to rebuild this with cement walls and a cement floor so this wo n't happen again,'' <PERSON> Tejo </PERSON> said as he looked through the rubble. <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tejo </PERSON>, who was born a few months before the island's last major hurricane in 1928, said they never thought of leaving <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>. `` I have gone through a lot, and I am not leaving,'' she said. `` We have survived.'' The island remained without water, power and telephone service, and officials said it could take a month or more to restore the utilities. Trees and downed power lines littered the highways. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> blew the roof off nearly every building on the island when it struck Monday. Wrecked boats were piled on top of each other in a waterfront street. The storm stripped the island's trees, leaving a barren, brown landscape. `` An atom bomb hit <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redfield </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, a territorial senator. `` No community could be prepared for this kind of disaster.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday used the cutter Bear to begin evacuating residents and tourists. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said today that 100 people had requested evacuation on their vessels, and a weather research vessel in <LOCATION> Christiansted </LOCATION> harbor took 200 people aboard who wanted to leave. About 145 St. Croix tourists arrived in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> late Thursday on an evacuation flight arranged by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals. Several tourists who remained on the island said they were being protected by armed hotel employees but were anxious to leave nonetheless. `` I'll sit anywhere,'' said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertzog </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` I do n't care if they put me in one of those transports.'' <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> still could manage to joke about their ruined honeymoon as they waited for a ride off the island. `` It's been a stormy relationship before, but this is ridiculous,'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three men armed with AK-47 rifles opened fire Thursday on a Sunni Moslem member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, killing him and his driver and injuring two passers-by, police said. Across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and surrounding mountains, Syrian forces and gunners loyal to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leader, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, dueled with mortars and tank cannons. Police said at least one person was killed and six wounded, raising the overall toll to 927 killed and 2,731 wounded since the latest round of fighting broke out March 8. The attack on <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Nazim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadri </PERSON> occurred as the 74-year-old politician entered his car outside his home in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> at about 10:20 a.m., according to witnesses. A police spokesman said <PERSON> Kadri </PERSON> and his police driver, Sgt. <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON>, were killed instantly and two pedestrians were injured, one seriously, in the shooting. One witness said the killers jumped out of a red car parked behind <PERSON> Kadri </PERSON>'s. `` The gunmen called <PERSON> Kadri </PERSON> by name, the deputy looked at them,'' the witness said, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` Two gunmen opened fire. <PERSON> Kadri </PERSON>'s driver drew his pistol, but another gunman took several shots at him from an automatic rifle before he managed to open fire.'' The witness said the killers sped away, shooting into the air. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. An official obituary released by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s public relations department said <PERSON> Kadri </PERSON> was first elected as a representative for the central <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in the one-chamber house in 1951. The former lawyer was `` repeatedly elected'' until 1972 when the latest parliamentary elections were held. The civil war, which broke out in 1975, has prevented further elections. <PERSON> Kadri </PERSON>'s assassination brought to 73 the number of surviving deputies in the 99-seat Parliament. Twenty-five have died and the seat of former President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> became vacant when he was elected head of state in 1982. The latest violence occurred as an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee tried to enforce a cease-fire call. Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> told the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Qabas that the peace plan issued last week by the three-man committee was `` inadequate.'' He demanded guarantees that arms supplies to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> would be cut off. <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> said that without guarantees of a halt of weapons to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, the plan would amount to no more than a `` mere truce.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> receives weapons from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, a bitter rival of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 mandate to quell the civil war. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> says <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> violated the mandate by siding with the Moslems in the civil war, and he has vowed to drive them out. The latest violence broke out after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> in March imposed a blockade of ports run by Moslem militias. The Syrians responded by shelling the Christian enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, home to about 1 million Christians.

 From an armed landing party in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> to a station 15 yards from the churning waters off <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has moved to the battlefront of Hurricane Hugo preparation and recovery. `` We're a small service -LRB- but -RRB- over the years, we've learned to be very adept in applying our resources,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>. As the storm bore down on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, shut down the Intracoastal Waterway and nearby rivers to commercial vessels and advised private boaters to stay put or move upstream `` We've given out warnings over the radios and televisions saying please do not sail at this time due to the hurricane,'' said seaman apprentice <PERSON> Iain </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, who said rescuers would venture out only if lives were endangered. `` If there is a boat that's just drifting, basically forget it.

And in an extraordinary move, an armed <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> contingent went ashore Thursday in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> after law and order collapsed. `` We were the maritime agency that was in the area,'' <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON> said Thursday. `` We have maritime and peacetime missions, but we're still a military service and we still have to maintain our military readiness.'' Six cutters remained in the area Thursday to evacuate anyone who wanted off <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> while others stood by to help as needed as <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> churned toward the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coast. The modern <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, but its history of law enforcement dates to 1867 when its predecessor, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cutter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, was the only police agency for the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> territory. The Coast Guard has seen active duty as part of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War, often escorting convoys and operating landing crafts. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is probably best known for its search and rescue efforts in modern times, it is deeply involved in the drug war. Its cutters have fired on 18 vessels as part of its drug interception duties. `` You have to be prepared to be ready to use and deploy the ship in any kind of operation,'' <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON> said. `` The cutters are equipped with the necessary armaments to carry out their mission.'' Both the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Caribbean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> units are part of the <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` There's quite a bit of tug of war going on in the 7th right now. She's getting pulled from about six different directions,'' <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON> said. `` If need be, we will have resources moving in from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.''

 A high school's war on drugs turned violent when an angry mother socked the prinicpal in the jaw for calling police to question her son.

 Mothers of drug-addicted babies are being offered a chance to get treatment as an alternative to prosecution, but some critics said the program would unfairly force women into treatment. `` They go into the program. They successfully complete the program. They will not have criminal charges arising out of this,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeown </PERSON>, the assistant state attorney coordinating the program. Charges have been postponed against about 40 women because they may be eligible for the 18-month residential treatment program, prosecutors say. `` I really think the traditional means of prosecution are not going to accomplish what needs to be accomplished,'' she said. But the experimental program also is raising an ethical and legal controversy. `` Effectively, it's involuntarily committing someone,'' said <PERSON> Robyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumner </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>. `` What you're basically saying is, ` Look, you have a choice, addicted mother. You can either go to treatment or go to trial, and either way, you're a loser.''' Opponents question whether courts will uphold the convictions of women charged with getting their infants addicted to drugs. Some critics say it will force women into treatment even though they have n't been convicted of crimes. However, prosecutors and other supporters called it an innovative way to deal with a complex social problem.

 A school bus was hit from behind by a delivery truck and plunged into a watery gravel pit this morning, authorities said. At least 18 youngsters were reported killed and 49 other people injured. Divers pulled several bodies from the 12 feet of murky water covering the bus, which was carrying students to junior and senior high schools in Mission when it fell on its side into the 40 - to 45-foot hole, authorities said `` They were just trapped. We had to break the glass of the windows to get in,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON>, a scuba diver who said he pulled seven bodies out. <PERSON> Nye </PERSON>, who was driving his children to school at the time of the accident, said, `` You could n't see at all in there.'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, said at least 18 people, ages 12 to 18, were killed in the 7:40 a.m. accident, which occurred in clear, dry weather near the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> border about 75 miles from <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>. Rescuers used a crane to lift the bus from the water but divers continued searching at midday for any more victims. The number of people aboard the 70-seat bus was not immediately known. The bus driver and the truck driver were being treated at hospitals, authorities said. Their conditions were not known. The owner of the unfenced pit alongside the road was not immediately known. `` We're going crazy here,'' said firefighter <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>. The youngsters' parents `` are very hysterical. They have really lost control, some of them.'' <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said it was the worst school bus accident in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> history. The two worst such accidents in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history occurred in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Continued Ban on Electronic Courtroom Coverage Urged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal courts' policy-making arm is being urged to continue banning all television, radio and photographic coverage of courtroom proceedings, a spokesman said Thursday. A five-judge committee told the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Judicial Conference this week that `` circumstances have not changed so drastically'' in recent years to justify relaxing the ban, said conference spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sellers </PERSON>. The 28-judge conference, headed by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, in 1984 rejected a request by news organizations that the longtime ban on electronic and photographic coverage in federal courts be lifted. Today, 44 states allow such coverage in their courts at either the trial or appellate level, or both. In its report to the conference, the five-judge committee recommended that `` technological advances and the experiences of the states continue to be monitored to determine whether further modifications of the restrictions would be warranted at a future date.'' But one of the committee members, federal appellate Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, voted to end the blanket ban. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a member of the Denver-based 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, said each federal court should be free to allow electronic and photographic coverage to the same extent allowed by state courts in the same state. <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> has said he is n't unalterably opposed to allowing television and radio coverage of federal courts, including the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` If I were convinced that coverage by television of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> would not disrupt the way the court works I would give it sympathetic consideration,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> three years ago. But the chief justice has told reporters that a majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s nine members opposes such an innovation. Federal court rules permit electronic and photographic coverage of various ceremonial courtroom proceedings, and allow use of such equipment for presenting evidence and making an official court record. The committee report recommended that federal marshals be allowed to use electronic equipment to monitor courtrooms for security reasons. It also recommended that judges be given more flexible authority to permit use of electronic equipment `` for other purposes of judicial administration.'' The report was authored by the committee's chairman, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Peckham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>GNP Grows 2.5 Percent in 2nd Quarter; Outlook Described as `Pretty'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The economy grew at a moderate 2.5 percent pace in the second quarter, the government said Thursday, down somewhat from the first quarter but strong enough to stop any new predictions of imminent recession. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that April-June growth in the gross national product compared with a 3.7 percent gain in the first three months. The second-quarter GNP had been revised downward 0.2 percentage point from the 2.7 percent growth estimate a month ago. Nearly two-thirds of the January-March strength came from an anticipated rebound in farm output. Without the drought effect, growth actually was only 1.5 percent. `` The picture is a pretty one,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Not too much growth, not too little ... right on the nose for a ` soft-landing.''' `` The picture,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, `` is an economy that is continuing to climb, albeit at a subdued rate ... a laid-back pace, but that's really what the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> wants. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has moved for over a year to achieve a so-called `` soft-landing'' by dampening inflation by slowing the economy without driving it into a recession. Thus, analysts said, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> also should appreciate the downward revision in the GNP's April-June inflation rate. A price index tied to the GNP showed a 5 percent gain, rather than the 5.1 percent estimate a month ago. Since the April-June quarter, <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> noted, `` inflation has ebbed considerably.'' He said the second-quarter GNP rate `` is the worst inflation number we'll have for the year and for some time ahead, at least several quarters ahead.'' And he predicted `` we're likely to see more of the same on growth, perhaps a bit lower ... no more than what it has been in the second quarter and more likely less.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, which influences the economy by controlling monetary growth, `` will not be influenced by this report'' to reduce interest rates further at this time, <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said. `` In fact, had it known in June that the economy would have risen this much, it probably would not have reduced interest rates then.'' In a companion report, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said after-tax profits of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations fell 7.2 percent in the second quarter, a bigger decline that the 5.4 percent drop estimated a month ago. It was the second consecutive quarterly decline and, <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> said, `` shows that economic slowing is not without pain.'' The GNP is the nation's total output of goods and services and its broadest measure of economic growth. The downward revision in the second-quarter GNP reflected drops in earlier estimates of consumer and government spending. But consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of all economic activity, still increased a healthy 1.9 percent in the April-June quarter. At the same time, business investment spending advanced a strong 8.6 percent and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports grew 13.1 percent for the third straight quarter of double-digit growth. Housing, adversely affected by high interest rates, fell 12.3 percent. On an annual basis, the economy grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate during the first six months of the year. It will need to expand only at a 2.3 percent rate for the remainder of the year to match the administration's goal of 2.9 percent growth for all of 1989. The various changes left the GNP expanding in the second quarter at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 4.13 trillion.

 A CBS producer on his way to cover Hurricane Hugo helped two fellow passengers with small children escape a jet crash before going back into the wreckage to retrieve his cellular phone for a live broadcast. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON> was among 63 people aboard a <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> jet that aborted its takeoff from <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> late Wednesday and skidded into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, killing two women. `` My first instinct _ I'm no hero _ was to get out of there,'' he said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON> used a cellular phone he retrieved from the wreckage for live reports, first for network-owned WCBS-TV, then for a seven-minute CBS News special. A seven-year <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> employee, <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON>, 29, had planned to fly to <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, then to <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, to help cover Hurricane Hugo. He was sitting near the jetliner's front, which remained above water while other parts of the cracked fuselage were partly submerged. He saw a woman standing with a child farther back in the plane and helped them out of the wreckage. Then, he said, `` I went down toward the exits and I saw a woman holding a smaller infant ... and she was saying, ` I do n't know how to swim, I do n't know how to swim.' `` Until then, I did n't know we were in the water.'' He helped that woman and her child out onto a wing. `` I was just praying that we would n't go down and would n't have to make a choice of holding up the baby or the mother,'' he said. After they were clear of the torn fuselage, he said he thought, `` I need to let <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> know.'' He said he crawled back into the wreckage for his portable phone, which he had placed beneath his seat. `` The phone was pinned in between some seats, but I was able to twist it out,'' he said. `` Then I went back to the exit door because I did n't want the plane to start sinking with me on it. That's when I made the initial calls to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NewsNet </ORGANIZATION> and CBS News.'' The former, for which <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON> is an associate producer, feeds news stories and footage to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliates and CBS News. When he first called from the wreckage about five minutes after the crash, startled <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> staff members did n't believe him, he said. `` They said, ` Come on, you must be kidding, you're in a plane crash?' And I think a string of words that I do n't usually spout came out. I said, ` This call's for real.''' After rescue crews took him and the others from the wreckage, he said, he stood on a nearby pier and began live phone reports, including a special report with <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> at 12:33 a.m. EDT. <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Vermillion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, who has lived in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> for most of his life, went to TV studios Thursday for interviews on <ORGANIZATION> WCBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> and `` CBS This Morning'' rather than on to his original assignment. He said he planned `` to go home and get some rest,'' although it will be difficult. `` My adrenalin is telling me that I want to go down there and do that hurricane story,'' he said. `` But my back is telling me that I better take it easy. And my wife is telling me'' _ he began laughing _ `` that if my back does n't tell me to take it easy, she'll do it on some other part.''

<TEXT>
 A new federal tax law aimed at collecting unreported day-care income may thin the ranks of baby sitters and drive up the cost of child care, tax specialists and industry spokesmen say. The law requires parents to provide the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> with the name and Social Security number of their day-care provider if they want to deduct the cost on their federal income taxes. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> will check the cost reported by parents with the amount reported by baby sitters as the agency goes after an estimated $ 7 billion in day-care income that goes unreported each year. `` I do n't know that they'll send a grandma to jail, but it will be tough on them,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Barros </PERSON>, a tax preparer who specializes in day-care provider returns. The law applies only to day care provided while parents are at work. `` We will indeed be cross-referencing to see if that baby sitter claimed that as income,'' said <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Wreford </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Day-care providers not claiming the payments as income on their tax returns could be required to pay back taxes with interest and a $ 50 fine, <PERSON> Wreford </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barros </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, says it may take the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> two or three years before it's equipped to double-check a large number of returns for day-care income. Baby sitters collecting money under the table may be more likely to raise their prices once they are required to declare the income, <PERSON> Barros </PERSON> said. The National Association for Family Day Care, a non-profit organization representing about 3,000 day-care providers, said it supports the new law. `` The association feels anything that can be done to provide a more professional setting for child care is beneficial,'' said <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollestelle </PERSON>, accreditation administrator. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> says parents who seek the deduction without providing the Social Security number or tax identification number of their day-care provider could be turned down for the credit. `` We may lose some providers,'' said <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Quarterman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit-Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There are some people whose clear intention is to make some money on the side and not report the income.'' The credit allows parents and those paying for the care of mentally or physically incompetent dependents to deduct a certain percentage of their care costs directly from their income taxes. Those eligible usually can claim a credit ranging from 30 percent of the expense, if their income does not exceed $ 10,000, to 20 percent if their income exceeds $ 28,000.

 A Shiite Moslem cleric linked to the captors of Western hostages was quoted Wednesday as saying <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is delaying efforts to gain freedom for eight American captives. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, spiritual head of the pro-Iranian group <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, told the pro-Syrian <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Ash-Sharq </ORGANIZATION>: `` In my opinion, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is following a plan for freezing the issue of the hostages at the media level.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, is widely believed to be the umbrella for <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> factions holding most of the 16 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can free its hostages in a very simple way,'' <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` Instead, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is using the hostages as a blackmail card in its so-called war against terrorism,'' <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> added, without elaboration.

<TEXT>
 A group of federal employees has charged that a consumer group is undermining a government auto safety program, but the head of the organization said Thursday that his group serves a useful watchdog function. `` The facts show that recalls are down and that defective vehicles are n't being recalled,'' said <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON>, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety. `` Our response is to continue to publicize when the agency does n't do its job.'' <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON>'s comments came after publication in Thursday's editions of The Washington Post of excerpts from a letter to him from 50 career employees at the National Highway Traffic Safety administration. Employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON> was undermining its safety defects program and that the center's attacks were `` eroding the public's confidence in our ability to pursue safety defects, thereby discouraging mortorists from submitting safety defect information to us.'' `` History proves them wrong,'' <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON> responded. `` Whenever we have criticized them, they get more complaints not less.'' <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON> said he had not received a copy of the letter but learned of it from media inquiries. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> called the letter `` a good clear statement of the frustration -LRB- the workers -RRB- feel in dealing with the CFAS.'' `` I think the employees are frustrated by the fact that they ca n't get recalls like they used to,'' <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON> said. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> had halted 25 investigations during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration under pressure from the auto industry. `` Although some of the decisions were more difficult than others, to charge that we are captives of the auto industry because investigations were closed ignores the facts completely,'' the letter said. It also accused <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON> of selling information obtained from the agency to lawyers representing automobile accident victims. <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON> said the center makes no profit from computer printouts it provides `` to the public, not just lawyers,'' with information on complaints about cars received by <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>, along with names and addresses of individuals making those complaints.

 Abolishing travel restrictions on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Soviet visitors in each other's countries would end a relic of the Cold War that is a nuisance but has little practical effect, an expert on U.S.-Soviet relations said Thursday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, speaking on condition they not be identified, said Secretary of States <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> would present the proposal to Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in their talks Friday and Saturday in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. It would lift virtually all travel restrictions on Soviet diplomats, trade representatives and journalists, the sources said. It was not known how the Soviets would respond to the proposal, clearly being made in light of the `` openness'' policies of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` It strikes me as a sensible thing to do at this stage,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garthoff </PERSON>, senior fellow in foreign policy studies at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> and a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think it's a terribly important matter, but I think it's an appropriate, a reasonable thing to do.'' The late Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> placed severe travel restrictions on foreigners in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the 1950s, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reciprocated with restrictions on travel by diplomats and other visitors from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other Eastern Bloc countries. These restrictions were gradually eliminated by agreements between the Soviet satellites and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1970's. <PERSON> Garthoff </PERSON> said he signed the last such agreement in 1978, when he was ambassador to <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. `` From then on I and my staff in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> were able to travel anywhere in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> that any other foreigner was, which meant in effect the whole country,'' the Brookings scholar said. Reciprocal travel restrictions by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> remained, however, with close to 90 percent of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> closed to Americans and much of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> off limits to visiting Soviets. `` They are more an annoyance than anything else,'' <PERSON> Garthoff </PERSON> said. `` They do n't really prevent the embassies from functioning adequately, but they do represent something of an anomaly in this era. I do n't think they are really effective in terms of preventing access or protecting information. They really are more political statements or gestures than anything else.'' In practice, Americans and Soviets occasionally are granted permission to enter the prohibited zones. For instance, Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> was permitted to visit off-limits parts of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> several dozen times, an official said. <PERSON> Garthoff </PERSON> said this was usually done on a `` tit for tat basis.'' He also said both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have made changes over the years in the amount of each other's territory that is closed. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal was dubbed `` Open Lands.'' If it is adopted, Soviets still would have to register their travel plans with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Foreign Missions for security reasons, officials said. They said the proposal had been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. `` The idea is to abolish the curbs on a reciprocal basis so travel theoretically is permitted everywhere,'' an official said.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration official in charge of next week's education summit with the nation's governors said Thursday that the most promising ideas for improving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> schools do n't require more money. The best ideas, including efforts to give parents more choice over which public school their child attends, `` revolve around more efficient use of the moneys that we are already spending,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s domestic policy adviser. They do not, he said, `` require more money.'' Accompaning <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to Wednesday and Thursday's <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, summit will be `` virtually the entire Cabinet,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. The White House, he said, is expecting perfect attendance from the governors of the 50 states, and several governors from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territories will be there. The aim of the largely closed-door deliberations on the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> campus will be to find new ideas to improve <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. The Democratic leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday unveiled their own goals for the nation's schools and promised to press for `` adequate'' funding to help meet them. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said Americans are spending $ 353 billion on education at all levels, from kindergarten through graduate school, including more than $ 5,200 for every public school pupil. `` We're not going to be announcing any goals at the end of the summit,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. `` What we will be announcing will be the process by which those goals are going to be developed.'' The post-summit process of drawing up those goals `` will involve parents and teachers and administrators and school boards.'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said the ideas that `` hold real promise for improving the bottom line ... invariably expand choice for parents and students; introduce greater flexibility, while demanding increased accountability for results.'' `` The president believes the current level of performance is not acceptable and simply doing more of the same is unlikely to improve it,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. `` New approaches and new ideas are needed.'' Although the agenda includes a discussion of expanding access to higher education and training more teachers, the focus will clearly be on problems in the lower grades. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, on leave as a professor of government at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s universities are `` really quite phenomenal,'' in part because they are `` incredibly diverse and ... highly competitive. The topics for the six working groups, announced last week by the governors, are: teaching; learning environment; governance; choice and restructuring; a competitive workforce and life-long learning; and post-secondary education. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will participate in each of the six working group sessions with 16 or 17 governors and five or six Cabinet members. The working sessions _ three simultaneous 90-minute discussions on both Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning _ will be held behind closed doors, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spending 30 minutes in each session. Each working group will be co-chaired by a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor and a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governor, with a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member moderating the discussion. A rapporteur will prepare a report that the president and the governors will consider in plenary sessions. The Democrats' national performance goals include lower dropout rates, higher college attendance rates and early childhood education for all poor 4-year-olds by 1995 or earlier.

I woke up late again _ like I say, I like to sleep late _ and went to a mall with my friend and ate Italian food.'' The hotline began this week and is expected to be updated daily. Callers pay $ 2 for the first minute and $ 1 for each minute thereafter.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> today as administration officials said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will propose to the Soviets a mutual lifting of almost all travel restrictions for diplomats, trade groups and journalists. The `` Open Lands'' initiative, imposed during the <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> era, surfaced as <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> opened high-level talks with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House, in advance of a weekend of talks with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. `` It's a big letter,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said when asked about a message he carried from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> deflected all questions, the president saying: `` This is a photo opportunity.'' The Soviet foreign minister carried with him still-secret proposals from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that could accelerate reductions in the superpowers' nuclear missile arsenals. Currently, nearly 90 percent of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is off limits to Americans, reflecting the suspicions that marked <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s rule The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> responded through the years to the curbs by imposing similar restrictions on a large part of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times first reported the removal of the travel restrictions in today's editions. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has approved the proposal and it is ready for <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to present to <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> during their talks Friday and Saturday in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, the officials said. If it is adopted, however, Soviets still would have to register their travel plans with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Foreign Missions. This is designed to address security concerns, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In practice, Americans and Soviets occasionally are granted permission to enter the prohibited zones. For instance, Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> was permitted to visit off-limits parts of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> several dozen times, an official said. It was not known how the Soviets would respond. But the `` Open Lands'' proposal obviously had in mind the more open policies of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` The idea is to abolish the curbs on a reciprocal basis so travel theoretically is permitted everywhere,'' an official said. Even before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received the message <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> brought from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the two sides had made siginificant progress on three fronts: human rights, chemical weapons and breaking the `` Ice Curtain'' that has divided Alaskan and Siberian Eskimos for more than 40 years. `` <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s letter contains some very important proposals, specifically, mostly on arms control and on reducing the military standoff between our two countries,'' he said through an interpreter. `` And those proposals, I have no doubt, serve to remove most of the obstacles holding up progress and an agreement.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> called for a speeding up of developments in U.S.-Soviet relations. `` We believe that we should not stand still, we should not mark time,'' he said. `` The experience that we have gained thus far permits us to hope that there will be further movement.'' According to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, the Soviets have given assurances that hundreds of Jews who were refused exit permits will be permitted to depart. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had presented lists of more than 500 so-called `` refuseniks.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> replied during meetings at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday and Tuesday that three-quarters of them would be allowed to leave, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. It was not immediately clear if in all instances exit permits would be granted, or if some applicants would be allowed only to travel abroad. Also, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official stressed, `` the proof will be in the documents issued.'' At separate arms control sessions, meanwhile, the two sides moved closer to an agreement to exchange data on their chemical weapons program and to open stockpiles and plants to inspection by the other side. Left for <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to resolve were details about the extent of the information to be swapped and whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons stored in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would be included in the inspection scheme. `` We're quite optimistic,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. They also are due to sign an accord for regular visits between the Yupik and Inupiat Eskimos of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, thereby shattering the so-called `` Ice Curtain.'' The Kremlin forbade travel across the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> in 1948. In a tactical switch, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not send advance word through diplomatic channels of the contents of the message for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Speculation centered on a new approach to break the deadlock on a treaty to reduce by 30 percent to 50 percent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet stockpiles of the deadliest nuclear weapons _ long-range bombers, missiles and submarines. But whatever <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s letter contained _ and <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, the Soviet foreign ministry spokesman, would not say Wednesday on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> television _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> were determined to deflect criticism by some congressional Democrats that the administration was reflexive in dealing with the East. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday that `` we do want to move forward and are working inside our own administration to have the proposals that I think will capture the imagination of the Soviet people.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, at a news conference Tuesday, announced that `` to start the ball rolling'' on strategic weapons negotiations the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would withdraw its proposal for a ban on mobile missiles. The move has limited consequences. The administration already is asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to fund the development of the Midgetman mobile missile. And in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> negotiations, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has long taken the position that a ban would be dropped after ways to keep track of the elusive weapons were perfected. Still, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> offered assurances the administration had not taken a `` wait-and-see'' approach toward <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

 A grand jury has handed up an 11-count indictment charging a federal drug agent, his wife and the owner of a construction company with conspiracy, tax evasion and laundering large amounts of cash, officials said Thursday.

 A teen-ager whose steer won grand prize at the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> State Fair will forfeit her ribbon and $ 28,000 following charges the animal had been entered another name in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and its hide dyed to conceal the ruse. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Expositions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> approved 10-0 today an agreement reached with the family of 17-year-old <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shealy </PERSON>, whose Angus-cross steer <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> won the blue ribbon in August. `` The message is not to cheat at the livestock show at the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> State Fair,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Foust </PERSON>, general manager of the fair. <PERSON> Foust </PERSON> said officials could not prove suspicions that <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> had been shown under the name <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> at an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> farm show in July _ a violation of the rules. But there was no question, officials said, that a white spot on <PERSON> Hank </PERSON>'s belly had been dyed black at the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> fair, also a violation. Under the agreement, the <PERSON> Shealy </PERSON> family admitted no wrongdoing, but the girl from <PERSON> Tiro </PERSON> will not get her prize money and must give up the ribbon. She and her family also were barred from competition for five years. Family members did not return messages today. Farm shows have become increasingly lucrative for farm children who raise champion livestock. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> was sold for $ 28,000 at the fair Aug. 14. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON>'s credentials came into question when fair officials received a tip five days later that <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> might be <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>, a second-place steer at a farm show in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> on July 24. Investigators said black dye had been used to cover a swirl of white hair on <PERSON> Hank </PERSON>'s belly. A similar white patch can be seen in a photograph of <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>. Fair rules prohibit misrepresentation of an animal's history or ownership and any alterations in an animal's natural appearance. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> was impounded when the investigation began so investigators could wait for his hair to grow out. The family of 12-year-old <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, who exhibited <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> fair, has also denied any wrongdoing. They said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> was destroyed after the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> fair.

 A former salesman for the company that prints Business Week pleaded guilty Thursday to conspiring to trade on advance information about stocks mentioned in the magazine's influential `` Inside Wall Street'' column <PERSON> Shayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, also pleaded guilty to perjury for lying under oath to an investigator of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The plea expands to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> the government's investigation of illegal trading using purloined copies of the business weekly from 1986 to 1988. The magazine was not charged. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> was a sales representative for R.R. <ORGANIZATION> Donnelley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based printer of Business Week, from January 1983 until April. In entering the plea, <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> agreed to cooperate in the federal investigation. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewenson </PERSON> said his office would recommend a lenient sentence for <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> based on the information he gives the government. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> faces up to five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine on each of two charges. He is to be sentenced April 24. The conspiracy charge alleged that from September 1986 to July 1988, <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> obtained advance copies of Business Week from the <PERSON> Donnelley </PERSON> printing plant in <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and then supplied them to his stockbroker who traded on companies reported favorably in the `` Inside Wall Street'' column. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> told the judge he would leave his house at 3:45 a.m. on Thursdays, the day the magazine was distributed, and drive 45 miles to the plant to get a copy of the magazine. He then would drive back to his hometown and give the magazine to his stockbroker, <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said. He also said the stockbroker, who was not identified, paid him for some of the advance copies. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> was the latest person to plead guilty to schemes involving trading on prepublication copies of `` Inside Wall Street.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> broker, and <ORGANIZATION> S.G. </ORGANIZATION> `` <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruderman </PERSON>, the former broadcast editor for Business Week, had previously pleaded guilty to similar charges. Both were sentenced to six months in prison. At least seven other <PERSON> Donnelley </PERSON> employees have either resigned or been fired in wake of the Business Week scandal. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> also has sued <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> and five others. In a settlement reached with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> in August, <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> agreed to pay $ 62,000 in restitution and civil penalties _ an amount double his illegal profits. The perjury charge to which <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> pleaded guilty said he lied to an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> investigator on March 16 when he said he had never seen an advance copy of Business Week.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops sent to restore calm to the hurricane-ravaged <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> `` are having an obvious impact in controlling the looting and other lawlessness,'' White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today. `` Our purpose is to help out in an interim and temporary way until the local law enforcement can handle the problem,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> authorized the use of the troops to halt a looting frenzy and protect residents and tourists from the lawlessness gripping <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> two days after Hurricane Hugo's devastation. `` The situation there is improving somewhat,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` The troops are having an obvious impact in controlling the looting and other lawlessness associated with the destruction.'' He said it was impossible to predict how long the troops, which began arriving this morning, would remain on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>. `` We stay in close contact with the police authorities on the islands and the governors and will be guided by their feelings about when they're in control and when they can handle the situation,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said in an interview today that the troops have been issued rifles and ordered to shoot if necessary to defend themselves. `` Certainly, we never deploy troops if they do n't have the right to defend themselves,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said. `` We've had reports of shooting on the island. We're not going to permit people to be totally defenseless.'' The chairman said the decision was made to send in the troops after `` federal authorities on the scene were reporting chaos, and near-anarchy and the situation as being out of control.'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> added that he envisioned the troops would remain on the island a `` very short period of time,'' but he did not define the time any further. `` The task force commander, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, is now on the scene and is assessing the situation,'' said Lt. Comdr. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundquist </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` He will deploy troops as necessary.'' <PERSON> Lundquist </PERSON> said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was on board the first plane of some 76 military personnel that arrived at 7:40 a.m. EDT. The contingent formed an advance team that planned to secure the airfield, set up a mobile control tower and organize the command structure for the other troops that will be arriving later in the day. `` Members of the armed forces of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be used to suppress the violence ... and to restore law and order in and about the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a statement Wednesday night. It appeared to be the first time in more than 20 years that a president ordered active duty military personnel into the nation's streets About 700 soldiers began leaving <ORGANIZATION> Pope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, early today. `` I think the show of force is going to go a long way -LRB- in ending the looting -RRB-,'' said Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiner </PERSON>, commander of the 18th <ORGANIZATION> Airborne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>. The Pentagon said in a statement that 1,105 military police would begin arriving in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> by early morning on 16 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-141 Starlifter transport planes. The units were to include 635 military police from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; and 470 military police from companies in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leonard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, armed <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> crewmen from at least one of the six <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ships in the area went ashore on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, the largest of the three main <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> at 84 square miles, to try to restore order. After Hugo hit <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, damaging virtually every building on the island of 53,000, looters stripped stores of merchandise and many residents armed themselves with guns and knives. To counter roaming lawless mobs, merchants posted armed guards. Local National Guardsmen and police reportedly joined in the looting. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, Maj. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON>, said the reports involving Guardsmen were not confirmed. On Wednesday, the popular tourist retreat still lacked water, power and telephone service. Hurricane winds that stripped trees turned the lush island southeast of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> into a brown wasteland. The island's governor said <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> caused no deaths, but hundreds of people were reported injured and thousands left homeless. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redfield </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, a territorial senator, said as much as 90 percent of the island was destroyed. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutters evacuated frightened tourists and residents, some of whom had pleaded with arriving reporters to take them off. About 145 St. Croix tourists arrived in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> late Thursday night on an evacuation flight arranged by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals. The injured, elderly and pregnant women were given first priority, and other passengers were taken on a space-available basis. `` We just got lucky,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` The looters were everywhere there. They said, ` We're in charge now.' At one grocery store, they just rolled up trucks and loaded them up.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Brotman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who was on temporary assignment in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, said he first had to protect himself from the storm, then the armed looters. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> said Wednesday night he did not ask for the federal troops. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said the governor of the islands requested the them, and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said later the governor's denial was `` contrary to the information I have.'' Usually, in cases of civil disturbances, it is the Guard that is called out to help restore order, but federal law allows the president to declare an emergency during civil disturbances and to use federal troops to restore calm. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential assistant <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicconi </PERSON> was asked what orders would be given the troops about the use of force. He replied, `` I'm sure they'd use only that which was necessary and appropriate.'' The Pentagon also was dispatching three small reconnaissance OH-58 helicopters, some transport vehicles and `` appropriate medical support,'' the agency's statement said. The last time federal troops were used to suppress riots was in 1968 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, after the assassination of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, administration officials said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> authorized the use of troops in 1987 to deal with prison riots in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, but that trouble subsided before they were deployed.

However, <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said `` there is insufficient initiative from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to prepare for the challenges of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> century.'' `` And key <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> powers appear too willing to trot out the same tired excuses to avoid the tough decisions necessary to organize for the challenge of the 21st century,'' said <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, chairman of the Foreign Relations subcommittee on <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. A Pacific Basin Forum, <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said, `` would allow us to pursue such crucial issues as free trade, economic development and security confidence building.'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> called for the establishment of a permanent secretariat to do research and pursue dialogue on a wide range of concerns. `` Unless we undertake a deliberate effort to establish a more mutually beneficial business climate, trade tensions with <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> may well increase in the years ahead as export-led development by the remarkably successful capitalist nations of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> continues,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> claims in a federal lawsuit the state should n't be allowed to prosecute the rail service on criminal charges over the dumping of human waste from train toilets. `` The enforcement of the statutes in question would impose undue burdens on <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, the only interstate passenger railroad, and threaten the continuation of intercity passenger service in <LOCATION> Floria </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> lawyers <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>. Some train cars used by the national passenger service dump waste directly onto railroad bridges and overpasses when toilets are flushed. Other cars have tanks that automatically release waste onto tracks when a train reaches a speed of 25 mph. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> contends in the lawsuit filed Tuesday that federal laws governing rail service supersede state laws under which prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> filed charges. The railroad is asking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> to halt prosecution in <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, calling the charges an unconstitutional hindrance to interstate commerce. Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayer </PERSON> rejected <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s argument and said the state would press on with the case. The railroad already had pleaded innocent to the dumping charges. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> operates 12 trains daily in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.

 Sixteen Shiite Moslems from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> were beheaded Thursday for exploding two bombs in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> at the height of the Moslem pilgrimage to the holy city, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. An <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement implicitly blamed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the attacks, which killed a man and were believed connected to the centuries-old feud between Sunni and Shiite Moslems. Four other Kuwaitis were sentenced to 15 years and 20 years in prison and 1,000 to 1,500 whiplashes for the bomb blasts, the ministry statement said. Nine defendants were acquitted, it said. Convictions and sentences were decided and confirmed by lower and appellate courts of Islamic scholars, the statement said. A Pakistani man was killed and 16 other pilgrims of various nationalities were wounded when the bombs went off the night of July 10 as 2 million Moslems gathered for the culmination of the pilgrimage, or hajj. Thursday's report was the first official word that arrests had been made in connection with the blasts near the Grand Mosque in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, Islam's holiest shrine. The executions were carried out `` in accordance with Islamic law,'' the statement said without elaborating. Sources close to the government, who requested anonymity, said the Kuwaitis were blindfolded and beheaded by sword at dawn in a Mecca prison compound. Government sources said <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> refused a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> request to extradite the bombers. Full confessions from the condemned men will be broadcast on television, the announcement said. It described the blasts as `` an evil crime ... an aggression on the sanctity of the holy sites and on the pilgrims ... -LRB- and -RRB- of the entire Moslem nation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the defendants plotted the attack at meetings in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and the Saudi city of <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>. Their aim, it said, was to spread `` terror and fear in the hearts of the pilgrims ... and show that -LRB- <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> -RRB- was unable to protect the house of God.'' Every Moslem, Sunni or Shiite, has a duty to make the pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, the birthplace of the 7th century prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, and to <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, where <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> is buried. Sunnis and Shiites disagree about who should have succeeded <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which has an overwhelming majority of Shiites among its nearly 50 million people, had been urging Moslems to seize <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>. Without naming <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s statement said the July bombings were perpetrated `` at the instructions of the mischievous ones, who are enemies of this nation and for all pilgrims of God's house, and cooperating with those mischievous ones on such debauchery and terrorism in the most sacred spot in the world. Since the late <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s 1979 Islamic revolution in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, Iranian pilgrims have tried to turn the hajj into a political forum to spread his fundamentalist teachings. In 1987, Iranian pilgrims clashed with <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> security, leading to the deaths of 402 pilgrims, most Iranians. After that, <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> restricted the numbers of pilgrims. This drew protests from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which boycotted the 1988 and 1989 pilgrimages. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, citing subversion and terrorism, severed relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in April 1988.

<HEAD>Wildlife Group Pays for Wolf Damage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A conservation group that has been pressing for expansion of wolf ranges said Thursday that it has agreed to pay two <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> ranchers for livestock believed lost to wolves. Defenders of Wildlife said it will pay $ 1,700 to the ranchers to compensate for the loss of a cow and seven calves. The group said it is paying full market price for the cow, which animal experts said was a definite wolf kill. Government officials said the calves were probably wolf kills, and the group paid the farmers 50 percent of their value. Defenders began offering compensation for stock lost to wolves three years ago. The only other claims under the program came in 1987 when it paid farmers $ 3,200 in compensation for 10 sheep and five cows. The program is part of the non-profit group's effort to encourage the reintroduction of wolves into the northern Rockies, including <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>. Stockmen in that region have opposed restoration of wolves to the area, fearing losses to the animals. `` Those of us who would like to see wolves return to select locations in the northern <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION> are ready and willing to assume financial responsibility for such a program,'' said <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> of Defenders of Wildlife.

 Cambodians showered Vietnamese soldiers with flowers Thursday as they began their final withdrawal from a war that started with a Christmas invasion 11 years ago and ended the bloody rule of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. The Vietnamese-installed government said it would carry on the fight against a three-party guerrilla coalition. `` Our friends go, but the special Cambodian-Vietnamese relationship does not,'' said a red banner in front of dozens of military vehicles that rumbled out of this northwestern province to the blare of a pop music band in a government-organized ceremony. The only observers of the fanfare were foreign journalists and official delegations from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s socialist allies _ <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the main source of arms for the war. As the withdrawal began, <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> returned home from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> without a cease-fire agreement. The Thais had tried to patch a truce together after a failed international peace conference. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> called on countries to honor pledges to halt aid to the guerrillas after the Vietnamese pullout. Vietnamese officials said 26,000 troops from Siem Reap and other areas will cross the border into southern <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> by Tuesday, ending <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s involvement in the war that erupted after it invaded to oust its former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> comrade, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and two non-communist guerrilla organizations in the resistance coalition say the withdrawal is a ploy and charge <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is hiding troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The coalition commands 50,000 fighters. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> shared that skepticism Thursday. `` It -LRB- <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> -RRB- is still employing tricks on the question of troop withdrawal and placing a variety of obstacles in the way of a comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian question,'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON> told reporters. Some observers have called <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s intervention `` <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' _ likening its withdrawal from a costly, agonizing war against forces it could not eradicate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> says 55,300 Vietnamese died fighting the Cambodians, half of them in 1977 and 1978 before their Christmas invasion. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s impoverished population of 65 million also suffered from economic blockades mounted by non-Communist countries outraged by the invasion It ended the rule of <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, who led <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> efforts to force an agrarian revolution in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Hundreds of thousands of civilians were slain. `` The West should stop supporting the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and stop being fooled by <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> propaganda,'' senior <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Uch </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiman </PERSON> said at the farewell ceremony. He said his Vietnamese-backed government is prepared to continue fighting, but added he does not believe his country ever would ask the Vietnamese to return. <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> rejects U.S.-backed demands from the non-Communist guerrillas who say they rather would have a transitional government including the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the most powerful resistance faction, than continue fighting it. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Huol </PERSON> <PERSON> Savorn </PERSON>, regional commander of Cambodian forces, said his troops have taken over the fighting from the Vietnamese this year in the hotly contested provinces bordering <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. After the pullout, the guerrillas will launch a major offensive to try to occupy border areas before striking further into <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, he told reporters. Fighting already has intensified. Cambodian refugees at a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> camp on the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border Thursday threatened a strike and demanded to be moved to a safer place after four to eight artillery shells exploded close by their camp overnight, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugee worker said. Across the border, departing Vietnamese troops carried rifles along with flowers and miniature flags thrown by thousands of Cambodians. The Cambodians, many looking glum and uninterested, stood outside a kindergarten school built by Vietnamese troops of the departing Front 479, and waved flags and placards praising and thanking them. Organized by authorities into groups were students, soldiers, and hundreds of children in red kerchiefs _ `` young pioneers'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. On a makeshift wooden stage, military officers made speeches denouncing `` Pol Pot genocide,'' and four elderly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks in saffron robes prayed for peace. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Anh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lon </PERSON>, commander of Front 479, hugged a Cambodian officer and received a kerchief from a young pioneer and a bouquet of flowers. The general waved the flowers as he climbed into his weather-beaten U.S.-made jeep to begin the long journey southeast. Departing soldiers carried back guitars, photos of Vietnamese actresses clipped from newspapers, even dogs and a monkey. Some had served in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> since 1979 and said they were glad to return home to their families. `` Pol Pot soldiers are weak and we are strong,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> <PERSON> Viet </PERSON> <PERSON> Duong </PERSON>, 32, who in eight years fought many battles against them and had five medals on his chest to prove it. Unlike many Vietnamese soldiers, he said he was never hungry and had malaria only once.

<HEAD>737-400: A Good Record, But Some Problems</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-USAir Crash, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities have been investigating recent engine problems on the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400, the latest model of the 737 series and the type that crashed into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from a runway at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Officials said the cause of Wednesday night's crash was unknown and there was no initial indication that the 9-month-old plane might have had engine trouble. Passengers said they felt the engine power being cut and then felt reverse thrust as the pilot apparently tried to stop the aircraft. The twin-engine 737, which can carry up to 150 passengers, has one of the longest and safest histories of any commercial jet. The 737-400 differs from previous models in that it has a more powerful version of the CFM56 engine, which is produced jointly by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Snecma </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> company, said <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. A 737-400 operated by British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> crashed Jan. 8 beside a highway about 100 miles north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, killing 44 people. It used CFM56-3C engines; the <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> jet in Wednesday's accident had CFM56-3B2 engines. British investigators said initially that the crash may have resulted from a fire in one engine and the crew mistakenly shutting down the other engine, but no official report has yet been issued on the cause, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. In June, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> ordered most of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400s then in operation grounded because of two incidents in one week in which the engines failed. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> ordered airlines to replace certain parts on the -3 B2 engines and restrict their power output because of safety concerns Most of the planes affected were inspected and returned to service within a few weeks. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> flight that went down was a short-haul flight for which full thrust would not have been needed. He also said the plane probably was not involved in the grounding because of its age. A thumbnail sketch of the 737-400: LENGTH: 119 feet, 7 inches. WINGSPAN: 94 feet, 9 inches. ENGINES: Two turbofan jets built by <ORGANIZATION> CFM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the French industrial consortium <ORGANIZATION> SNECMA </ORGANIZATION>. CAPACITY: Pilot, co-pilot and up to 146 passengers and flight attendants in typical mixed-class configuration, or up to 168 in charter configuration. RANGE: Up to 2,879 miles.

Elimination of the visa requirement `` means that family members will be able to see each other again,'' said <PERSON> Janie </PERSON> <PERSON> Leask </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natives </ORGANIZATION>. `` It means that a people divided by an artificial boundary will once again be able to share experiences and their culture. `` I expect quite a bit of travel, especially from those villages along the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> coast.'' One of those planning to go is <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> <PERSON> Tungiyan </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Gambell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now that we've seen some of the ... Russians here at <LOCATION> Gambell </LOCATION> we've made friends, and more than likely we have long lost relatives we have n't seen since the 1930s,'' <PERSON> Tungiyan </PERSON> said. Improved U.S.-Soviet relations in the past year have resulted in several trips across the strait and reunions. This week, 34 natives from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have been participating in the <ORGANIZATION> Bering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Straits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>. Bering Air of Nome recently began offering charter flights between that town, 100 miles southeast of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> port town of <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION>. Although the need for visas will end, passports still will be required. People from each side of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> will be allowed non-visa visits of up to 90 days if they have been invited by relatives or other people with whom they share a cultural heritage.

 The tiny pieces of <ORGANIZATION> UTA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 772 first appeared like confetti in the sand. Then big chunks of the fuselage, shattered in the crash that killed all 171 people aboard, came into view. It was hard to imagine, during a low-level flight over the crash scene, that the pieces ever came together to form a jumbo jet. Investigators in the <LOCATION> Tenere </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> worked in 113-degree heat Thursday to determine a cause for the crash of the Paris-bound DC-10 two days earlier. They recovered the flight and voice recorders from the wreckage, a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said Thursday night. UTA, or the Union des <ORGANIZATION> Transportes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeriens </ORGANIZATION>, a private French company that serves <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, says a bomb was the most likely reason that debris spread over as much as 40 square miles. The pro-Iranian group <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility in separate telephone calls in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, although officials said they could not authenticate the claim. Strewn across the sand was a piece of the wing of the 16-year-old white and blue DC-10, and miles away, the tail. The bright colors of clothes dumped from shattered bags contrasted with a dull brown landscape. Blackened bodies were scattered across the desert. The dead included seven Americans, among them <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>, wife of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>. Other victims included a Chadian Cabinet minister, two Swiss priests and eight children. Two French military helicopters were stationed at a small camp at the site. Two tents and several small vehicles, some with <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> markings also were seen. The force was flown in from neighboring <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>. They were gathering the bodies to fly them to <LOCATION> N'Djamena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> for identification, according to Col. <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Job </PERSON>, commander of the French forces in <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>. His men were the ones who located the wreckage and were the first on the scene. The <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> appointed a commission to analyze the information from the plane's flight and voice recorders. The plane was on a flight from <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. It disappeared 400 miles northwest of <LOCATION> N'Djamena </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Chadian </LOCATION> capital, where it had made a stop. The crash area is about 150 miles east of <LOCATION> Agadez </LOCATION>, a city in central <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>. Crash investigation experts were en route from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Other officials were on site from <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said it was reviewing information from the crash to determine whether to open a criminal investigation. Anti-terrorism statutes give the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> jurisdiction to investigate terrorist attacks on Americans overseas. `` There is always a possibility of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation. Right now we are on consultation wth other government agencies,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinmetz </PERSON>. `` It's certainly a serious issue we are placing a significant amount of importance on.'' Before the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> can enter such cases, it must get permission of the country where the crime occurred. An anonymous caller to the news agency in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> was responsible for the plane's downing and demanded the release of Shiite Moslem religious leader <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, who was kidnapped from southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on July 28 by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> forces. Islamic Jihad is among several radical fundamentalist groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> believed to be part of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, the umbrella group thought to hold 16 Westerners hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> is a member of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UTA </ORGANIZATION> said it received an anonymous telephone call about midnight Tuesday, before the downed aircraft had been located by a French military plane, saying <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> was responsible.

<HEAD>Two Americans Claim New Discovery of Noah's Ark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Americans claimed Thursday to have discovered <PERSON> Noah </PERSON>'s ark on the southwest side of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ararat </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> while flying over it by helicopter. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, the pilot, said a square boat shape was spotted 14,500 feet up on the mountain in a place usually covered by a glacier. He said the area was exposed this summer because of high temperatures in the region near the Soviet border. `` We are 100 percent sure this is the ark,'' <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview. There have been various claims of the discovery of the ark since <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> lifted a ban on climbing the mountain in 1982. Many Christian fundamentalists, who interpret the Bible literally, believe the ark must be on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ararat </LOCATION>. The biblical account in the Book of Genesis said that after the great deluge, the ark came to rest on the mountain with <PERSON> Noah </PERSON>'s family and a cargo of male and female pairs of every kind of animal. But geologists say even though there is evidence of a flood in <LOCATION> Mesopotamia </LOCATION> in Sumerian times, they maintain it is not possible for a ship to make landfall at an altitude as high as <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ararat </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> said he and his partner, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbe </PERSON>, discovered and photographed the object they believe is the ark during a Sept. 15 flight. He said he and <PERSON> Garbe </PERSON>, a pharmacist in <LOCATION> Colombus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, have made five flights in the last three years in search of the ark on the 16,000-foot-high mountain. He said the glacier on the mountain only melts enough to expose the boat every 20 or 30 years. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garbe </PERSON> belong to the Orlando-based <ORGANIZATION> Immanuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Expeditions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> said they used donations and $ 60,000 of their own funds to finance the expedition. He said they plan to return next year for a June climb to the spot with a team of 20 that will include geologists and archeologists. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> said they based their search on information provided by an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> pilot, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, who said he saw the same boat shape at the same spot during a flight in 1943, and on other reported sightings.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration formally asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Thursday for $ 9 million to help the election campaign of Nicaraguan opposition candidate <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, declaring, `` We are at a watershed in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' In a message to congressional leaders asking for the assistance, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> called the February 1990 election between <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>'s opposition coalition and incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> `` a rare chance for us to support democratization in a totalitarian society.'' Most congressional Democrats were still evaluating the proposal, but initial reaction was positive. After a White House meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> _ who will be an observer at the elections _ said he would support the initiative. The administration wants to rush legislation through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the next week or so in order to make money available in time for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s one-month voter registration season in October. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> has a chance to win, but added, `` We should n't be under any illusions about the battle they face.'' He noted that the Sandinistas would use all resources at their command _ the army, the secret police, the government bureaucracy and mass organizations _ to further their political fortunes. Despite the odds, the opportunity to install a new government is a rare opportunity, he said. `` We are at a watershed in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> wrote. The election `` pits an under-financed democratic coalition against an authoritarian state.'' The aid package would transfer $ 5 million to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> for activities like election monitoring, voter registration, get-out-the vote efforts and party-building. NED, a private foundation created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 to support democratic elections worldwide, has undertaken similar efforts in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. Another $ 4 million would be left `` flexible,'' the administration said, but could go for election monitoring by groups like <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>; civic education and get-out-the-vote campaigns; help in registering Nicaraguan expatriates to vote; and to pay necessary `` taxes'' to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan law requires that any foreign money coming into the election process be matched by a contribution to the council, which oversees and runs the elections. The money would be transferred from unused funds that had been earmarked for verification teams overseeing a cease-fire in the country and for humanitarian aid for the anti-Sandinista Contra rebels. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who will be an official observer at the elections, said there is a need `` to make sure that the opposition parties do have adequate funds to make the playing field level,'' as well as a need for money to pay for running the mechanics of the election.'' He noted that there 4,394 polling places and that each needs 11 observers _ one from each party. `` That is going to cost some money,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> `` to encourage him in his observer effort, ask that he try to get the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to allow other observers down there as well,'' said White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The leftist government has blocked some other international observers.

 A former aide at the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry testified Thursday that she still thinks founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was underpaid, even though she was laid off during the period he is accused of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacco </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury said she's still loyal to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> `` and I'm proud of it. I feel loyalty because I've seen what this man built A greedy man does n't have his hair turn gray in five years. `` I would n't have taken his job for $ 10 million a year.'' Ms. <PERSON> Sacco </PERSON>, who answered correspondence for the ministry until her layoff in 1986, was one of the first witnesses to testify for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> as the defense phase of the 3 -LCB- - week-old fraud trial got under way The defense presented videotapes of old `` <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'' shows on Wednesday before calling the first witnesses Thursday. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who resigned from the ministry in a sex-and-money scandal in 1987, is accused of fleecing his followers by diverting $ 3.7 million raised from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> partners to finance a lavish lifestyle. Prosecution witnesses testified that he and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, received six-figure bonuses in the years before his resignation even though the ministry was in financial trouble. Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is not charged in the case. If found guilty on all 24 counts, he could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than $ 5 million. Partners, who contributed at least $ 1,000, were promised a set number of days per year of free lodging at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> theme park in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, S.C. But most of the lodging planned there was never built. Still, Ms. <PERSON> Sacco </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was `` very concerned about the partners. He wanted them treated fairly and politely. He said these were the people who built this place.'' Government attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> asked Ms. <PERSON> Sacco </PERSON> if she ever heard <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> telling people he oversold any of the partnerships. `` I believe he did not know if, indeed, they were oversold,'' she said. `` Why would a man who worked so hard fleece his partners and destroy the place he built?'' `` How about the Rolls-Royces and $ 500,000 homes?'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> asked. `` Was n't he entitled to have a home?'' she said. `` How many homes was he entitled to?'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> asked, referring to prosecution allegations about luxury homes in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> as well as a lavish home at <LOCATION> Tega </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>. She did n't respond In a heated exchange during the cross-examination, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> asked her how an additional $ 3 million would have affected PTL. After being asked the same question several times, Ms. <PERSON> Sacco </PERSON> replied: `` I guess many people could have been helped, yes.'' Another witness, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, the owner of a gas station, testified that she bought six lifetime partnerships at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> and was always able to obtain reservations at the Christian retreat. She contradicted other partners who had testified for the prosecution that they had been unable to get reservations. Under questioning by defense attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, she described the atmosphere at <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>. `` I want to say it's heavenly, but I do n't know what heaven is like,'' she said. `` I can tell you that people were happy there.'' She testified that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had helped her kick her cigarette habit and that she considered <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> to be a holy place. Also Thursday, <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON>, who worked at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s adoption agency, said the ministry sheltered pregnant teen-agers and succeeded in placing their babies in good homes. `` Those families that could were asked to contribute, but by and large the bills were paid for by <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. She described the main purpose of the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> home for unwed mothers as `` saving babies from abortion.''

 The historic Bedford Springs Hotel went on the auction block Thursday, but its owners rejected the high bid of $ 5.3 million as not enough for the 185-year-old building and 2,300 acres of mountain land. `` I think the vultures were here looking to scoop up a bargain,'' said <PERSON> Hobert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Sky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the resort. `` We've been in a lot of battles. We're not going to give up the war.'' About 200 people crowded into the lobby of the <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> hotel, but neither the owner nor auctioneer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> would say how many bids were offered during the hourlong auction. Neither identified the high bidder. The auction was held nine days before $ 4.8 million is due to <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>. The money was spent out of a $ 7.5 million loan made in 1987 for renovations never completed because of a dispute between owners that ended up in federal bankruptcy court. <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> would not say how much <ORGANIZATION> Sky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> wants for the 244-room hotel and surrounding land, which includes a golf course and wooded trails. As for the bidding, he said, `` It was considerably far off.'' He said the owners would continue to seek new financing to pay <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> before it forecloses on the property. <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> said the high bid would not have covered second mortgages on the property and unsecured debt. `` We'd rather take our chances that in nine more days we can find the financing,'' <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> said. `` We're going to continue and say a lot of prayers.'' The hotel is a stately stretch of three - and four-story buildings in the <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> In its glory days, it attracted notables including six presidents, but now all but 66 of its 244 rooms have been closed to guests.

 <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> has asked distributors to pull Thunderbird and Night Train _ the drink of choice among derelicts _ from Skid Row liquor stores across the nation. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; J. Gallo Winery, ordered retailers in such areas Wednesday to halt sales of the high-alcohol, screw-top wines. The Skid Rows were not identified. At the same time, the company said, the wines should not be blamed for the problem of drinking among street people. Rather, retailers who sell the products to `` obvious alcoholic derelicts'' should be stopped by stricter enforcement of laws, the winery said. `` This practice has led to the assertion that these products cause Skid Row conditions and, therefore, that by stopping the sale of high-proof wine the problem of Skid Row can be solved,'' the company said. `` We believe this thinking is naive and that the use of these products on Skid Row is merely a symptom and not a cause.'' Thunderbird and Night Train are made with a hint of wine flavor and fortified with grape brandy to boost the percentage of alcohol to about 18 percent. The wines usually sell for 90 cents to $ 1.50 for a three-quarter liter bottle. <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> called the wines `` an affordable alternative to other alcoholic beverages'' and warned that alcoholics deprived of one source will simply find another. The company claims about 26 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wine market, with estimated sales of four million cases of the two wines each year. <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, with about 20 commercial brands, is a privately held company with total sales of reportedly more than $ 1 billion annually.

 A woman fighting for control of seven frozen embryos in an unprecedented divorce case on Thursday was awarded temporary custody by a judge who ruled that life begins at conception and the woman should be allowed to carry them to term. <ORGANIZATION> Blount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION>, ruling in favor of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> over her estranged husband, <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, declared that their embryos were children not property. `` I'm thrilled. It's definitely what I wanted,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Titusville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, where she now lives. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he would appeal in the state court system, and potentially beyond. `` They are going to force me to become a father against my wishes,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said she would not try to get pregnant immediately. `` I'm waiting to see about the appeal then hopefully after that try to have a child,'' she said. `` I could -LRB- try -RRB- at any time, but I have to recover from all of this and then consider starting the program.'' She added that the earliest she would try to get pregnant was January. `` As far as we are aware, this is the first judicial decision which has declared an embryo a human being,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' attorney, adding that he would ask the court to prevent Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> from implanting the embryos until appeals are settled. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said the ruling could conflict with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s landmark <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision allowing women to have abortions <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON>, the attorney who will handle <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' appeal, said the decision might also conflict with state laws on property interests and anatomical gifts. The case grew out of the decade-old technology of `` test-tube babies,'' or in-vitro fertilization. The Davises became embroiled in the dispute after they were unable to have children and turned to in vitro fertilization. The couple produced nine embryos in December under the guidance of Dr. <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> at a <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> clinic. Two were implanted in Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> but failed to develop. The others were put in cold storage. But then, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> sued for divorce in February. During testimony in August, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 31, said he would feel `` raped of my reproductive rights'' if Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> were allowed to implant the embryos without his consent. Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 29, argued the embryos represent her best chance of becoming a mother. She contended that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was seeking a right not normally given to a man _ whether a child should be born after he has fertilized the egg of his mate. After declaring the four - to eight-cell embryos to be children, Young in effect treated the case like a custody dispute, in which the overriding concern is the best interest of the child `` From fertilization, the cells of a human embryo are differentiated, unique and specialized to the highest degree of distinction,'' the judge said. Thus, he said, `` human life begins at conception.'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> could have temporary custody so that she could have the eggs implanted in her womb in hopes of becoming pregnant. Child support, visitation and final custody will be decided if a birth results, he wrote. `` It was the toughest decision of my life as a judge,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said in an interview. `` On a scale of 1 to 10, it was a 10. I have agonized over it.'' Young's ruling relied on a 1988 federal appeals court decision from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> affirming the reliability of DNA profiling in determining a person's individuality _ `` that the life codes for each special, unique individual are resident at conception and animate the new person very soon after fertilization occurs.''

In the in vitro process, eggs are extracted surgically from a woman's body and mixed with sperm in a laboratory dish. Those that are fertilized can be implanted in the womb. Testimony indicated the success rate for the procedure averages about one in five. The Davises' divorce is not yet final. In his ruling Thursday, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> instructed Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> to file final papers that would complete the proceeding.

 Storm-weary residents searched for scare water, gasoline and grocery items Thursday as crews worked to restore the island's water and elecricity, knocked out by Hurricane Hugo. Police said a 94-year-old woman, <PERSON> Emilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Negron </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>, was found dead Wednesday in her home in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, raising to 26 the number of deaths blamed on Hurricane Hugo. The storm hit the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commonwealth Monday after passing through a string of <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands. Police said the woman apparently fell, was unable to get up and drowned when water rushed into her home. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday declared <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> federal disaster areas, making them eligible for emergency relief funds. A team of 1,100 soldiers dispatched by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> entered the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Croix </ORGANIZATION>, which was pummeled by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> and then hit by a looting frenzy. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said about 600 people had been evacuated from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>. It said crewmen on board the cutter Bear reported that the city of Fredericksted in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> `` erupted'' at sunset Wednesday and that firing from automatic weapons and small arms could be heard. Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, described the situation as `` near anarchy'' and said troops had rifles and were ordered to shoot if necessary to defend themselves. But presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the situation had improved. `` The troops are having an obvious impact in controlling the looting and other lawlessness associated with the destruction. It is impossible to say at this point how long they will have to be there,'' he said. Gov. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> said the government was taking an inventory of the damage and expected disaster relief money to be made available within two weeks. The Red Cross was sending thousands of cots and bedding for some of the island's estimated 25,000 people still in shelters. Coast Guard planes continued shuttling food, medicine, bedding and clothes to the 8,500 residents of the offshore islands of <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Culebra </LOCATION>, which were devastated by the hurricane. Seventy percent of the island remained without water and 25 percent was without electricity. Health officials warned a possible health hazard if the island remained without water for much longer. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Puerto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aqueduct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sewer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, said five electric motors for water pumps arrived from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Thursday to replace those demolished at <LOCATION> Carraizo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION>, which provides water to much of the capital of 1.1 million people. He one of the five motors would be installed by Friday morning and would begin distributing water to the capital on a rationing basis. By Monday, the authority expected to have water service restored to 80 percent of the island, which has a population of 3.3 million. Many hospitals in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> metropolitan area cut back services because of water shortages, and at least two, <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jorge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, stopped admitting patients Wednesday. At <ORGANIZATION> Ashford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, personnel worked 36 hours straight to deliver babies and take care of the injured from the hurricane, said <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Millon </PERSON>, the hospital's executive director. `` Everybody's pitching in,'' he said. The hospital had its own water supply and generators, he said. Supermarkets were opened on shortened hours, but bottled water and canned foods were almost impossible to find. There was also shortages of baby food, disposal diapers and milk. `` Yesterday we sold all the water we have,'' said <PERSON> Pilar </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON>, manager of a 7-Eleven. Looters stole the store's cigarettes and liquor after the hurricane broke its front windows. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> said dairies back in operation after being shut down by power outages had agreed to donate 300,000 quarts of milk a day to the needy. Gasoline was also in short supply in some areas. A line of more than a dozen cars waited at one of the few service stations opened in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>.

 New Yorkers prepared Thursday for weekend telethons, fund-raising concerts and church collections to benefit Puerto Ricans left homeless by Hurricane Hugo. A Trump Shuttle plane was to leave Friday morning, laden with tons of supplies, including clothing, air mattresses and water. `` We're going to load it up with as much as we can get on the airplane,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON>, president of Trump Shuttle. City Council President <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, the mayor's adviser for Hispanic affairs, will accompany the shipment. <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, noting the 1.5 million New York-area residents of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> descent, said, `` We are going to strengthen our ties and relieve the suffering for those who are in need. ... In assisting them, we will be assisting our neighbors as well.'' The hurricane destroyed or damaged homes of an estimated 129,000 people on <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Pop music stars were joining in the fund-raising effort, which on Sunday includes a telethon on the Spanish-language network <ORGANIZATION> Telemundo </ORGANIZATION>, a marathon show at a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> theater and a concert at Nassau Coliseum on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` My office has received hundreds of calls, and to my surprise, the majority of calls are from English-speaking people,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benevolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which is coordinating some events. `` We have a saying in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> that you know who your friends are when you are in need,'' he said. `` People without knowing us have come forward and are volunteering to help.

<HEAD>USDA Sees Rising Crop Yields in Next Century</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New projections announced Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> suggest that rising crop yields may reduce the amount of land needed to meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands more than 40 percent by the year 2030. Export needs are expected to increase, but growth in yields of such major crops as wheat, corn and soybeans will more than keep pace. That will result in less land needed for crops. The new projections were included in a 280-page appraisal of the nation's soil and water resources ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the Resource Conservation Act of 1977. In its first RCA appraisal published in 1981, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> analysts said that almost 390 million acres would be required by 2030. By comparison, slightly more than 380 million acres were used for crops in 1982, the base year for the new projections. Under `` intermediate'' conditions assumed in the latest study, cropland acreage in 2030 is projected to be slightly less than 220 million acres. `` The differences in the two projections of acreages needed do not result primarily from differences in projected demand -LRB- for commodities -RRB-,'' the report said. `` In fact,'' it continued, `` for the major crops _ corn, sorghum, soybeans and wheat _ projections of quantities needed are higher in the second appraisal than in the first, largely because projected export demands are higher.'' The report said that domestic use of some grains in 2030 may be lower than anticipated previously because of improvements in livestock feeding efficiency and much greater use of pasture and forage. Also, per capita projections of red meat consumption are lower in the new appraisal. But the main reason for the differences in the amount of cropland that will be required in 2030 stems from the projected rates of crop yields. For example, in the first appraisal, average corn yields in 2030 were projected at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> average of 144 bushels per acre. The 1989 harvest is currently estimated at 112.4 bushels per acre. The new appraisal puts 2030 corn yields at 198 bushels per acre. Sorghum would go to 127 bushels per acre, compared with 67 projected in the first appraisal and this year's average of 62.6 bushels. Wheat would go to 70 bushels per acre from 42 projected earlier and this year's average of 32.9. Soybean yields were projected at 69 bushels per acre, compared with 45 earlier and 32 this year. `` The assumptions about yield increases mirror the vastly changed view of the future that has developed during the past decade,'' the report said. `` In the early 1970s, many studies indicated that productivity was increasing more slowly than in preceding decades.'' At that time, it appeared to researchers that `` without significant technological breakthroughs and increased investment in research and extension programs, the rate of growth in productivity will probably continue to decline.'' But later research `` provided a basis for greater optimism,'' the report said. In scientific meetings in 1982 and in 1986, a view developed favorable to continued technological progress in crop and livestock production as well as in conservation of the nation's resources

 <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Grace </PERSON>, who headed a presidential commission on government costs in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, called on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Thursday to name a `` waste czar'' to lead a campaign against waste of public money. `` We are in a crisis situation, and nothing less than a war on waste, with the full support of every taxpaying American, will stop <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' wasteful spending,'' <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` To lead the war on waste, I am calling for the appointment of a waste czar, reporting directly to the president,'' he said. Grace, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was chairman of the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control, also known as the <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, from 1982 until the commission reported to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984.

Grace noted that the federal debt stood at $ 1.6 trillion when he last spoke to the press club in early 1984, shortly after his commission's report was presented. `` Now I'm back, five years later, and the federal debt stands at $ 2.9 trillion, or nearly double what it was in 1984,'' he said. He said the waste czar should be given a mandate to carry out the recommendations of his commission as well as cost-saving recommendations of the congressional <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and government inspectors general. `` We do n't need more taxes.

<TEXT>
 A state appeals court Thursday threw out the theft-by-extortion conviction of former congressman and <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> administration aide <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>, saying political arm-twisting does n't constitute an illegal act. In a 3-0 ruling, the midlevel <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said it did not approve of <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>'s conduct but feared it could have `` a chilling effect'' on politics if the hardball tactics that <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> used were considered a crime. <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> was convicted April 7, 1988, after prosecutors said he had tried to `` extort'' a vote from state parole board member <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. He was accused of threatening <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> with the loss of an outside job unless <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> voted Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s way in an administrative matter. Just three days before <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> was convicted, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a first-term Republican, was removed from office by the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members concluded <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> misused money in a state protocol fund and obstructed justice by trying to thwart an investigation of allegations that one of his aides had threatened another aide. The allegations were unrelated to the <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> case. <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>, who served five terms in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before resigning in an ultimately unsuccessful bid for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1976, said Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> had singled him out unfairly when he brought the extortion charge. `` Everybody has forgotten that I was very critical of the size and the ineffeciencies that the attorney general's office had created,'' he said. `` It's the most expensive attorney general's office in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and we have the second highest rate of crime in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> It's crazy.'' `` He was after me not because of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> added. `` He was after me because I was a threat to the department.'' <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> was away from his office and unavailable for comment immediately. Aides said they had not decided whether to appeal to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, but they criticized the appeals court's decision `` It's bad public policy to say that an independent official can be threatened with financial harm,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Twist </PERSON>, <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>'s chief deputy <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>, 60, was the only <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> administration offical convicted of any administration-related crime. Thursday's reversal was issued only hours before the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was to start hearing arguments on whether <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment and ouster should be overturned. Writing for a three-judge panel, Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Claborne </PERSON> said the theft-by-extortion statute was `` unconstitutionally vague'' because it does n't spell out clearly enough what is to be considered illegal and because it permits `` arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.'' `` Certainly we do not condone in any way <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>'s conduct,'' <PERSON> Claborne </PERSON> added. The court said an executive assistant to a governor must sometimes issue strong orders to carry out the governor's policy, even by suggesting that underlings could lose their jobs if they did n't comply. Many of the changes that <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> was trying to make at the board have been made since then under the administration of Gov. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, who was elevated from her elected post as secretary of state after <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment. <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> was fined and placed on probation after his <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> conviction and ordered by Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinstein </PERSON> to perform public service work for the State Bar of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. He completed the public service work even before the appeal was decided.

 At least 780 white men have vowed not to perform mandatory military service in the largest defiance ever of national conscription laws, draft resistance leaders said Thursday. The military said legal action would be taken against anyone who failed to report for service. Leaders of the End Conscription Campaign released names of the conscientious objectors at news conferences in six cities. Organizers said the protest was part of a nationwide defiance campaign waged by anti-apartheid groups since early August. As part of the campaign, about 9,000 people of all races staged an anti-government march in <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION>, one of many mass demonstrations staged since President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said his government will allow peaceful protests. Police said when the crowd dispersed there was stonethrowing, several shop windows were broken and goods valued at several thousand dollars were looted from stores. Police said no one was arrested and there were no injuries reported. Several major protests have taken place without incident since then, but Justice Minister <PERSON> Kobie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coetsee </PERSON> said the trouble in <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION> `` can in no way be compared with peaceful and orderly protests and will not be tolerated.'' In the nearby port of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, police arrested 38 high school students and teachers when they broke up a march of about 400 mostly black people protesting the acquittal of a black civic leader charged with murdering a schoolboy. Riot police in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> turned back several hundred students from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION> who wanted to march to a local police station to protest the detention of fellow students. Teachers and students in mixed-race areas of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> held several demonstrations, but no incidents were reported. In <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, Chief Justice <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON> swore in the new Cabinet a day after <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s inauguration. A pro-government Afrikaans newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Beeld </ORGANIZATION>, said in a front-page story the Cabinet probably will decide within a week or so on the possible release of <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> and other jailed leaders of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is serving a life sentence since his 1962 conviction for sabotage. The draft resisters include many who have yet to be drafted and others who have completed their two-year training but say they will not attend mandatory call-up camps. `` We are not prepared to serve in a racist defense force to uphold a racist system,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON>, a lawyer and acting chairman of the End Conscription Campaign. The military said it will take legal action against those who fail to report for service. Military service is mandatory for all able-bodied white men unless they qualify as religious objectors or win delays, for example to attend college. Draft resisters face jail terms of up to six years, and several men have been sentenced in the past two years, including two who received the maximum penalty. A press statement said the new draft resisters included professors, clergymen, executives and engineers. `` We will respond to the call-up in different ways,'' the statement said. `` Some will go to jail. Others will opt for religious objector status. Many of us will choose between a life in exile or constant evasion of call-ups.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON>, a former army lieutenant, urged the government to introduce a non-military alternative for political objectors. The government does not release information on the manpower of the armed forces. But an estimated 68,000 conscripts are on active duty and about 325,000 men are in the reserves at any one time. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 28-million black majority has no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites, about half male, control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Schools, Social Service Agencies Should Coordinate Efforts: Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Children who are hungry, sick or homeless are poor learners, a study by a private educational group said Thursday, calling for greater coordination between schools and social service agencies. The <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said the study found that changing demographics and lifestyles of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families have created problems that schools alone can not solve. Only 6 percent of families are the so-called traditional ones with a breadwinner father, housewife mother and two children in public schools, said the report. Forty percent of the nation's poor are children, 15 million children are being raised by a single parent and 2 million children live with neither parent. The study, entitled `` The Same Client: The Demographics of Education and Service Delivery Systems,'' said the average income for female-headed households with children is only $ 11,200. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodgkinson </PERSON>, director of the group's Center for Demographic Policy and the author of the report, also pointed to limited transportation options for the poor _ such as having to travel by bus and subway to get to work, day care and school _ and the lack of low-income housing _ 8 million low-income renters competing for 4 million housing units _ as creating great hardships, particularly for working mothers. As for health care, <PERSON> Hodgkinson </PERSON>, a former director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, said 11 percent of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s school children are enrolled in special classes for the handicapped. Roughly one-third of these children, he said, would have a smaller handicap, or none at all, if adequate medical care had been provided during pregnancy and in infancy. `` It is painfully clear that a hungry, sick or homeless child is by definition a poor learner, yet schools usually have no linkage to health or housing organizations outside those run by the schools themselves,'' said the report. `` At a time when service organizations are increasingly strapped financially, this kind of interactive organization holds promise ... It may well be that with few increases in funding, we could still magnify the effectiveness of each dollar several times through programs based on interagency collaboration at each governmental level.'' <PERSON> Hodgkinson </PERSON> said that in recent years, there has been more dialogue among government agencies with the same function, but one outcome has been `` organization maintenance, not improved services.'' `` For the urgent problems we face, this is not enough. Service organizations must begin to see their interdependence across functional lines,'' he said.

<HEAD>Teen Loses $28,000 Prize for Allegedly Using Same Steer in Two Competitions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A girl whose steer won first prize at the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> State Fair must forfeit the $ 28,000 because the animal's hide had been dyed, allegedly to mask that it had been entered under a different name in another fair. The <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Expositions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the fair, approved an agreement reached with the family of 17-year-old <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shealy </PERSON>, whose steer named <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> won the prize in August. The family admits to no wrongdoing, but the girl will not get her prize money and must give up her first-place ribbon. She and her family also were barred from competition for five years. `` The message is not to cheat at the livestock show at the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> State Fair,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Foust </PERSON>, general manager of the fair. <PERSON> Foust </PERSON> said officials could not prove suspicions that <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> had also been shown under the name <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Iroquois </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fair </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> in July _ a violation of the rules. But, he said investigators for the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> fair found that a white spot on <PERSON> Hank </PERSON>'s belly had been dyed black, which is also against the rules <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> officials did not have nose prints of <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> to compare with those of <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> taken at the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> fair, <PERSON> Foust </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> was the second-prize steer at the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> fair. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON>, a 1,245-pound Angus-cross steer, had been impounded at an <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> barn while investigators waited for his hair to grow out. The <PERSON> Shealy </PERSON> family picked him up on Thursday. `` We're happy <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> is strict, but I wish <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> was as strict as <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, because if they were we'd have nose prints and could prove that they're two separate steers and we'd get you people off our back,'' said a boy who identified himself only as a family member when reached at the Shealy's home. The agreement was reached two weeks ago. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON>'s credentials came into question when fair officials received a tip from an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> extension agent on Aug. 19 that <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> might be <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>, named reserve champion at the <LOCATION> Iroquois </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fair </LOCATION> in Illionois on July 24. Investigators said black dye had been used to cover a swirl of white hair on <PERSON> Hank </PERSON>'s belly. A similar white patch can be seen in a photograph of <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>. Fair rules prohibit misrepresentation of an animal's history or ownership and forbid any alterations in an animal's natural appearance. Under the rules of both fairs, an exhibitor also must have owned the animal since Jan. 1 of the year in which it is shown. The agreement states that the Shealys exhibited <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> `` based upon a misunderstanding created by advice provided a professional groomer. ... <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shealy </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Shealy </PERSON> family believed that certain coloring or shading of <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> the steer was fair and appropriate to successfully present <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> the steer for competition.'' The groomer was not identified. <PERSON> Foust </PERSON> said that, under state fair rules, there will be no grand champion this year. The family of 12-year-old <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, who exhibited <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> fair, has denied any wrongdoing. They said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> was destroyed after the fair. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Perzee </PERSON>, chairman of the Illinois fair, could not be reached for comment Thursday. Telephone calls to him were not answered. The $ 28,000 was the highest bid made for <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> at the state fair's Sale of Champions on Aug. 14 <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Link </PERSON> of Fremond-based Link Carnivals bid the money. Link was on the road in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and not available for comment.

<HEAD>Pravda Apologizes for Article on Yeltsin</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with action to be taken against two
prosecutors who accused Ligachev of misconduct, details. No pickup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda printed a rare public apology Thursday for a report that claimed political maverick <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> had gone on a boozing and buying spree in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In another case involving public criticism of an official, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the party plans action against two prosecutors who accused hard-line Politburo member <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> of misconduct. In its apology for the <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> report, <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said the reporter who wrote the story had not seen anything of the kind. A legislative committee created to serve as a watchdog for the state media said the account of <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s purported American binge smacked of the `` gutter press'' and was unacceptable. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> called the piece `` garbage.'' The lengthy expose appeared Monday in Pravda. It was originally published by the Italian newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION> and said the Soviet legislator left behind in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` a wake of catastrophic prophecies, insane expenses, interviews and above all the perfume of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> Black Label.'' The Pravda article was picked up by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> and distributed nationwide. Regional newspapers carried it in full. A flushed and angry <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who returned home Monday from a nine-city <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour, accused Pravda of seeking `` revenge for the fact that Americans received us with admiration.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily said Thursday it had instructed its <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> correspondent, <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Linnik </PERSON>, to contact the <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION> reporter who wrote the original article, <PERSON> Vittorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucconi </PERSON>, and check its accuracy. `` Asked whether he stood by the authenticity of everything he wrote about B.N. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> in his article, <PERSON> Zucconi </PERSON> replied he had based it on secondary sources, on a publication that appeared in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> Sept. 13 headlined ` With Drunken Embraces Toward The Capitalists' and the testimony of Soviet emigres who heard talk of <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s conduct in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>,'' Pravda said. The Pravda editorial board offered its apologies to <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> but appeared to do so only grudgingly. The reprint of La Repubblica story's was promoted on the front page with excerpts saying <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> found the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` a holiday, a stage, a bar 5,000 kilometers long.'' The apology was on the bottom of page 7. Members of the media watchdog committee _ the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glasnost </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Rights _ accused Pravda of deliberately drawing a biased picture of <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, a deputy in the Supreme Soviet. The Pravda report apparently did little to dull public enthusiasm for <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who revels in his role as an anti-establishment gladiator fighting for a better life for average Soviets, though he himself is a member of the elite <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. On Wednesday night, about 10,000 people rallied in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Zelenograd </LOCATION> to show support for <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and for the two prosecutors who have made claims of corruption by <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> and other high party officials. In its report on the prosecutors Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> directed its <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> organization to take action against the two prosecutors, <PERSON> Telman </PERSON> <PERSON> Gdlyan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>. The two publicly accused <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s archrival in the Soviet leadership, of involvement in corruption cases they were investigating. However, the Soviet procurator-general's office cleared <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not say what type of action would be taken against the two prosecutors, who have themselves been under investigation on charges that they forced confessions during their inquiry. During his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> warned Americans that President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could face a revolution if he fails to improve living conditions soon. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, was stripped of that post almost two years ago by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who denounced him as politically immature and overly ambitious. In a remarkable political comeback in March, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> won 89 percent of the vote when he ran against an establishment candidate to represent <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the new national legislature, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>.

 When <PERSON> Kacey </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisyk </PERSON> walked around <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> assembly plant, no one recognized her. Perhaps if she's just hummed a few bars ... <PERSON> Cisyk </PERSON> is the voice behind <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Have You Driven a Ford ... Lately'' jingle that's been part of the company's advertising campaign for eight years. The company estimates that her voice has been heard 20 billion times in a variety of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> advertisements since 1981. Since then, she's also done commercials for <ORGANIZATION> Classic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and Princess Cruises.

A couple of months later, she was told that someone at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> wanted to meet her. `` Honestly, at that time I did n't know who he was,'' she said of the executive who's now the company chairman. `` But we talked for several hours about music.

 Mules _ the uncelebrated offspring of a donkey and a horse _ have no pride of ancestry nor hope of posterity.

<HEAD>Cable TV Better Than Critics Think, Cable Executive Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite its problems, cable television has a lot to crow about, a cable executive said Thursday in urging his colleagues to fight back against widespread `` cable-bashing.'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON>, saying `` there is no shortage of cable-bashing going on in the world today,'' told a cable convention it was time for operators to `` stand up for cable and for what cable has achieved.'' He said there were 51 million cable homes today, compared with 21 million in 1981, `` not because they have to be _ they're cable homes because they want to be,'' thanks to an upsurge in first-run programming featuring big-name stars since cable was deregulated in 1984. <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> spoke to the Great Lakes Exposition cable convention in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. A copy of his speech was released from <ORGANIZATION> NCTA </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> reminded his audience that many cable programs are highly praised by TV critics and that a recent <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> poll showed the public believes that cable cultural, children's, sports and general entertainment programming is superior to that found on broadcast TV. `` Is it any wonder then that most people _ voting with their wallets _ think an average of $ 14.50 a month for over 30 channels of basic cable is a good buy?'' he said. A <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last month said the average cable bill, including premium services, went up 14 percent during the first 23 months after 1984 rate deregulation to $ 24.68. <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> said that increase was `` significant but hardly unreasonable'' and that the price hikes had abated this year. `` According to the government's Consumer Price Index for this year, cable bills from January through August went up only 1.4 percent, less than half the the overall CPI,'' <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> said. `` Clearly, what happened during the first 23 months of deregulation was an adjustment, and today we're back on track.'' But a host of bills are pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would reregulate cable as lawmakers react to constituent complaints about poor cable TV service and increased rates. In the face of such criticism, <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> said it was important for cable operators to `` let people know the value of what they're getting'' and also to `` pay very serious attention ... to good customer service. He said the Cable Act required cable systems to dedicate more channels for public, educational and governmental access and that increases in cable franchising fees had fattened municipal coffers by more than $ 3 billion since 1984. `` We've got to tell our story,'' <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> said. `` We've changed the way people spend their leisure hours; we've done for television in 15 years what the broadcasters could n't do in 30. We've got a great story to tell, and if we tell it effectively, a great future.''

<HEAD>East Germany Declares Reform Group Illegal</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The communist East German government declared a newly formed pro-democracy group illegal on Thursday and accused the organizers of `` anti-state policies'' and attempts to deceive the public about its true aims. A statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and carried by the state <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency formally rejected an application to legalize the Neues Forum -LRB- New Forum -RRB- opposition group. Neues Forum was established two weeks ago by 30 East Germans pushing reform of the hard-line government under ailing, 77-year-old <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. In a conflicting high-level signal, Deputy Culture Minister <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoepcke </PERSON> demanded a state probe into why thousands of young East Germans are leaving their homeland for the West. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> youth newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Junge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Hoepcke </PERSON> told students and teachers at an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> art college that authorities should investigate and correct the social problems prompting the exodus. About 18,000 East Germans fled to the West through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> opened its border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> on Sept. 10 to those refusing to return to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Legal emigration from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is also at record levels, with more than 80,000 permitted to leave by early September. West German officials earlier predicted about 100,000 East German arrivals for 1989, but now say the number could reach 200,000. Bolstered by the widely publicized refugee tide, reformers organized Neues Forum to press the leadership for change. But East German Communists are likely to be more resistant to reforms than their <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Without a communist government, the nation would have little cause to exist as a state separate from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hoepcke </PERSON> called for news media reforms and more dialogue between the East German leadership and its citizens. On Wednesday, another prominent politician, <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON>, had questioned whether the leadership should rethink its positions in view of the decision by so many `` children of the revolution'' to abandon <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for the West. The main party daily <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> has ignored suggestions that reforms be considered. The ministry statement Thursday said Neues Forum's request for legalization had been received, reviewed and rejected. `` The aims and concerns of the proposed organization contradict the constitution of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and present anti-state policies,'' it said. `` The signature drive for support of formation of the organization was not allowed and is therefore illegal. It is an attempt to deceive the citizens of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> about the true intentions of the authors.'' In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> told reporters Thursday he will meet next week with East German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Oskar </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> to discuss the refugee problem and conditions in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. They will be in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session.

Meanwhile, <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON>, staff director of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee investigating the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> scandal, said subpoenas ordering former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> to appear before the panel were being formally served with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s lawyers late Thursday. The subcommittee voted unanimously Tuesday to subpoena <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> to testify on at least three occasions, the first next Tuesday, as part of the congressional investigaiton into the department's problems. <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s attorneys had agreed to accept the subpoenas on behalf of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. Payments to five consultants not identified in previous reports were discovered during a follow-up investigation by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> auditors. Those payments totaled $ 128,000, a relatively small amount compared to the huge fees paid to more prominent consultants. All of the $ 6 million in consulting fees were paid since late 1983 by developers seeking subsidies from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program. It was an April audit of that program that triggered the current congressional, internal and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigations of fraud, mismanagement and influence peddling at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The April audit identified $ 4.2 million in fees paid to consultants and said those lobbyists, some former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials and other prominent Republicans with little or no experience in housing, appeared to win special treatment from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials. At an August hearing, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said his investigators had discovered additional payments that brought known consultant fees to $ 5.7 million, and in a report sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel this week <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said the total had grown to $ 6 million. <PERSON> Kitchin </PERSON>, southeastern regional director for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidential campaigns, received $ 90,000 more than had been known just last month, bringing his total from $ 25,000 to $ 115,000, the report said. The first $ 25,000 was for his work on a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> project <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> approved over the objection of several agency experts. And auditors uncovered an additional $ 800 paid to <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is no relation to the president but served as a top aide to then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and as well as treasurer of his presidential campaign. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in line to be <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> but withdrew him name from consideration earlier this month after it became clear his work as a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> consultant had doomed his chances of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. The new report also put a price tag on the effect of the 1983 decision to abandon a `` fair share'' financing formula, which distributed <ORGANIZATION> Moderate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> funds to based on local housing needs and ability to administer the program. Instead, spending decisions became discretionary and were made at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, a change auditors have concluded opened the door for influence peddling. Of $ 3.1 billion spent on the program from October 1983 through September 1988, about 40 percent, or $ 1.2 billion, was `` misallocated when compared to the fair share percentages,'' the report said.

 A three-year, $ 35.4 billion authorization bill for the nation's space programs was passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Thursday with only 14 dissenting votes. It authorizes <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to spend $ 12.8 billion in the year beginning Oct. 1, some $ 2 billion more than in the current year.

The bill, approved 398-14, also authorizes $ 9.3 billion for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> programs in 1991 and $ 13.3 billion in 1992. The 1990 authorization is $ 648 million less than asked by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. In 1990, the bill authorizes spending $ 127 million to continue work on an aerospace plane, the so-called `` Orient Express,'' which would be capable of flying from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in four hours. Supporters say the technology developed for such a plane is crucial to keep the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the forefront of aviation.

 Thousands fled <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s barrier islands and parts of its coastline Thursday, but Hurricane Hugo's new northward path offered hope that the state would be spared its full force. `` I think we escaped the brunt,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Glynn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> emergency operations spokesman, after the center of the storm was 200 miles east of <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> coast could expect winds of 40 to 50 mph, near tropical storm strength but far short of the fury closer to <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s center. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said flooding was expected, `` but hopefully we're looking at less damage.'' Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> GEMA </ORGANIZATION> opened shelters and advised about 142,000 people, more than 95,000 of them in <LOCATION> Chatham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, to leave their homes. By mid-afternoon, <LOCATION> Tybee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> on the north end of the coast and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Simons </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to the south were virtual ghost towns of boarded-up buildings. The only open business on <LOCATION> Tybee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> appeared to be <PERSON> Nickie </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Lounge </LOCATION>, where a handful of holdouts gathered. As he sipped a drink, 63-year-old island resident <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowell </PERSON> scoffed at the idea of heading for <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>. `` I do n't go in there even when the weather's good,'' he said. Authorities said they would cut off electricity to <LOCATION> Tybee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> at 6 p.m., and police prevented most vehicles from entering the island. Gov. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> declared a state of emergency in six coastal counties. `` It is imperative that citizens heed the warnings to flee low-lying areas and the barrier islands,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said in a statement. Many did n't need much prompting. Hotels and motels were booked to capacity in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, not far up the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from the northern barrier islands of <LOCATION> Tybee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Skidaway </LOCATION>, and further inland at least as far as <LOCATION> Statesboro </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hinesville </LOCATION>. Most of <PERSON> Tybeee </PERSON>'s 4,500 residents fled across a causeway to <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, and many were n't stopping there. Bumper-to-bumper traffic stretched at least 30 miles inland from <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>. Many of the vehicles were towing boats. But about 25 surfers lingered. One of them, <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, said he would be moving to his parents' house _ on higher ground than his beach house, but still on the island. `` It's fun,'' <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said of the surfing. `` I think tomorrow it will be better.'' Others fled low-lying areas on the mainland, especially people living in mobile homes. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, with two young daughters in tow, stocked up on bottled water and canned goods at a supermarket. She said she feared the hurricane would topple her mobile home. `` I'm not experienced with hurricanes, but after looking at it on television I do n't want to stand here and take my chances,'' Ms. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said. She said she did n't know where she would go. Shelters were opened in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> and further inland. The biggest ones were at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Statesboro </LOCATION>, with room for 15,500, and the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, where officials said nearly 19,000 could be housed. Coastal school systems canceled class for the rest of the week. Forecasters expected the storm to turn north after striking land, lessening the danger to historic structures in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, which was founded in 1733 as one of the nation's first planned communities. The barrier islands _ <LOCATION> Tybee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Simons </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jekyll </PERSON> and others _ also are rich in history. They hold wilderness areas and luxury resorts, the graveyards of former slaves and the ruins of once-prosperous rice and cotton plantations.

<HEAD>GAO Report Sees Problems in Veterans' Housing Loan Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A veterans' housing loan program is having financial problems because of high foreclosures and may require more aid than the Veterans Affairs Department has requested, according to a government audit. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> audit covered the department's financial statements for 1987 and'88, but made special note of <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s housing loan `` The primary cause of the loan guaranty fund's increased need for funding beyond that generated through normal operations was the weakened financial condition of certain sectors of the economy, particularly energy and agriculture,'' according to the report released this week. The loan guaranty fund guarantees a portion of private sector loans made to eligible veterans at special terms. About 13 million veterans have taken advantage of VA housing programs. The fund largely paid its ways through the 1970s, but its requirement for appropriations and money transfers `` has increased significantly since 1980.'' The fund required $ 900 million in transfers and appropriations in 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. Congress and the VA are making several efforts to address the issue, and <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> says the problem is lessening because of a decline in foreclosures. <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> had 44,693 home loan foreclosures in fiscal 1987 and 48,963 in fiscal 1988, the report said. Foreclosures totaled 38,721 in the first 10 months of this fiscal year, said <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>. `` We expect further improvements ... and we expect the numbers to continue to decrease,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> says the fiscal year appropriation for the fund was $ 778 million, with $ 120 million of that in supplemental funds,. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report says <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> will need about $ 100 million in tranfers from the direct loan fund plus about $ 453 million in additional direct appropriations in fiscal 1990. The direct loan fund is a separate fund used for direct mortgage loans to severely disabled veterans. The report noted several possible influences that would change <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s estimates: _ A higher foreclosure rate than <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s projection _ The continued sale, without-recourse, of loans on properties aquired by VA through defaults When VA finances foreclosed property sales, it can package several loans for sale to an investor. The sale with recourse guarantees that <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> will make good on any future default. Without recourse means the investor can not go against VA. The without-recourse loans, though supposedly providing less liability, provide less cash at time of sale, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> says. A law will prevent VA from making without-recourse sales after Sept. 30, but <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> is proposing legislation to give it flexibility in determining which types of loans to sell. _ A `` significant lapse'' of <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s authority to collect a 1 percent funding fee on loans. The last time there was such a lapse _ six weeks in 1988 _ <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 30 million, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said.

 House Democratic leaders struggled Thursday to sell party members on a deficit-reduction plan whose key element is a multibillion-dollar tax increase for the nation's 600,000 richest taxpayers. But there was no rush by rank-and-file Democrats to embrace the proposal, aimed at staving off President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to cut the tax on capital gains. The Democratic alternative has a capital-gains break of its own. `` This is an awful plan,'' Rep. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, a member of the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said of the proposal. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to give big tax breaks to the rich, and we want to give them to the near-rich.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., defended the plan, which includes tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts for all workers, as fair and sound `` There is very substantial positive reaction to this proposal,'' he said. Ways and Means Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., who would be expected to manage the Democratic alternative in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said after a closed meeting with party whips: `` There's not too much unity here. Also attending that meeting was <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who recently cautioned party lawmakers against repeatedly calling for tax increases in the face of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s no-tax-increase pledge White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> complained that expanding IRAs `` amounts to a tax increase.'' `` If you institute a proposal that reduces revenue, the government deficit gets larger and leaves you with even more pressure for a tax increase,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. House Republican Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> told colleagues that he was `` absolutely amazed that liberal Democrats would rush into a tax-increase fight after the lessons of 1984 and 1988,'' when Democratic presidential candidates portrayed as favoring higher taxes were swamped. The Democrats' still-emerging plan is intended as a substitute for the capital-gains tax cut that Republicans and six maverick Democrats pushed through Ways and Means last week. The cut, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsed, is part of the committee's deficit-reduction plan. Democratic leaders note estimates that 80 percent of the benefit of the capital-gains reduction would go to those with annual incomes over $ 200,000. After briefly accelerating revenues, they contend, it would deepen the budget deficit in 1992 and beyond. As an alternative, Democratic leaders proposed: _ Expanding IRAs so all workers, regardless of income, could have a deductible plan The money could be withdrawn without penalty to finance the down payment on a first home or for college education. _ Eliminating a quirk in the 1986 tax overhaul in a way that would raise taxes on the richest 600,000 couples and individuals The quirk requires some upper-middle-income Americans to pay a higher rate of tax on part of their earnings than applies to the wealthiest taxpayers. Under that law, for example, a single person with $ 75,000 taxable income pays a top rate of 33 percent on a $ 10,000 pay raise or investment windfall. But a $ 250,000-a-year earner pays only 28 percent tax on a similar increase in income. The Democratic plan would apply the 33 percent rate to all taxable income above $ 44,900 for a single person and to all above $ 74,850 for a couple. _ Assuring that the 33 percent rate would not apply to any capital-gains income Thus, the maximum tax on capital gains, which for some upper-middle-income people is 33 percent, would be cut to 28 percent. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa., who as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip is the Democrats' chief vote-counter, called the proposal `` a continuation of the simplification of the tax code'' that would encourage saving and investment Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., said the plan gives the party a chance to stand for something, rather than just oppose the capital-gains cut The capital-gains reduction has drawn little public response, he said, but `` the mere mention of IRAs caused the phone to ring.'' Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., calling any capital-gains cut a blow against deficit reduction, said there would be `` a large group of us that will vote against any kind of change. `` I think it's a mistake for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to be advocating an increase in taxes until the president has done that,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga., chief sponsor of the capital-gains cut that won Ways and Means approval

 The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday many of its 1990 objectives for a healthier nation wo n't be met, but said the agenda for the next decade calls for a longer life expectancy and a reduction in infant mortality. Substantial progress can be made in the 1990s also in areas like obesity, where little improvement was made in last 10 years, said Dr. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> and Health Promotion. `` We know more now about what the risk groups are,'' he said. Areas where goals for 1990 apparently will not be reached are immunization of children before age 2 and flu vaccinations for high-risk populations, the Atlanta-based national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The report referred to a draft of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Year 2000 Objectives for the Nation,'' released Thursday. Tentative targets for the next decade include cutting the percentage of adult smokers in half, to about 15 percent, and reducing infant mortality from 10.4 infant deaths per thousand in 1986 to no more than seven. Other goals include raising life expectancy from 74.9 years to at least 78 and increasing years of healthy life to 65 years from an estimated 60 in 1987. `` Smoking is a good example,'' said <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON>, a deputy assistant secretary for health based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` It's accountable for 390,000 deaths a year. It's an example of where we can target low income and minority populations, where the most difficult challenges lie.'' <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> said that for goals to be reached, every sector of society must get involved. `` The most important component is the work of voluntary organizations,'' he said. `` We have to have leadership at the state and local levels.'' In the area of infant mortality, <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> said: `` It has been said that one of the truest measures of civilization is the care society gives its children. We have had a 35 percent reduction in infant mortality since the 1970s when the -LRB- 1990 -RRB- goal was set.'' He said infant mortality is an area where `` progress has been reasonably good, but we need to target areas where the population is most vulnerable. We have not been able to close the gap between blacks and whites and have missed the target for 1990 of reducing the rate for blacks.'' The service listed 21 areas for improvement by the year 2000. `` We ought to be able to anticipate progress in each of them,'' <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> said. `` The biggest challenge will be in the area of violent and abusive behavior.'' The 21 areas include: nutrition; physical activity and fitness; tobacco, alcohol and other drugs; sexual behavior; violent and abusive behavior; vitality and independence of older people; environmental health; occupational safety and health; and unintentional injuries. Others are maternal and infant health; immunization and infectious diseases; AIDS; other sexually transmitted diseases; cholesterol and high blood pressure; cancer; other chronic disorders; oral health; mental and behavioral disorders; health education and preventive services; and surveillance and data systems. `` We need to emphasize that these are national goals and not federal goals,'' <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> said. `` Federalizing is not the way to do this. We hope by laying out a common framework we'll be able to focus our collective resources.'' <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that the planning process was not complete and that comment was welcome.

<HEAD>Germany Urged to Charge Ex-SS General with Alleged Atrocities</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A legislator called Thursday for international pressure on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to charge a former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> SS general after a new book alleged <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohnke </PERSON> ordered the massacres of British, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian prisoners of war. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which promised 15 months ago to re-open investigations, announced it would send a government prosecutor to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> next week to examine still-secret government files on the 78-year-old Mohnke. `` The governments -LRB- of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- must either bring enormous pressure on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to charge Mohnke on the facts available or remove his name from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> list of suspected war criminals and explain why,'' legislator <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooker </PERSON> said. He was speaking at a publication party to launch the book, `` <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Last General,'' written by two Nazi era researchers, <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Botting </PERSON>. The book said that evidence in the British files includes death-bed testimony in 1947 by an SS corporal, <PERSON> Oskar </PERSON> <PERSON> Senf </PERSON>, to a war crimes investigator that <PERSON> Mohnke </PERSON> ordered the 1940 killing of 80 to 90 unarmed British prisoners at <LOCATION> Wormoudt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The book also described <PERSON> Mohnke </PERSON> as a `` key link'' in the chain of command during the killing of 72 American prisoners shot at <LOCATION> Malmedy </LOCATION> in the Ardennes on Dec. 17, 1944, and in the shootings of some 35 Canadian prisoners in <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> in June 1944. <PERSON> Mohnke </PERSON> has denied all the charges. The authors published the names of 11 of the 12 SS troopers who, they say, are identified in the secret British files as having herded the captured troops into a barn at <LOCATION> Wermoudt </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Dunkirk </LOCATION>, and mowed them down with gunfire and hand grenades. The authors said three or four of these men were believed to be alive. After World War II, allied investigators entered <PERSON> Mohnke </PERSON>'s name in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> list as one of some 25,000 `` A'' class suspects accused of serious crimes. But <PERSON> Mohnke </PERSON>, who was in <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s bunker in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> when the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> leader committed suicide April 30, 1945, was captured by the Soviets and they refused to extradite him. After 10 years in a Soviet jail, <PERSON> Mohnke </PERSON> was released to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He became a businessman and attracted scant publicity. In 1973, West German prosecutors said they had dropped investigations on grounds there was insufficient evidence. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> asked <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to re-open the inquiry last year after <PERSON> Sayer </PERSON> said he had traced documents showing <PERSON> Mohnke </PERSON> had been sought separately by British, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> investigators. <PERSON> Mohnke </PERSON> told German newspapers he had done nothing wrong, but took no action against <PERSON> Sayer </PERSON> or newspapers that published the claims. Neighbors described <PERSON> Mohnke </PERSON> as a `` nice, quiet, friendly old man.'' `` The West German authorities have grudgingly opened their own investigation but ... the safest refuge on earth for a fugitive Nazi war criminal is <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sayer </PERSON> said Thursday. He added that during the previous West German investigation, the prosecutors never asked to see the British files. They had also never asked to see 70 boxes of files with references to <PERSON> Mohnke </PERSON> held by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Nazi-hunting Office of Special Investigations or the relevant Canadian government records, said <PERSON> Sayer </PERSON>. After the war 77 SS officers and men were convicted of taking part in the massacre of the Americans at <LOCATION> Malmedy </LOCATION> and jailed. <PERSON> Rooker </PERSON>, whose constituents include one of five veterans who survived the Wermoudt massacre, said `` public-spirited'' people had given the authors access to some of the secret files on the Wermoudt massacre. The material has been classified under <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Official Secrets Act as confidential until the year 2021. <PERSON> Rooker </PERSON> said government ministers have told him that this is `` to avoid embarrassment'' _ apparently to relatives of the men of the SS, <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s notorious stormtroopers. <PERSON> Rooker </PERSON>, the authors and the five elderly surviving veterans of the Wormoudt massacre all said Thursday they thought there was scant chance that <PERSON> Mohnke </PERSON> would be prosecuted. `` If anyone wanted to do it, they'd have done it sooner,'' said 76-year-old veteran <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, who survived in the barn, his leg blown off, under a pile of corpses. Next month, legislators are to vote on whether to allow the first war crimes trials in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. A government inquiry this year said there is sufficient evidence to charge three British residents, former nationals of Soviet-occupied territories, with atrocities against Jews.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government announced Thursday it was putting 14 Panamanian companies and individuals on a trade blacklist, including a former presidential candidate supported by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The blacklist prohibits any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company from dealing with the 14, with a possible penalty of 10 years imprisonment or a $ 50,000 fine, or both. The move was announced in a press release by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announcement published in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. It was part of a continuing campaign by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to force the ouster of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who was indicted by two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal grand juries last year in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> holds the real power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> through his command of the Panamanian Defense Forces. Former opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> entered the second day of a hunger strike to back his plea that Panamanians refrain from gambling or playing the lottery in an effort to cut government revenue. International observers say <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> won last May's elections by a 3-to-1 margin, but the Noriega-controlled government nullified that vote and installed a provisional president. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>'s main opponent and a <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> associate, headed the list of individuals and companies residing in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that are banned from doing business with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms. Many Panamanian companies do business with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations such as the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which has military installations in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> with about 14,000 soldiers. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has moved all its personnel on base and restricted off base movement. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> imposed economic sanctions on the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government early last year, freezing its assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and barring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies from paying Panamanian taxes. Canal revenues due to go to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were also frozen. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> blacklist is made up of associates or friends of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and will probably be expanded, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denies the drug charges and says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic help to the political opposition in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> made fair elections impossible. He says moves against him are part of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plot to renege on its obligations to turn the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of the century.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it halted enforcement against a polluting <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> waste-burning plant for more than two years because it did n't want to damage a criminal investigation of the facility. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> action frustrated area parents whose children had a higher-than-usual incidence of cancer, the House Government Operations environment subcommittee was told. The enforcement halt also stymied state officials, who aggressively sought civil penalties against the Marine Shale Processors plant, near <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> officials found air, water and hazardous waste violations at the plant. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, acting assistant <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator for enforcement, said the agency declined to take action under an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which believed that any civil enforcement could lead to dismissal of criminal evidence and other problems. Subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., said there's something `` fundamentally wrong'' with a system that `` allows violations for years to go unabated. `` It's unfair to the community'' to say that a pending criminal investigation means `` we can not protect the safety of people,'' he said. The criminal investigation ran from November 1986, when the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> searched the plant, to last July 24, when the company pleaded guilty to three pollution violations _ one felony and two misdemeanors _ and was fined $ 1 million. The violations involved hazardous waste storage, creating an obstacle to navigation and allowing contaminated storm water to enter a waterway. <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said only an imminent health danger would have changed the policy, and it did n't find one. But Rep. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. `` Billy'' <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., who represents the district where the plant is located, said there is a higher than average rate of child cancer in the area and a state study has tried to determine if the Marine Shale plant is responsible He said there is no conclusive evidence to implicate the facility. <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processors </ORGANIZATION> is located along <PERSON> Bayou </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeuf </PERSON>, part of the heavily traveled Gulf Intercoastal Waterway System. The facility burns hazardous waste, producing a byproduct known as aggregate, which is used as a substitute for gravel in road building. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olde </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an attorney representing the company, said in an interview `` There are no hazardous releases'' from the firm's operation He said the company was not responsible for child cancer in the area, saying he suspected `` chemical companies that have been dumping chemicals all around'' his region of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. `` We're not making hazardous waste. We're trying to clean up hazardous waste,'' he said. `` We make a clean product.'' State officials first discovered pollution violations beginning in August 1985 but were asked by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to place enforcement on hold while the criminal investigation continued, according to <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Megginson </PERSON>, assistant secretary of legal affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION>. The state has has proposed $ 5.5 million in penalties against the plant. Under prodding by <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> acknowledged that the agency only did routine inspections during the criminal probe out of `` concern that the criminal investigation not be interfered with ...'' He admitted the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> lacked hard data on health hazards. `` I find that incredible. You've been telling people for three years there's no imminent helath threat and you have nothing to back that up,'' <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON> told the panel, `` I wish you could have seen the frustration of the families'' who believe <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> `` let them down.'' He said local residents from <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were `` traumatized'' by the lack of action because they could n't get answers to `` why children are dying of cancer.''

<HEAD>Rural Solidarity Leader Proposes New Political Party</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of the farmer's union Rural Solidarity proposed Thursday the creation of a new political party, an action that could splinter the Solidarity movement. Though nominally independent, the farmer's union has battled alongside Solidarity for eight years and backs its new parliamentary coalition. Its initiative to form its own party could augur the breakup of Solidarity into more narrowly defined parties. However, Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> a variety of parties in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was inevitable and that he was not disturbed. He said the proposal `` should be treated naturally In his statement, <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soldarity </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Slisz </PERSON> said the new party should be called Polish Peasants Party-Solidarity. `` It is only the Polish Peasants Party-Solidarity that can abolish monopolies. I believe that -LRB- this party -RRB- will help build a civil society,'' he said in the statement printed in the pro-Solidarity <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. The new party would rival the existing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> criticizes for its long alliance with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its support of collectivation of private farms in the 1950s. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> switched allegiance last month to Solidarity, creating the parliamentary bloc that allowed Solidarity activist <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> to take over as prime minister on Aug. 24. His government is the first East Bloc admiministration led by a non-Communist since the Communists consolidated control of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after World War II. Rural Solidarity members have been unhappy with their role in the new government. The farmers' union received only one post of minister without portfolio in the 24-member Cabinet, despite its long alliance with Solidarity. <PERSON> Slisz </PERSON>'s statement implied criticism of how the new government was formed. He said the countryside viewed `` with astonishment'' recent parliament reshuffles. `` In this situation, after due consideration, I came to the conclusion that it is necessary to establish our own political organization,'' he said. He said that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was not equal to the problems facing <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` Agriculture needs immediate changes. However, it is to delude oneself dangerously to believe that these changes can be effected by the renovated <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>: a Stalinist product established by the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to fight against private farming,'' said <PERSON> Slisz </PERSON>. `` The people who earlier acted against the interests of the countryside will not cure its ills now,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Dominik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwiczak </PERSON> issued a statement read on state television Thursday night saying `` mutual complaints and conflicts do not serve effective action.'' He added, `` One can not blame currently active members of the party for mistakes of 40 years ago.'' He suggested instead that farm leaders of all stripes hold meetings to work out their differences. Earlier Thursday, <PERSON> Slisz </PERSON> told leading Solidarity parliament deputies and senators about the plans for the new party, the state <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. In response to fears that the caucus would break up into factions, <PERSON> Slisz </PERSON> promised that deputies or senators who join the new party will continue to operate as members of the Solidarity caucus.

<HEAD>Investigators Examine Recordings From USAir Plane</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal investigators examined flight data and cockpit voice recorders Thursday in an effort to find out why the pilot aborted takeoff of his <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737. The plane slid into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>; killing two people. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> technicians displayed the recorders for reporters. One machine was still dripping with water; it had been removed from the crash site at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The data recorder measures 70 functions in the airliner and its engines and should quickly provide clues to any problems that might have caused the pilot to put on the brakes and reverse engine thrust before the plane crashed late Wednesday, said board spokesman <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>. The data recorder in the nine-month-old aircraft is state-of-the-art and provides much more information than earlier models, <PERSON> Polock </PERSON> said. The voice recorder was connected to a microphone in the cockpit and should have picked up the last 30 minutes of conversation among pilots and anyone else in the cockpit. Technicians said both of the tapes and recorders appeared to be in good condition. Content of the recorders is generally not made public before 60 days, but preliminary information that may give investigators some idea of any problems that existed could be available right away, <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> said. An investigative team remained at the crash site and other board personnel were attempting to interview passengers and members of the crew in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. According to safety board records, 737s used by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers have been involved in 56 accidents since 1969, when the airliners were first produced. More than 1,700 of the planes have been built with 800 of the newer models on order, said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. A 737 model similar to the one that went off the runway in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> crashed Jan. 8 in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, killing 44 people. Investigators have reached no final conclusion on the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> crash, but they initially said that the pilot shut down his right engine after his left engine malfunctioned, leaving the plane without power. The accident led to inspections for crossed-wires in warning systems in several <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> models. Four of the 737 crashes of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers have involved fatalities. The worst was the Jan. 13, 1982, crash of an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> 737 that plowed into a bridge crossing the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> into downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Seventy-eight people were killed in the accident, which was blamed on the flight crew's failure to ensure that ice had been removed from the wings. An April 28, 1988, the top ripped off of an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 737 in <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, sparking concern over aging and overused airliners. One flight attendant was killed.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> statement calling for a convent at the edge of <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> to be moved has not changed the feelings of local residents who want the nuns to stay. `` This is <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and they -LRB- the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> -RRB- are very far away,'' said an elderly man hoeing vegetables Thursday in the well-tended garden on the convent grounds adjacent to the walls of the former German death camp. `` The nuns need to be here, and nobody has the right to throw Poles off Polish soil,'' said a woman who has worked more than 20 years in a bookstore inside the camp, under the cloister's shadow. All the Poles interviewed seemed wary and refused to give their names. Most said they had not heard of the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> statement in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> Monday. It was not prominently reported in the Polish media. The 14 nuns of the Carmelite order, who in 1984 moved into the abandoned theater used by <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> as a storehouse during World War II, are at the center of a controversy that is straining Catholic-Jewish relations. Monday's <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> statement appeared aimed at persuading the Polish church to reverse its stand and honor a 1987 agreement between church representatives and Jewish leaders to move the convent. Led by Cardinal <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, the primate, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has yet to officially react to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s position <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> met Wednesday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> with a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jewish </LOCATION> leader, and according to the state <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency, `` further prospects surfaced'' for resolving the dispute. Solidarity Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> quietly asked fellow <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> journalist <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkanowicz </PERSON> to help mediate the controversy. <PERSON> Wilkanowicz </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of the monthly Znak in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, said on Thursday the decision to move the convent has been settled `` in principle'' although many logistical and financial problems remain. `` For sure the church in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will make some moves now to solve this problem,'' said <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozlowski </PERSON>, assistant editor of the influential church-linked <ORGANIZATION> Tydgodnik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Powszechny </ORGANIZATION> weekly in nearby <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> and a national legislator. But <PERSON> Kozlowski </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> on Thursday that the feelings of Jews about the convent are `` not very easy'' for the average Pole to understand. Jews and some Christians say the convent, and particularly its large wooden cross, do not belong in a place where 2.5 million Jews were killed during World War II. `` They -LRB- nuns -RRB- are trying to take away our memories and even our cemeteries,'' said <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Samharet </PERSON>, an Israeli guide at the camp Thursday who was accompanying a group of children from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Jewish leaders in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> renewed appeals for the removal of the nuns this spring after the church missed a Feb. 22 deadline, set in the 1987 agreement, to move the convent to a prayer center away from the camp. The prayer center has yet to be built. Meanwhile, relations between Polish Catholics and Jews have deteriorated. Tension escalated in July when a small group of American Jews climbed over the convent fence to try to talk to the nuns. Workers in the convent poured water on the rabbi and his six students and dragged them off the premises. The Carmelites now have hand-lettered signs in English saying `` No trespassing'' and `` Private property'' posted in the grass near their gate. A St. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> patrols the perimeter of the convent. The nuns seem determined to stay. Throughout the afternoon Thursday, several nuns worked in the vegetable garden, tending flower beds or sweeping the front porch of the red brick building. `` We do n't listen to the radio. We do n't read newspapers. We do n't give out information. We only pray,'' said a nun who answered the door at the convent. She then went back inside. There are signs of continuing renovations _ bricks and lumber on the porch and a wheelbarrow and sand on the sidewalk. `` The sisters are not going to move until they have someplace to go, and they do n't have it yet,'' said a nun of another order waiting at a bus stop near the convent entrance. `` If the cloister were inside the camp, then maybe somebody could complain. But they are outside the camp and they are praying for everybody whether they are Christians or Jews,'' said the bookseller.

<HEAD>Study: Day Care May Be Safer Than Home</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Day-care centers may be safer than home for avoiding childhood injuries, a researcher said Thursday, suggesting that injury rates could be lower still with a little more attention to playground hazards. `` Parents have always had the bad news that kids in day-care are at increased risk of infectious disease,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacks </PERSON>, a medical epidemiologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` Here's some good news for a change: they are probably at less risk of injury and death from injury than they are when they're not at day-care,'' he said. Sacks and his colleagues studied 143 injuries among 5,300 children at 71 <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> day-care centers between June 1987 and May 1988. Centers reported any injury that required medical or dental attention to the researchers, whose study is published in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> The researchers said that 3.54 percent of children in day-care could be expected to be injured at the center in a given year. They extrapolated from their data that, if children were to stay at day-care 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, 14 percent would incur an injury. `` A typical injury rate for children in a community in one year is about 35 percent,'' <PERSON> Sacks </PERSON> said. `` That suggests to us that children in child care are probably safer than when they are in the community at large.'' An earlier <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> study reported similar findings. The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> researchers did not specifically study children injured at home, but cited previous research on their injury rates. Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> pediatrician, said although he had n't seen the new study `` there is a certain amount of logic to it.'' `` In a well-supervised day-care center the environment has been looked at for hazards probably more than in the average home,'' said <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, who edited a day-care manual for the American <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION>. `` And many children who are at home do not get the amount of ongoing supervision as a child does in a day-care center,'' he said in a telephone interview. In the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> study, most injuries _ 58 percent _ were caused by falls and 68.5 percent were head injuries, the researchers said. Most injuries, 54 percent, occurred outside, with outside accidents accounting for 76 percent of the most serious injuries, the study said. The high number of playground injuries could be cut with a few simple measures, including the installation of impact-absorbing surfaces, such as wood chips or sand, Sacks suggested. Playgrounds should be examined regularly for possible hazards, such as equipment that is not stable, he said. `` As I drive by playgrounds, I often see staff congregated talking to each other while kids play,'' he said. `` When a kid is on a playground, it's time for heightened supervision, not less.''

 A man was convicted Thursday of snatching a toddler from his mother and using the child to shield himself from gunfire during a wild battle between gangs fighting over drugs. The 3-year-old child, put on the stand by prosecutors last week to show the jury his wounds, is recovering from a bullet that pierced his chest on Feb. 1. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Casseus </PERSON>, 19, was convicted of assault, reckless endangerment and endangering the welfare of a child. He faces five to 15 years in prison when he is sentenced Oct. 10. `` This defendant's crime _ grabbing a little boy from his mother and using him as a shield against flying bullets _ was depraved,'' said District Attorney <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON>. She said her office would seek a stiff sentence. <PERSON> Casseus </PERSON> `` was controlled, but stunned'' by the verdict, defense lawyer <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Sack </PERSON> <PERSON> Felber </PERSON> said. She said she would appeal the verdict. <PERSON> Casseus </PERSON> maintains he was an innocent bystander mistakenly identified by the child's mother, <PERSON> Modesta </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> was pushing one of her children in a baby carriage and had her son, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, walking at her side when the gunfire erupted at a housing project in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. The mother took cover with the children between two parked cars. But <PERSON> Casseus </PERSON>, one of eight youths involved in the gun fight, ran toward them, grabbed <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> and then held him up as a shield. He released <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> only when a bullet went through the boy's chest, penetrating his lungs and grazing his left arm as it exited <PERSON> Casseus </PERSON> was shot in the leg and identified by Ms. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> at a hospital where he and the boy were treated.

<TEXT>
 Weary residents and tourists who arrived here Thursday from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> said they armed themselves with makeshift weapons and watched in horror as looters rampaged through the hurricane-ravaged island. `` The worst stories that you hear, you can believe them,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Curans </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, who was honeymooning with his bride, <PERSON> Patty </PERSON>, when Hurricane Hugo struck. Currans was among 77 people evacuated from the popular tourist retreat by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> aboard a C-130 transport plane that flew into <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> airport. In Grand Rapids, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, two brothers chartered a plane and rescued their parents after receiving a desperate call from them in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>. `` My father managed to get to a boat yesterday and radioed my brother and _ he only was on for a minute _ he said, ` Do whatever you can to get us out of here,' `` said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorrelle </PERSON>. `` My parents were in fear for their lives.'' `` My father said it's total anarchy,'' <PERSON> Sorrelle </PERSON> said. `` The island is completely destroyed.'' She said her parents, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Langlois </PERSON>, had seen a National Guardsman use his gun to break the lock of a jewelry store for looting, and that people were firing rifles from rooftops. <PERSON> Sorrelle </PERSON>'s two brothers, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Langlois </PERSON>, flew to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> late Wednesday, where they chartered a small plane into <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> on Thursday afternoon. Because their plane had eight seats, the brothers also were bringing four other people back to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sorrelle </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> emergency flight carrying some 250 passengers from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> arrived Thursday at about 5 p.m. <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, told of forming a `` dynamic team'' with several dozen others who took refuge in a hotel outside of <LOCATION> Christiansted </LOCATION>. He said they used machetes to sharpen flag poles into spears and blocked roads to the hotels with trees and debris because of fears of potential violence. `` Once it became dark, you really got spooked,'' he said, describing hearing weapons fire. But he and others said they were not threatened by looters. During the long days, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said his group tossed around a coconut-turned-football and taught cribbage to some <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> construction workers. He said they found a cistern with fresh water and ate thawing food from a hotel freezer. National Guardsmen and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> police joined in the looting spree, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` We did n't go out after dark,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` Whatever the storm did n't break, the looters broke. `` It looked like a war zone.'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a concert promoter, said he watched as authorities shot a looter in the leg after several warning shots. Art <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> police officer, said the lawlessness after the hurricane Sunday was `` unbelievable.'' Like <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>'s group, he and guests at their small hotel armed themselves with plastic batons and organized security watches. <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Timi </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, were also on their honeymoon. `` There's nothing left over there,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> said they carried only one small flight bag off the island. They left the rest of the belongings behind, donating some of their clothing to those in need. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said he was looking forward to relaxing after fearing for his life for the past few days. `` I want to get a nice cold beer, sit down and take it easy,'' he said. `` I have n't slept for four days. And then find a flight back to sunny <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>.''

 A visiting West German official said Thursday that more than 500 East Germans are camped out at the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, seeking free passage to the West. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Glotz </PERSON>, head of a visiting West German parliamentary delegation, said many were determined to stay until their demands were met. `` Well over 500 refugees, including 170 children and two pregnant women, are camping out on the embassy grounds,'' <PERSON> Glotz </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. `` There are very many young people ... and there are people who quite strongly say they will not return to -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' the official said. The flood of East Germans emigrating to the West through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> continued Thursday, with 465 crossing into neighboring <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in the previous 24 hours. Austrian border officials said nearly 18,000 East Germans have entered since <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> opened its western border 11 days ago to the emigrants. From <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, the East Germans are heading to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where they are granted automatic citizenship. West German officials said 304 arrived overnight. Most have cited <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s hard-line Communist government as their reason for leaving. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, Deputy Culture Minister <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoepcke </PERSON> was quoted in the youth newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Junge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> as calling for an investigation into the causes of the refugee wave and social changes needed to stem it. About 250 would-be emigrants last week accepted an East German offer of impunity and the chance to apply for legal emigration and left the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> embassy, reducing the number there to about 150. Over the past few days, however, hundreds more have scaled the 6-foot-high fence around the compound. Many were reported to have come to the embassy after having been turned back at the Hungarian border by Czechoslovak authorities. Hard-line <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> has condemned <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for allowing the East Germans to go West. `` Our delegation tried to urge a humanitarian solution'' in talks with Czechoslovak officials and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jaromir </PERSON> <PERSON> Johanes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Glotz </PERSON> said. `` But at this point I can not raise any hopes.'' Many East Germans have told reporters in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that Czechoslovak authorities were trying to prevent them from traveling to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Reports have emerged of people illegally crossing from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> by crashing through road barriers or swimming the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION>. Czechoslovak officials denied the charges. The Hungarian news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> meanwhile said Thursday that East German refugees who left for the West through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> will be able to reclaim hundreds of cars they left behind. It said 200 cars abandoned by refugees were previously returned to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but about 600 cars remain. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said they will be sent to Austrian and West German motor clubs so refugees can recover them.

 A bus crowded with youngsters on their way to school Thursday plunged more than 40 feet into a water-filled pit after being struck by a delivery truck that ran a stop sign. Nineteen students were killed and 64 other people were injured, five critically. Dazed survivors scrambled out of the submerged bus and stood on it, screaming for help. Passers-by dived in 12 feet of water to pull out survivors and the dead trapped in the bus. Four boats, firefighters from six departments and about 10 divers helped in the rescue, as notebooks and school papers floated in the murky water. `` I thought I was going to die,'' <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, 18, said as he stood in front of <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in muddy pants and hospital slippers, with cuts on his face and bruised hands. `` It just filled up with water real quick. `` I opened up a window, took out my sister, took out a couple of friends and it was already full of water, and you could smell the diesel,'' he said. `` They were just trapped. We had to break the glass of the windows to get in,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON>, a diver who pulled seven bodies from the bus. The bus driver had picked up the last of his 80 students en route to nearby <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> when the bus was hit by a soft-drink truck about 7:40 a.m. at an intersection just east of <LOCATION> Alton </LOCATION>, just north of the U.S.-Mexico border. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> and other survivors said the truck driver ran a stop sign and struck the bus, sending it careening off the road about 20 feet and into the gravel pit. The truck remained alongside the road. Truck driver <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said his brakes failed, said Sgt. <PERSON> Israel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacheco </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>. The truck passed a state inspection last week, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> officials said. No charges have been filed against <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. Roads were dry and the weather was clear at the time of the accident. Authorities used a crane to pull the bus from the pit and dragged the pit for victims. Rescuers later called off their search and said no students were missing. All the dead were 12 to 18 years old, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, a public safety spokesman in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. A temporary morgue was set up at a civic building in Mission. Frantic parents rushed to the scene and swamped phone lines at the school and police station. One woman was carried away in an ambulance, hysterical after seeing the bodies of her two daughters pulled from the water, The Monitor in <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION> reported. Another wept as she was told about the death of her child, the newspaper said. `` How can she be dead? She had just gotten on the bus five minutes before,'' the woman said. Students' families met with counselors and school officials at the city's community center. `` It's very somber. The whole city's in shock right now,'' said fire Capt. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>. Students brought by ambulance to <ORGANIZATION> McAllen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> were `` soaked from head to toe, muddy with no shoes,'' said <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON>, a student nurse. Mission school Superintendent <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantu </PERSON> canceled all extracurricular activities for the weekend `` because we've had a tragedy. How can you be cheering at a football game when something like this has happened?'' <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said it was the worst school bus accident in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> history.

 A French air force helicopter helping rescue efforts in hurricane-battered <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION> crashed into the sea, killing six people and leaving three missing, officials said Thursday. The twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION> plunged into the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> on Wednesday night about a half-mile southeast of the outlying island of <LOCATION> Desirade </LOCATION>, said officials in the capital, Point-a-Pitre. The helicopter was evacuating <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berchel </PERSON>, who had suffered head injuries when Hurricane Hugo hit on Sunday, officials said. The other eight people aboard were <PERSON> Berchel </PERSON>'s son, four medical workers, and the helicopter's crew of three, the officials said. They said six bodies were recovered with three missing. Chances were dim that searchers in helicopters and fishing boats would find them alive, the officials said. The cause of the accident was unknown, but witnesses reported hearing loud mechanical noises as the helicopter lifted off from <LOCATION> Desirade </LOCATION>, about six miles east of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>. The helicopter was part of ongoing rescue efforts involving about 3,000 French servicemen assisting civil authorities in coping with the aftermath of Hugo.

 New doubts were raised Thursday over prospects for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's strategy to reduce the $ 1.3 trillion Third World debt burden as delegates from 152 nations began arriving for talks on global economic issues. Questions about world pollution, political upheavals in communist <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the roller coaster ride of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar were all expected to be addressed during the annual meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debt plan, unveiled last March by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, was the major topic on the agenda because resources of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> are crucial to the success of the effort. The administration found itself facing new questions about the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan after three of the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks this week decided to set aside more than $ 4 billion in reserves to cover losses related to Third World loans. <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it was setting aside $ 2 billion to cover loan losses. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the country's third largest bank, had said it was setting aside $ 1.15 billion and <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it was boosting its loan loss reserves by $ 950 million The decisions will translate into big third-quarter losses for all three banks. The increase in loan loss reserves, which are expected to be followed by other banks, came after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the Third World's largest debtor with $ 110 billion in loans outstanding, missed making a $ 1.6 billion interest payment this week Banking analysts cited the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> debt plan as another factor driving banks to boost loan reserves. Under the plan, banks are encouraged to forgive a portion of their loans to debtor countries in exchange for guarantees supplied by the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> that the remaining debt will be repaid. Thus, the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan forces the banks to formally acknowledge that they will receive less than full repayment on their loans. Executives at both <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> cited this as one reason for boosting their loss reserves. Last week, final agreement on debt reduction terms was reached with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the first country to qualify for assistance under the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> strategy. Some banking analysts said they feared that the actions by major banks to boost loan loss reserves could be a signal that these institutions would no longer lend new money to Third World countries. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Getman </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said that so far the only bank that is even considering making new loans to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Litan </PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said the question of new money on the part of commercial banks was a concern and he said it pointed to the need for a commitment of much greater government resources to make the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan work. `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration does n't want taxpayer bailouts for the banks and they seem to equate substantial <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> guarantees as the equivalent of a taxpayer bailout,'' he said. `` But I think you are going to need those kinds of guarantees on both old and new debt in order to move the program forward.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official praised the decisions to boost loan loss reserves as a `` further move to realism by these commercial banks that we welcome'' and denied that the actions represented a threat to continued lending to debtor nations. `` By strengthening their financial position, banks really have more flexibility to participate in a broader range of options, incluidng debt reduction or debt service reduction and new money,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. While both the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> are expected to spend substantial time discussing the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> debt strategy, analysts said they expected little to be committed in the way of increased funding. <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> Managing Director <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> told reporters the Mexican debt package offered encouragement to other debtor nations to push forward with negotiations with their creditor banks. On the issue of assistance to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> told reporters that <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> officials were holding discussions with officials of both countries aimed at providing assistance to support economic reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The problems of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were also expected to be taken up at the meetings. World Bank President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday that he hoped to be able to resume lending to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> soon. Seven loans totaling nearly $ 800 million were suspended in June following the confrontation between Chinese troops and student protesters in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. Before the opening of the formal sessions of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, finance officials of the world's seven richest countries were scheduled to hold talks all day Saturday to review global economic issues. The closed-door meeting, hosted by <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, will likely focus on efforts by the rich nations to stabilize the value of the dollar, which has been rising for most of this year, despite efforts by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies to drive it lower. The rising dollar threatens to derail the administration's effort to lower the huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. A stronger dollar makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods less competitive on overseas markets and invites higher imports.

<HEAD>Woman on Life Support Dies When Electricity Disconnected</HEAD>

 A woman on life support died after a utility company disconnected power to her home instead of the house next door, a company spokesman said Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Neale </PERSON> said an employee was sent to disconnect a customer's service in this <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb because the bill had not been paid However, the employee accidentally turned off the power to the sick woman's home. Service was disconnected about 10 a.m. Tuesday, and a relative notified the power company about a half hour later that power had been cut off and that life-support equipment was in use, <PERSON> Neale </PERSON> said. `` A customer service representative working with the relative immediately initiated a call to dispatch an employee to the home to restore service,'' <PERSON> Neale </PERSON> said. Service was restored by 11:10 a.m. The woman, described as in her late 50s or early 60s, was taken to <ORGANIZATION> Saint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Margaret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hammond </LOCATION>, where she died about 3 p.m. `` We have expressed our sincere regrets and condolences to the customer's family and offered any assistance we can provide,'' <PERSON> Neale </PERSON> said. He said the electric company would pay for any medical or funeral expenses. `` The accidental disconnection of service was a tragic mistake and we take responsibility for it,'' <PERSON> Neale </PERSON> said. The woman's name and medical condition were withheld at the family's request. The woman was not on the company's life support registry, which lists customers who use life support and medical treatment machines in their homes. People on the registry get priority service whenever there is a power outage. Their meters are tagged and service is never shut off, <PERSON> Neale </PERSON> said. `` Because we had no record of the customer's life support equipment, the electric meter was not tagged. Had it been tagged, it would not have been disconnected,'' <PERSON> Neale </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s planned $ 4.8 billion system for jamming enemy radar is `` seriously flawed'' and production of the joint <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> program should be put on hold, a senator charged Thursday. `` I believe we have discovered a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> embarrassment and a potential waste of billions of dollars,'' said Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>. The Airborne Self-Protection <PERSON> Jammer </PERSON>, under development since 1969, is used to deceive or jam enemy radar and will be used on <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> fighters, including the F-14, F-18, F-16 and AV-8B. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans production of 2,369 jammers. To date, $ 577 million has been spent on research and development of the system. <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, in a speech on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, said unclassified <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> documents quote testers as saying the system is `` marginally operationally effective. In order to become potentially effective, ASPJ effectiveness must be improved for all threats not meeting reference criteria.'' The senator complained that further testing on the system is not planned until 1991 when more than 300 systems will have been produced, or committed to production, at $ 2 million a copy. `` All arrows point to a multibillion dollar rip-off,'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said. In a letter to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Comptroller General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> asked that the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, review the testing, costs and possible alternatives to the jammer system. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> declined comment on the charges until it has seen <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>'s comments.

 <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> rides into <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on a donkey instead of an ass in a new English-language Bible that is careful not to upset <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> readers, the editor said Thursday. `` The old usage is a classic example of offense being caused in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for obvious reasons,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, coordinating editor of `` The Revised English Bible.'' In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the word ass does n't have as many meanings as it does in American use. `` References to ass have been adjusted to the inoffensive and unambiguous donkey,'' he said. The change is one of thousands in the 1,294-page revision of `` The New English Bible,'' which appeared in 1970 and which in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has largely replaced the Authorized Version or King <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bible </PERSON> of 1611 and its late 19th - century Revised Version <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said American viewpoints reached the translators through the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> offices of the <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> university presses, which are jointly printing the new Bible. `` They came largely from people who want to use the Bible literally, with only the meanings they attribute to the words, although a large number of Americans are used to the Authorized Version where ` ass' is used liberally,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. The publishers describe the new Bible as a linguistically updated version, whose style relates less to the vocabulary of a 19th-century clergyman and more to the needs of a 20th-century congregation. It substitutes `` you'' for `` thee'' and `` thou,'' `` did'' for `` didst'' and abandons the `` O'' in references to God such as `` O Lord.'' God is still referred to as `` he'' -LRB- but without a capital H -RRB- in faithfulness to the original writings, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said, but in other references to gender the version grapples with sexism for the first time in a British-produced Bible. `` English is not too well equipped to express gender,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> told a news conference. `` We carefully looked at all cases where male-oriented language was used _ ` men' or ` brethren' applied to people of both sexes _ and we used an inclusive gender term or adjusted the translation to sidestep the problem,'' he said. `` Brethren'' becomes `` friends'' in some places and `` a man'' sometimes is changed to `` a person.'' Elsewhere, `` corn'' has been changed to `` grain'' in many cases because it means wheat in some countries, maize in others and oats in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> <PERSON> McHardy </PERSON>, formerly Regius Professor of Hebrew at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the revision's director, was asked why the phrase, `` Vanity of vanities ... all is vanity'' from the first chapter of <LOCATION> Ecclesiastes </LOCATION> was changed to `` Futility, utter futility.'' `` We discussed it for a long time,'' he said. `` Vanity did not represent all that the original Hebrew ought to represent, but futility was the best we could do. We still have slight misgivings.'' <PERSON> Morna </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>, professor of New Testament studies at <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the only woman among the revisers, said: `` If God was referred to as ` she,' it would n't be the Bible, which one must remember is 19 centuries old. You must always stand at a slight distance from it.'' Scholars of all <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s mainstream churches cooperated for the first time in the revision, which took 15 years: Anglicans, <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON>, Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, Quakers, the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the Bible societies. Literary advisers included the poet <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> before his death in 1985 and novelist <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Coggan </PERSON>, former archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> and a scholar of ancient Hebrew who presided over meetings of the project committee, said they aimed to produce the `` first fully ecumenical Bible'' in `` straightforward language for reading in church that can be immediately understood.'' `` The Bible is one of the main tools of the Christian church but tools get blunt and the edges need resharpening. Knowledge increases as the years go by, language changes and style alters,'' he said. The new Bible, officially published Sept. 28 but already on sale, will be used immediately in Protestant churches but still needs the imprimatur _ license to publish _ of Catholic authorities before their congregations can use it, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. The revisers met in the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Chamber of 900-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abbey </ORGANIZATION> where the compilers of the first Revised Version met from 1871 to 1881. The work is being printed in a first run of 300,000 copies for the English-speaking world, including 200,000 for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Cass </PERSON>, chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> joined conservative party leaders from around the world Thursday at a meeting expected to focus on ways to help drives toward greater democracy in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> from a two-day trip to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, where he toured the Demilitarized Zone and denounced communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> as an `` astonishing dictatorial regime.'' He shares the spotlight at the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who asked the West to give stronger support to reforms initiated by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. British officials said Prime Minister <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had a half-hour meeting and discussed East-West relations and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, where Vietnamese troops began final withdrawal moves on Thursday. On Saturday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>. Next week, he holds talks with Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> and other Japanese leaders before traveling to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, founded in 1983, groups 26 right-of-center political parties, and holds leaders' meetings every two years. Representatives from 17 nations are attending this meeting, with <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s long-governing, conservative <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, acting as host. The three-day conference ends Saturday. Comments by <ORGANIZATION> IDU </ORGANIZATION> officials and advance texts of speeches indicated a major theme would be moves toward greater democracy in such East bloc countries as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration official said that in <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s keynote speech at a luncheon Friday, the vice president will urge his fellow conservatives to help democratic forces in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, as well as in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` In Central and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the crunch is really coming now,'' said the official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Peacock </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said in a speech prepared for delivery Friday that <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` is today at a watershed in its history -LRB- and -RRB- many states in the <LOCATION> Asia-Pacific </LOCATION> region are also searching for a new strategy.'' `` Who would have thought when we established the <ORGANIZATION> IDU </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 that we would, six years on, be witnessing such changes. We must renew ourselves in the battle of ideas and lead the agenda.'' <PERSON> Peacock </PERSON>, who is to become <ORGANIZATION> IDU </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said the organization should `` examine ways in which we can give practical assistance to those sympathetic parties that are developing in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>.'' The outgoing chairman, Norwegian former Prime Minister <PERSON> Kaare </PERSON> <PERSON> Willoch </PERSON>, told a news conference European conservatives have been traveling in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to make contacts with pro-democracy activists. `` I think this is very important, because through such contacts it is possible to help those groups fighting and working for freedom in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` This is a very complicated issue, because we all want to help, and we know that some sorts of help may be counterproductive. So thorough study of what's going on and what can be done are very useful.'' <PERSON> Willoch </PERSON> said it was premature to think of having Eastern European groups join the <ORGANIZATION> IDU </ORGANIZATION>, since forming non-communist political parties was still difficult. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> flies to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Friday to meet with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. She had lunch Thursday with Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>. In comments to reporters, she praised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as `` the most bold and courageous leader the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has had while it's been under communism. What Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is attempting to do ... is in the interests of liberty as a whole and in the interest of all other nations who believe in the cause of democracy as well. `` We should do, therefore, everything we can to support this great, historic movement.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> noted a trend in favor of Western political and economic views but cautioned against relaxing defenses. She predicted a period of `` very great uncertainty'' in East-West relations and cited unexpected developments in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as a strong example.

 Flight attendants had to throw seat cushions to passengers evacuated into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> after a <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> jetliner broke apart in an aborted takeoff because the plane was not required to carry life vests, a spokeswoman for the flight attendants union said Thursday. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeast </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> said the aircraft's cabin crew was unable to open all exits as the floor buckled and the plane broke apart. Seat cushions on commercial aircraft are designed to float, with enough buoyancy to support a person. Some flight attendants have been critical of rules that require inflatable life vests only on flights that spend appreciable time over major bodies of water, Ms. <PERSON> Yeast </PERSON> said. As it became apparent the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 carrying 61 people would not stop safely, the attendants began yelling `` brace'' commands to get passengers to grab their ankles and put their heads down to reduce injuries, she said. `` The floor of the plane buckled up and down like a roller coaster,'' Ms. <PERSON> Yeast </PERSON> said, based on information the union received from flight attendants and others. Some passengers were sent down an inflatable slide into the water. Others scrambled onto the aircraft's wing. Passengers in the water hung on to floating timbers and other debris untio rescued. Later, Ms. <PERSON> Yeast </PERSON> said, flight attendants and the plane's captain tried to use the slide as a raft _ as slides are designed to be used in a pinch _ to reach several passengers caught in the rear of the cabin as the plane sections filled with water. But the slide deflated, apparently punctured by debris, she said. The interior of the plane was dark and shifting in the current, Ms. <PERSON> Yeast </PERSON> said, as at least one passenger yelled for help from behind a place where the floor had buckled all the way up to the ceiling. That passenger and others were rescued, but two other passengers died in the accident. Ms. <PERSON> Yeast </PERSON> said the pilot and last flight attendants stayed in the aircraft trying to free passengers and left only after rescue workers arrived and ordered them to evacuate. `` When the flight attendants realized passengers were going into the water, they ripped of seat bottom cushions and began throwing them out the door,'' she said. People were in the water for as long as 30 minutes, she said, and some started singing as they awaited rescue. Ms. Yeast identified the flight attendants on the flight as <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jolynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Galmish </PERSON>, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrelson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>, all based in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>.

 A grand jury has indicted a federal drug agent, his wife and the owner of a construction company on charges of conspiracy, tax evasion and laundering large amounts of cash, officials said Thursday. The federal indictment named <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harker </PERSON>; his wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, who owns <ORGANIZATION> SKT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> was one of five recipients of the `` women of enterprise award'' sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> last year, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutmus </PERSON>, her lawyer. She's a business partner of <PERSON> Roxanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlin </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney and Democratic gubernatorial candidate. <PERSON> Kutmus </PERSON> said she is a widow with two young children whose husband died in a construction accident. He called her `` a spokeswoman for women in non-traditional positions.'' `` I was shocked and outraged to learn that I was being indicted,'' Ms. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> said at a brief news conference. The 11-count indictment alleges that between 1986 and 1988 <PERSON> Harker </PERSON> and his wife `` spent, invested and profited by cash transactions exceeding $ 1 million.'' <PERSON> Kutmus </PERSON> said he had advised Ms. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> not to comment on the facts of the case, but `` the charges themselves are ruinous to her and her business.'' <PERSON> Kutmus </PERSON> said he would enter an innocent plea at arraignments scheduled for Oct. 2. `` She feels she is wholly innocent and that the charges are very ridiculous,'' <PERSON> Kutmus </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Harker </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> were charged with using a business they established `` to launder substantial amounts of currency which <PERSON> Harker </PERSON> had acquired and to funnel the cash through what would appear to be legitimate business transactions and loans between the two partners.'' The indictment also says <PERSON> Harker </PERSON> loaned thousands of dollars in cash to other drug agents and spent more than $ 30,000 in cash to buy rare coins. There was no mention of drugs in the indictment, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> refused to elaborate on it. <PERSON> Harker </PERSON>, 42, is a supervisory agent for the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> who joined the agency in 1971, and previously was assigned to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, before coming to live in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>. He could face 40 years in prison and $ 2 million in fines if convicted on all the charges. The Harkers also could owe taxes and penalties. Mrs. <PERSON> Harker </PERSON>, 40, faces up to 20 years in prison and $ 1 million in fines if convicted. Ms. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, 38, faces up to 30 years in jail and fines of up to $ 1.5 million. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office said in a statement released Thursday that the indictment was handed up Wednesday. It resulted from an investigation that began in spring 1988 `` as a result of information received by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>,'' the statement said. In the indictment, <PERSON> Harker </PERSON> was charged with one count of conspiracy, three counts of tax evasion and four counts of using an interstate facility to promote illegal activity _ presumably the mailing of bundles of cash. His wife faces a conspiracy count and three tax evasion charges. Ms. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> faces three counts of arranging bank deposits to avoid a federal law that requires banks to report cash deposits larger than $ 10,000. The indictment details real estate transactions _ many in cash _ in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and other locations. Farmland, resort properties and homes were bought, the indictment said. The Harkers filed returns for 1986 claiming taxable income of $ 38,999, but it actually was more than $ 416,000, the indictment charged. For 1987, the couple claimed just over $ 34,000 but it really was nearly $ 680,000, the indictment charged. There was no mention of the source of the income in the indictment or accompanying statement.

<HEAD>Hersh Testifies at Own Libel Trial: I Tried to `Follow the Truth'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Journalist <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> testified Thursday he was trying to `` follow the truth'' when he wrote a book being challenged by a former <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> prime minister in a $ 100-million libel suit. <PERSON> Morarji </PERSON> <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>, prime minister from 1977-79, claims <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> defamed him by saying he was a paid <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> informant and a valuable `` asset'' to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government during the administrations of <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON>, called to the stand by lawyers for <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>, testified he had made several errors in the first printing of `` The Price of Power,'' a book he wrote in 1983 about former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>. The mistakes _ that <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> did not remain a cabinet member after he resigned in 1969 but was a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the spelling of <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>'s first name, and the year <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> returned to power _ were corrected in a second edition published a few months later. The mistakes are not at issue in the libel case. `` I made a mistake,'' <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> testified. `` The Indian ambassador called me up, told me I had a mistake there.'' When questioned by the plaintiff's attorney <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumgart </PERSON> about his accuracy in reporting and writing, <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> said he was attempting to be truthful. `` The notion is truth. I follow the truth, is what I'm trying to do,'' he said. <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> testified that six sources told him <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> worked as an informant for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, but acknowledged that he said in two 1983 interviews there were only two. He testified that one source among the six told him <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> was paid $ 20,000 to be an informant. `` Did it occur to you this source may not be accurate,'' questioned plaintiff's attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Meara </PERSON>. `` Yes, it would to anybody,'' <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> answered. But subsequent research `` butressed my view about certain important facts ... and increased my confidence which, in fact, was already high,'' <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> testified. Under questioning, <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> declined to reveal the name of another source who was a foreign service officer in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, for the Indian government. He said he submitted part of his manuscript prior to publication to the source for verification of its accuracy. Earlier, plaintiff's attorney <PERSON> Cyriac </PERSON> <PERSON> Kappil </PERSON> told the court <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> had been subpoenaed to testify, but his whereabouts were not known. `` We'll make every effort to bring him in,'' <PERSON> Kappil </PERSON> said. `` On a personal level, we prefer not to inconvenience Mr. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> because of his schedule.'' <PERSON> Kappil </PERSON> said he would give <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> the opportunity to come in voluntarily before asking the judge to enforce the subpoena. He also said he was considering using a videotaped deposition made by <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> if he was unsuccessful in procuring the former secretary of state. Under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> libel law, <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>'s attorneys must convince the six-member jury that <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> knowingly printed false, negligent or malicious material. <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> won the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting in 1970 for his articles exposing the My <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> massacre in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> when he was a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. He was also a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and for The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. He left the newspaper to pursue his own writing projects. He is working on a book on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>FBI Won't Appeal Court Order in Discrimination Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 14th graf, bgng: The suit xxx to CLARIFY that Perez was
FBI's second-highest ranking Hispanic agent.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it will not appeal a sweeping court order that sets in place mechanisms to end what a judge found was systematic discrimination against Hispanic agents. The decision against appealing the May 5 decision by a federal judge in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was made by Solicitor General <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, the bureau said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> made the announcement after receiving word of <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>'s decision. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said in a statement that after weighing `` the myriad legal, operational and institutional considerations,'' he recommended to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that no appeal be pursued in the case. Sessions said the decision not to pursue the appeal is in the best interests of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> employees. `` We must move beyond the frictions caused by this case to address the many vital challenges facing the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in the 1990s.'' The court order in the class-action suit by 311 of the bureau's approximately 400 Hispanic agents directed the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to adopt changes to end the `` unsystematic, excessively subjective'' method of promoting special agents In his order, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lucius </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, stripped the special agents in charge of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> field offices of the power to override decisions of career promotion boards. That system, the judge said, was `` anathema to nearly every reform advanced by the bureau and ordered by this court to improve the fairness and reviewability'' of promotion decisions. <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> also appointed an outside panel of three attorneys to conduct a case-by-case review to determine if as many as 200 Hispanic agents should be promoted to compensate for past discrimination. Under the terms of the order, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> can appeal the panel's findings to the judge <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON>'s order came as a result of more than two years of litigation in the class-action case, in which he had earlier found discrimination against Hispanics in promotions and working conditions. The judge had found that Hispanic agents were often relegated to undesirable assignments, such as monitoring the wiretaps of Spanish-speaking suspects in a criminal investigation. Since taking office in November 1987, Sessions conducted a review of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s personnel and recruitment practices. He reorganized the bureau's equal employment opportunity office, going outside the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to recruit a manager of that unit who now reports directly to him. In his order, <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> acknowledged that the changes ordered by Sessions `` demonstrate energetic and good-faith effort to correct the disparities found by this court.'' The suit was filed in early 1987 by <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> `` Mat'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 2 agent in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, the bureau's second-highest ranking Hispanic agent after he had suffered a series of demotions. The judge ordered <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> promoted to a job with responsibilities `` commensurate with his experience and training'' but denied any monetary damages or back pay to him or the other plaintiffs who eventually joined the lawsuit. As a result of the court order, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> was promoted to deputy assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s laboratory division in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s decision not to appeal was praised by Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on civil rights `` That's exactly the right decision, something we've been urging for many months,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. `` It's time for them to move on and get at the root causes of the problems associated with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>,'' the congressman said, referring to a racial harassment suit by a black <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> called the <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> case `` a thorn in their side day after day.'' <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> accuses the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> of tolerating racial harassment by white agents of him and his family while he was assigned to the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> field office. The lawsuit also accuses <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> supervisors of retaliating against him for complaining of racial harassment. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kairys </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s lawyer, contended in a telephone interview this week that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has filed a series of `` frivolous motions'' that he said were `` calculated to immobilize the court'' overseeing the case.

<HEAD>Swiss Former Justice Minister Charged With Passing Secrets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Justice Minister <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> was indicted on criminal charges of leaking official secrets to her lawyer-husband during an inquiry into drug money laundering, prosecutors announced Thursday. Special federal prosecutor <PERSON> Joseph-Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Piller </PERSON> said enough evidence was uncovered in a preliminary investigation to bring charges against Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> before <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s supreme court, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>, indicted Wednesday, resigned in January amid reports she gave her husband inside information. She is the only woman to have served as a Swiss government minister. Two former subordinates were also charged with passing confidential goverment information. <PERSON> Piller </PERSON> said in a statement an inquiry was dropped into whether Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>'s actions provided illegal benefits to her husband. Her troubles stem from a secret telephone call last October to her husband, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>, urging him to cut ties with a Zurich-based company, Lebanese-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Shakarchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>. The company had come under scrutiny in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s biggest-ever inquiry into the laundering of drug money. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> gave up his post as <PERSON> Shakarchi </PERSON> board vice president shortly before prosecutors linked the company to the scandal, which came to be called the `` <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Connection.'' The supreme court, responsible for handling cases involving government ministers, now must rule whether to accept as well-founded the charges against Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> indicated Thursday in a statement issued through her spokesman that she will contest the charges. She has denied criminal wrongdoing while acknowledging she made a `` mistake.'' She could face a prison term or fine if tried and convicted. No charges have been filed against <PERSON> Shakarchi </PERSON>, which has denied involvement.

The furious crowd kicked and punched <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> before he escaped to a dressing room, sheltered by his trainer and manager <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tibbs </PERSON>. `` The first thing I saw was my mum in the ring, and then everything went wild,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Wolverhampton </LOCATION>, central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` She has been watching my fights for years and nothing like this has happened before.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s top policeman, Interior Minister <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON>, said 292 people were killed, 5,250 were wounded and 360,000 had to flee their homes in ethnic violence since January 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> reported on the magnitude of the problem on Wednesday, final day of a two-day meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> devoted to trying to resolve the country's ethnic turmoil. He said thousands of homes were robbed or burned down in the past 20 months. It has been months since Soviet officials issued any nationwide statistics on ethnic violence. Unofficial counts had put the number of dead at slightly more than 200 and the number of refugees at about 200,000. <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> did not break down the statistics by ethnic groups. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> passed a policy statement calling for the 15 Soviet republics to take on more economic and political autonomy, including ownership of all natural resources, but drew a line at calls for independence. At the end of the long-delayed session, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> accepted the retirement of Ukrainian party chief <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nikonov </PERSON> from the ruling Politburo. In a major power play, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also succeeded in promoting his new <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON>, and economic planning chief <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON>. Ethnic activists interviewed by telephone on Thursday cheered the three retirements, but said the development may not change official attitudes toward their demands for sovereignty. `` Everybody thinks it was a good riddance,'' journalist <PERSON> Tarmu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tammerk </PERSON> of the newspaper <PERSON> Kodumaa </PERSON> said of the reaction in the small Baltic republic of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON>, 71, the last holdover from the 1964-82 era of President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, was regarded as one of the Politburo's most conservative members He kept a tight rein on the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> for 17 years. He did not immediately resign as Ukrainian party chief, but that is likely when a Central Committee meeting can be held in his republic. <LOCATION> Ukrainian </LOCATION> activists said they did not know who might replace him, and doubted whether his successor would pursue more moderate policies. `` All the members of the Ukrainian Politburo are more or less like <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON>, even the younger ones'' said <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorin </PERSON>, a leader of the Ukrainian <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> group, formed to monitor human rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s second-largest republic. <PERSON> Gorin </PERSON> said in a telephone call from <LOCATION> Lvov </LOCATION> he was disappointed in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s speech setting out his ethnic policy. The speech smacked of `` old stereotypes'' that regard the country as being under a unified government rather than a federation of equal governments, he said. `` He started for the first time to threaten those political figures and organizations who are raising the issue of independence,'' <PERSON> Gorin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would not tolerate anarchy in the Soviet republics, or separatist `` demagogues.'' <PERSON> Tonis </PERSON> <PERSON> Avikson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said his political movement found little new and nothing to worry about in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s speech. For Estonians, the retirement of conservative Politburo members was more important, he said. He said the activists particularly were pleased by <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON>'s retirement Some people accused <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> of knowing beforehand of an attack by soldiers on a nationalist protest in the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> republic. Twenty protesters were killed. <PERSON> Avikson </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON>, who was promoted in the shake-up, does not share the Baltic republics' enthusiasm for economic self-management. He takes a particularly hard line on the idea of transferring control of state-run enterprises from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to the republics, <PERSON> Avikson </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON> is not a big radical,'' he said. `` We have our differences with him, but I think it's possible to talk to him.''

<HEAD>Communist Leader Released from Jail, Accuses Government of Kidnap</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The second-in-command of the <ORGANIZATION> Haitian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was released Thursday after six days in jail and accused the military government of trying to kidnap him. `` I escaped by the skin of my teeth. ... The three police who broke into my courtyard wanted to kidnap me. They roughed up the guard, but he did n't have a key, so they could n't get into my house without making noise,'' <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourjolly </PERSON> said after he and his guard were released from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bourjolly </PERSON> was arrested last Friday, several hours after his security guard <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Herard </PERSON> had been taken into custody for illegal possession of an Uzi submachine gun. `` The kidnapping failed, so they arrested me instead. If the kidnapping had succeeded, I might have been killed,'' he said. <PERSON> Bourjolly </PERSON> admitted his guard did not have a permit for the weapon, but said he had been `` targeted by the government because of my opposition to its economic policy.'' On Aug. 29, the government of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> decreed a series of tax measures that drew protests from politicians and labor leaders. They claimed tariffs and tax hikes for small shopkeepers, allegedly imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, would provoke social upheaval. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, one of the poorest countries in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, recently negotiated a $ 26.5 million standby loan with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. It owes the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> $ 41 million. On Monday, bus horns honked and people beat on pots and pans in a 15-minute symbolic protest called by 18 organizations. The six political parties _ including the <ORGANIZATION> Haitian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the centrist parties of <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dejoie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronceray </PERSON> _ four labor unions and eight other groups threatened to call for a general strike if the government did not rescind the measures. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Haitian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> said the measures `` might lead to a social explosion.'' In a news conference last month, <PERSON> Bourjolly </PERSON> was the first to denounce government negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bourjolly </PERSON>, 48, said he was well-treated during his week in jail, although he claimed <PERSON> Herard </PERSON> was beaten. <PERSON> Bourjolly </PERSON> was arrested twice during the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> regime, and was jailed in the dreaded Fort Dimanche prison. He was released and expelled from <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> in 1977, in a general amnesty of political prisoners, after 13 months in jail.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland forces carrying shotguns patrolled <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> on Thursday to stop looting that has frightened islanders and tourists in the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official said the American forces found `` chaos and near anarchy'' upon arrival in this popular <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resort, but the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> later said the situation was improving. The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION>, monitored on nearby <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION>, said two looters had been shot in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, the largest and most populous island of the chain. However, there was no word of their condition or independent confirmation. The latest forces arriving from the mainland joined 100 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general ordered to the island. On Thursday, dozens of marshals with shotguns were posted in front of the downtown federal building, while others patrolled the streets on foot. One woman checking her destroyed yacht screamed insults at marshals when they aimed weapons at her, apparently mistaking her for a looter. `` Go after the bloody criminals, not the honest citizens!'' she shouted. Territorial Sen. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> <PERSON> Redfield </PERSON> said that in many cases, supermarkets gave people permission to take the food because it was spoiling. He said only a few looters were hardcore criminals. People were reported carrying guns after widespread looting convulsed the island, which still lacks water, power and telephone service in the wake of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s wrath. There were new reports Thursday that looting was rampant too on neighboring <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION>, the second most populous of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and also a popular tourist site for Americans. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> damaged virtually every building on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, an island of 53,000 about 70 miles east of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Authorities reported one drowning, and hundreds were reported injured and thousands homeless. Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Layton </PERSON> <PERSON> Timmons </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, who was at the airport watching mainland forces disembark, said there were only 900 guardsmen in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. He acknowledged that the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> had videotaped some guardsmen who had taken part in looting. `` When two people start looting, the whole Guard gets the wrap,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` Do n't condemn the organization. I do n't loot.'' By late Thursday, it appeared most unprotected stores had been sacked and there appeared to be little left to loot. The Coast Guard on Wednesday began evacuating to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> all people who feared for their safety. A C-146 transport plane with 70 aboard, mostly tourists, arrived late Wednesday at old <ORGANIZATION> Ramey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Agua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dilla </LOCATION>, about 75 miles west of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials expected to bring up to 200 more people from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> on Thursday. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Curren </PERSON>, a writer from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said after stepping off the plane that mobs had `` established the law of the revolver'' by shooting and breaking into stores. On <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Longsworth </PERSON>, spokesman for the 18th <ORGANIZATION> Airborne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said his unit's mission is to assist local civilian authorities in restoring order and protecting public and private property. `` We will stay until the mission is accomplished,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, weary residents and tourists who arrived Thursday from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> said they armed themselves with makeshift weapons and watched in horror as looters rampaged through the island. <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> told of forming a `` dynamic team'' with several dozen others who took refuge in a hotel outside of <LOCATION> Christiansted </LOCATION>. He said they used machetes to sharpen flag poles into spears and blocked roads to the hotels with trees and debris because of fears of potential violence. `` Once it became dark, you really got spooked,'' he said, describing hearing weapons fire. But he and others said they were not attacked by looters. The first contingent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel landed at 7:40 a.m. EDT on the island and moved quickly to establish a mobile control tower and prepare the airfield for the arrival of 1,105 military police, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundquist </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. By late afternoon Thursday, five aircraft carrying a total of 230 people and 105 tons of cargo had arrived on St. Croix. Three more aircraft were en route with 120 people and 40 additional tons of cargo, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> Longsworth </PERSON> said the rest of the soldiers were to arrive later Thursday and Friday. He said most of the units consist of military police. `` Martial law has not been declared. We are just here to assist local authorities. We are authorized to make arrests only in the total absence of local authorities,'' <PERSON> Longsworth </PERSON> said. By late Thursday, the helmeted, heavily armed soldiers, equipped with flak jackets and backpacks, were still at the airport with only the federal marshals deployed downtown. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and federal marshals will `` help local authorities get back on their feet.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s first priority was to stop the looting. `` The looting is still going on,'' <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> said. `` I think that by the end of the day, things will begin to return to normal.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` The troops are having an obvious impact in controlling the looting and other lawlessness associated with the destruction. It is impossible to say at this point how long they will have to be there.'' He said, `` The local officials of course are still in charge of law enforcement there.'' Another military spokesman, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, said the troops had encountered problems landing on St. Croix because the small airfield was crowded and there were no night lights. Planes overturned by the storm littered the airport. Two guided missile carriers, the <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Groves </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON>, have been moved into the area as a precaution, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. The troops, the first active duty military personnel sent onto the nation's streets in 20 years, were ordered by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Wednesday night. Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, said earlier Thursday the troops had been issued rifles and told to shoot if necessary to defend themselves. All told, the troops would include 635 military police from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and 470 military police from companies in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leonard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. Generally, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is summoned to restore order in civil disturbances. But presidents are allowed to use federal troops by declaring an emergency. The last time federal troops were used to suppress riots was in 1968 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and other cities after the assassination of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, administration officials said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> authorized the use of troops in 1987 to handle prison riots in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, but they were never deployed.

 <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> on Thursday bid farewell from his deathbed to his successor, President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s doctor said. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Saca </PERSON>, the former president's personal physician, said <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> arrived early Thursday to see <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, who is dying of liver cancer. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s cancer was diagnosed in June 1988. His condition has deteriorated rapidly the past two days, and his doctor says the end is near. `` It seemed like the visit raised his spirits a bit,'' said <PERSON> Saca </PERSON>. Even so, he said the 63-year-old <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> `` is in a terminal state.'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> arrived before journalists had taken up watch at <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s home in the fashionable <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benito </LOCATION> neighborhood, so what the two men said to each other was not available. <PERSON> Saca </PERSON> said the cancer now `` has invaded the lungs.'' The doctor said <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> was asking for friends and colleagues to be sent to his room for brief farewells. `` He is completely aware that he is dying,'' said <PERSON> Saca </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s youngest child, <PERSON> Lorena </PERSON>, said her father was in a coma for a time Thursday, but woke up, got out of bed, sat down in a wheelchair and in `` a moment of lucidity'' asked that a favorite grandson be brought to see him. Moments earlier, <PERSON> Raquel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON>, wife of Guatemalan President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON>, told reporters <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> sat up and spoke with her _ `` He was lucid. Even joking.'' <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Ines </PERSON>, told reporters earlier Thursday, `` His condition is very serious. He could die today or tomorrow.'' The former president's wife, <PERSON> Ines </PERSON>, all six of his children and most of their spouses were at the house. Monsignor <PERSON> Fredy </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON>, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s confessor, said <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> received last rites early Thursday. He said <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has taken communion every day since his cancer was diagnosed last year. <ORGANIZATION> Saca </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has given up the battle and was refusing medication that could prolong his life. `` We're trying to make his death painless,'' <PERSON> Saca </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s condition has been critical since Tuesday, when his health badly deteriorated while he was attending a meeting of regional <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> was president for five years and was <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s staunchest ally in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> He handed over power to <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, on June 1. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> underwent treatment last year at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Two-thirds of his cancerous stomach was removed and chemotherapy was used to slow the disease's advance in his kidneys. He had been receiving chemotherapy periodically until last month, when he was judged too weak to endure more.

 Most whites would not mind having a black dinner guest, boss, doctor or neighbor, but well over half say they do n't want their sisters dating one, according to poll results released Thursday. The poll conducted for <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> said that 30 percent of whites believe members of their race are prejudiced against blacks. An earlier poll of blacks by the newspaper found that 26 percent of blacks believe whites are prejudiced. The poll of whites, conducted Sept. 13-14, found that 75 percent said they have had black guests in their home, 86 percent would have no objection to having a black next-door neighbor, 86 percent would not mind having a black doctor, and 89 percent had no problem with the idea of a black boss. But 60 percent said they would not approve of their sisters dating black men, and 69 percent objected to the idea giving jobs to blacks to make up for past discrimination if it meant that equally qualified white people were to be passed over. The poll, which contacted 806 white adults nationwide selected at random, has a sampling error of plus of minus 3.5 percent.

 Justice Minister <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>, who traveled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to seek protection for judges under death threats from Colombian drug lords, resigned Thursday after two months on the job, a radio chain reported. She would be the sixth justice minister in three years to resign. Ms. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>, 32, has been threatened with death since she signed an extradition order that brought <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on Sept. 6 to face <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges that he was a drug money launderer for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. The report by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> could not be confirmed late Thursday at either the presidential palace or the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Her resignation has been rumored almost since she took the post July 16. She has been constantly surrounded by bodyguards and secret police scout the routes to and from the ministry before she is driven to her office. She is said to take a different route every day. After the radio report, Ms. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>, a lawyer and mother of a 3-year-old son, met Thursday night with President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> at the palace. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>, quoting unidentified sources, said she handed a letter of resignation to the president, who offered her the ambassadorial post in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. She reportedly declined. She traveled to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in August amid reports she had resigned. But she repeatedly denied those reports, one of which was by <PERSON> Caracol </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, she met with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials and won a pledge of $ 19 million to provide security for the hundreds of Colombian judges under death threats from drug traffickers. At least 41 judges and 220 court officials have been killed by traffickers the past 10 years. Reports say she left her son in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because he was also threatened by death, as was her husband. Wearing a black and white checkered suit, her blonde hair pulled back in braids and her face framed by heart-shaped amethyst earrings, the young minister has become well-known in the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> news media. When she teamed up with <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, 69, she vowed to wage a tough fight against the cocaine cartels, winning admiration for her courage worldwide. `` What Americans are seeing is this brave old man, this young woman and her child fighting these criminals,'' drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s government is presently in crisis following allegations that senior government officials are being paid by drug cartels. Early Thursday, 10 bombs ripped through the offices of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s main political parties after senators urged the government to publish names of officials suspected of taking bribes from drug barons Newspapers Thursday identified 25 politicians denied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visas, following days of rumors the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a blacklist of Colombian officials on the payroll of drug traffickers. Nine bombs in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> went off shortly after 3 a.m. in nine offices of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and opposition <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Another explosion damaged a savings and loan bank. Two people were injured in the blasts. There have been reports the government has a list of politicians, journalists, army and police officials allegedly spying for drug cartels. During debate this week, senators asked the government to make the alleged list public, but President <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> has denied such a list exists. A list was published in newspapers Thursday naming 25 legislators and other politicians recently refused entry to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Londono </PERSON> <PERSON> Paredes </PERSON> said he will ask <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for its blacklist. `` We want to establish the context in which the information was made public,'' he told reporters. Three senators claimed Thursday they were denied visas for political reasons, rather than links to drug traffickers. <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Santofimio </PERSON> <PERSON> Botero </PERSON> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of retaliating for his criticism of its intervention in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He claimed one reason he was denied a visa is that he met <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel leader <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, the most wanted man in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, eight years ago at a political rally while both were congressmen. But he said he `` barely knew him.'' Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Slebi </PERSON>, also of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` This is part of the war the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is waging in our country ... for us to submit to them on extraditions. But I will never approve of the extradition of Colombians to battle narco-traffickers.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> refused to comment on the list, citing the Privacy Act. Embassy spokesman <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Urutia </PERSON> said he did not know if those denied visas are suspected of links to drug merchants. Barco declared war on the cocaine cartels after the Aug. 18 assassination of leading presidential candidate Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, a staunch enemy of drug dealers. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> then decreed emergency measures empowering him to bypass <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to extradite Colombians to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Only <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, accused of being the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel's financier, has been extradited Top drug barons remain at large, including <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>.

 The groom survived a plane crash, but the wedding site was in the path of Hurricane Hugo, which had just rendered the intended honeymoon resort a disaster area. `` I've had everything possible go wrong with this wedding so far,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberry </PERSON>, shortly after the crash of <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> Flight 5050. The plane skidded off a <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> runway into the water late Wednesday. Two people died, and 59 survived. The flight was headed for <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Newberry </PERSON> was going to <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, on the coast 1 -LCB- hours north of <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. He's to be married there, to <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bland </PERSON>, on Saturday. Unfortunately, Hurricane Hugo was expected to arrive about midnight Thursday. The couple, both 27, then plan to take a honeymoon. `` You'd laugh if I told you -LRB- where -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Newberry </PERSON>. `` Virgin Islands.'' The <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> resort has been declared a disaster area. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> passed through a string of islands Sunday and Monday, leveling buildings, killing 26 people and leaving 50,000 homeless. Only once during the crash ordeal did <PERSON> Newberry </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> banker, question if he'd make it. `` It's not a pleasant feeling,'' he said. `` There were problems maneuvering the -LRB- police -RRB- boat and we got caught sort of sideways near the boat. ... I was really mortified.'' `` We just grabbed onto a big piece of floating wood and held on for dear life,'' he said. `` I was just hoping and thinking that if we just held onto the wood we'd be alright, surely some boat would come get us. We were all screaming bloody murder at whoever was up on the runway.'' Those aboard knew what was coming about 30 seconds before the crash, <PERSON> Newberry </PERSON> said. `` Everybody was kind of grim and just got down,'' he said. `` There was no indication given that there was going to be a crash. Everybody just knew it.'' Barely three hours later, <PERSON> Newberry </PERSON> seemed quite calm as he spoke to reporters. He'd already called his fiancee twice. `` East River water does n't taste real good,'' he recounted. `` My shoes are at the bottom right now, along with all my clothing.'' <PERSON> Newberry </PERSON> got off the plane via an emergency slide. Next he had to figure out how to get to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. At last report, he was planning to drive.

 Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Thursday the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Equatorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> are so far behind in their dues they risk losing their vote in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Charter says any nation two years behind loses the right to vote in the Assembly. The Assembly may let the country vote if it is satisfied that failure to pay is due to circumstances beyond the country's control. The <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which is assessed about $ 224,000 annually, must come up with $ 223,600 to keep its voting rights, said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief's letter. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, assessed more than $ 74,000 annually, must pay $ 12,057 and <LOCATION> Equatorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, assessed the same, must pay $ 46,300 to keep their votes. When a small, impoverished nation has been unable to pay in the past, its former colonial power or a major ally quietly paid the dues. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is also in arrears, but has refused to pay since the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> suspended its voting rights in 1974 as punishment for its racial segregation policy. If its voting privileges were restored, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would have to pay more than $ 35 million to regain its vote. Dues are based on a formula that largely relies on a nation's gross national product The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still owes more than anyone. As of Aug. 31, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was $ 278.8 million in arrears for past years and owes more than $ 216 million for this year's dues, bringing the total close to $ 500 million. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is assessed for one-fourth of the regular <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget, about $ 216 million a year. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration began withholding a large portion of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dues starting in 1985 to spur reforms and budget cuts at the world body. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> announced a year ago he was satisfied with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> progress along these lines and authorized full payment of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dues and payment of all back dues on a six-year plan.

<HEAD>TV Movie Features Tough Anti-Drug Unit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Nasty Boys, a tough anti-drug police unit with a penchant for breaking down doors and manhandling drug dealers, touts the motto `` We Make House Calls.'' That's the plan tonight when the TV version of the drug busters visits homes across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, 9-11 p.m. EDT -RRB-. Television crews spent several weeks here last spring putting together a two-hour movie they hoped might evolve into a new series this fall. The show failed to make <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s series schedule, but producer <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> hopes `` The Nasty Boys'' may still achieve that status, if the public reacts well to the movie. The show, with <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION>'s usual poetic license, is based on the activities of a crack anti-drug unit formed by the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last year to fight the city's growing drug problem. The Nasty Boys, an elite band of undercover cops, wage a high profile battle against the city's drug dealers _ breaking into crack houses while wearing black Ninja-type outfits and masks to hide their identity. City officials say the no-nonsense approach, using tactics befitting the group's name, is paying off by making a dent in the drug problem. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, whose credits include co-producer of `` Miami Vice'' and executive consultant on `` Hill Street Blues,'' sees `` Nasty Boys'' as the first of the'90s - genre cop `` We want to tell the story that there is literally a war going on against drugs,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. `` This is unapologetically pro-police. This is pro-attitude that this drug problem has got to stop.'' Shooting locales ranged from a cemetery to crack houses to $ 4 million mansions. There were helicopter shots along the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and shooting in and around the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel and Casino. The idea was brought to <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> after a segment on the anti-drug unit was featured on `` The Reporters'' TV show. The Nasty Boys had allowed a `` Reporters'' camera crew to follow them around on some drug raids. `` They showed me this picture of the Nasty Boys, with their masks, Ninja outfits and exotic weapons, posed against a brick wall covered with graffiti,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> recalled. `` I told them, ` This is a hit show.''' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said he took the idea to <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> entertainment, in mid-January and received the green light. Network executives did not see the finished version before setting the fall schedule, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. `` There'll be some touching stuff, some stuff with families,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. `` It will show how five guys with diverse backgrounds are molded into this very special team. `` It is exploitative in a most positive way. These cops are heros. We've stayed away from gory violence. There are no gratuitous killings. `` These guys are waging a war, but they're not vigilantes. They're good cops. They use weapons most police would n't use, but they're facing guys who do the same. They're not up against guys who play by the rules.'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> admits to use of poetic license in developing a `` Nasty Boys'' story line. In the movie, six members of a police tactical team are killed by drug dealers and the city's mayor orders formation of a group to handle the drug problem by using some of the enemy's tactics. In fact, no such incident spawned the group. There is no name star in the show. The five principals play cops who are used to being free agents and must now learn to work as a group. A brother of one of the team members is `` dirty,'' obligated to the mob because of _ what else? _ gambling debts. His involvement puts members of the team in jeopardy, and <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> is n't tipping his hand on the outcome. The actual Nasty Boys team members are used in some of the scenes, including a mock raid that was staged for the cameras.

 On Saturday night, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a Tony award-winner, will portray Rev. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON>, an early civil rights activist in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. A docudrama? Sort of. But it's from <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, not the network's entertainment division. The dramatization appears on `` Saturday Night With <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>,'' a new series whose executive producer, <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lack </PERSON>, ran the `` West 57th'' series that <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>'s series succeeds. He calls the new effort a `` contemporary ` You Are There.''' That's the CBS News series of the 1950s that, with <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> anchoring, re-created such historical events as <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Gettysburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Address </ORGANIZATION>. But there's a difference. <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> says the technique her show uses is that of the <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON> film, `` Reds,'' which in telling the story of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, an American radical, interspersed interviews of people who knew him. The first half of Saturday's show will use that technique, she says. CBS would n't provide a tape of the show for advanced screening, but the balance is apparently devoted to interviews concerning the modern relevance of <PERSON> Johns </PERSON>' urging his middle-class black congregation to fight their complacency and stand up for their rights. <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> died 24 years ago. Lack's new venture comes at a time old network strictures against re-creations in news programs are easing, at least in <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Yesterday, Today & amp; Tomorrow. But Saturday's show is not Lack's first re-creation for a news program. He did it in 1983 with `` The Plane That Fell From the Sky,'' a CBS Reports special about a jetliner that plummeted 33,000 feet before its pilots regained control. In that re-enactment, he used the plane's real crew and 39 passengers from the near-fatal flight. But his use of an actor, however distinguished, in a news series has raised eyebrows among news traditionalists. Some, like <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, oppose re-creations in general, saying that no matter how responsibly and honestly done, they cause questions in the minds of viewers about what is real and what is n't. Lack says there wo n't always be re-creations on <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>'s show `` but we're certainly not shy about them and we'll do them often.'' Asked how he would respond to critics of re-creations in a news program, he responded: `` This program speaks for itself. It needs no defense or explanation.'' For that matter, he says, he finds debate over re-recreations `` academic, pointless, foolish. I think it's just dumb.'' <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> says she does n't feel uncomfortable about dramatizations, at least the kind that will be in her show. `` Not one bit,'' she says. `` You'll see very clearly how it works. ... I think it works beautifully.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 In addition to <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>'s series, Lack is working on an outside project commissioned by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, a proposed dramatization about <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> and her role in the much-publicized beating death of 6-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> two years ago. Lack's wearing of two hats, as a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> producer and as an independent producer of a show for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, is unusual but not unprecented. In 1977, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> made a formal effort to combine a news producer's experience and background in making entertainment-division docudramas The network set up what proved to be a short-lived experiment, headed by the respected news and documentary producer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> `` Shad'' <PERSON> Northshield </PERSON>. The unit had no involvement with NBC News. Neither did <PERSON> Northshield </PERSON> while he headed the unit. He was on loan from the news division. No projects were ever made, and <PERSON> Northshield </PERSON> moved on to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. Lack says his <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> colleagues `` have no problem with my work outside the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> division.'' He says he believes `` everyone here knows where my heart is, in news. But I'm allowed to dabble in other areas from time to time without it threatening the institution.'' The story of <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> would seem ripe for a dramatization. Her lover, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, was sent to prison last March for killing his illegally adopted daughter, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, who had observed the child's abuse for years but said she had also been beaten by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, testified against him and charges against her were dropped. Her life with <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, and her failure to prevent <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death, brought her both public sympathy and condemnation No script has been written for the <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> program yet and the proposal is still in discussion stages, Lack said. He declined to say if <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> is being paid for her story. `` I have nothing to say about that,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 One of the most intimidating threats to peace of mind is a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> searching for new sources of revenue, because somewhere, somehow, someone will have to pay. The threat is all the more real because in this, if not in other matters, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' mind seems to be made up _ never on details, perhaps, but on the general idea that government forever will need more money. In ways most people do not understand, proposals for tax cuts become tax increases, and whenever a tax decrease escapes into law it is thereafter stripped of all its benefits, leaving little more money in taxpayers' pockets. Throughout the 1980s, tax cuts have been eroded by subsequent increases, some of them imposed with little publicity. Why? Because they appeared almost insignificant at the time. But as they say, little increases do add up. Consider the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. It promised corporate tax reductions averaging $ 51 billion in the years 1987-89. But by 1986, says the <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, this `` reduction'' became a $ 20 billion-a-year increase. Somehow, such things happen when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> goes rummaging through the tax code, and it may happen again. As your neighbors might tell you, it is one of the most fearsome things that can happen to good Americans. The latest tax go-round probably was initiated by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who proposed that capital gains taxes, the kind imposed on investment earnings, be cut substantially, from as high as 33 percent to as low as 15 percent. To do so, he said, would raise revenue, for a couple of years at least, because lower taxes would encourage people who owned stocks to redeem them for cash, and thereby declaring their capital gains and paying their taxes. Besides, he suggested, it was only fair. Such investments involve risk, he observed. The benefits from such investments are delayed rather than immediate. And much of the tax is imposed on inflated rather than real returns. Some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rebelled, saying such a cut would be a gift to the rich, and could not be permitted. The rich should be taxed more, they said, and so they proposed a tax increase, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is now considering. In such manner has a tax cut generated the threat of a tax increase. Seldom, however, is any tax matter as open, clear and understandable as that. In the past, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has actually passed taxes it never meant to pass, and has ommitted items it thought it had included. Always there are surprises. In the recent tax increase proposal, for instance, the emphasis is on making life more expensive for the rich, even though the definition of `` rich'' is highly suspect. -LRB- In tax logic, for instance, a person who never made $ 20,000 a year but who, through lifelong discipline, may be rich for the one year in which the funds are redeemed, is defined as rich. And so taxed. -RRB- Somehow, in this latest proposal, the matter of private pension funds was introduced. They have lots of money, $ 2 trillion or more, so it was n't askew of tax reasoning to go after them. And so the suggestion is being made: Why not tax these tax-exempt entities every time they are involved in a short-term securities trade? Typically, the rationale being offered is not that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants more money, but that those pension funds should be investing for the long term. Too much of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, it is said, is thinking short-term. This will help correct it. It could do more than that. It could become the foot in the door, or if you prefer, the nose of the camel in the tent. That is, more could follow, drawn irresistibly by the vast possibilities of such vast sums of money.

The `` Frank-Murphy Project'' was definitely out, it sounded too much like an album-rock band. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> considered Fiberglass and This Record Itches before thinking of The System and phoning <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. `` It has so many meanings. It's political, the body, a manner of the way things work together. We can go on. I was thinking, ` <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> is from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and I'm from <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>.' I used to say, ` We are <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.' We have the whole spectrum on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. Names matter, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> insist. When they start writing a song, the title often comes first; music and lyrics are filled in. That's why ballads are rare for The System. Working titles such as `` Groove'' and `` You're in My System'' just do n't seem right for slow songs. Neither do `` Midnight Special'' nor `` Wicked,'' tracks off their new album `` Rhythm & amp; Romance.'' `` A lot of times we'll fit things together,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. `` The Beatles used to do exactly the same thing: ` Let's just take this bridge and inject it into this song.''' Their childhoods had little in common, except a love for music. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> grew up in the <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, literally on the wrong side of the tracks. `` I lived at the edge of town,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said, `` and <ORGANIZATION> WLIB </ORGANIZATION> was the only R & amp; B station in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area and only during daylight hours. Right when we crossed into our town, I'd be listening to my mother's car radio and it would fade out and we'd get a Top 40 station from <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. While <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> had to fumble with the radio dial to hear the music he loved, rhythm and blues was practically in <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s backyard. The local barbershop was owned by the father of future Funkadelic guitarist <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> and several other aspiring funk stars _ <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Drayton </PERSON> _ were in the neighborhood. `` I was in bands when I was 10 or 11,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> recalled. `` ` Little Mic and the Soulshakers.' We played a lot of social clubs and dances at the time. My parents and their friends went to these clubs and because we were the only young kids who had a band, we got to play every weekend. `` People would say, ` They're so cute.' We were getting paid 50 bucks a night. We'd be the midnight floor show. We'd play all the new songs and the audences loved it. We were like the local <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 5.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, meanwhile, was being groomed for a more highbrow career, studying classical piano at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservatory </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> of Music. Rock' n' roll won out, but he did not forget his early training. `` It affects the way I think of music,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. `` I'll refer to a song as a concerto, a vocal concerto.'' `` That's what happened with ` Do n't Disturb This Groove,''' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> added. `` That's the first movement. ` Soul to Soul' on this album is the second movement.'' The Sytem has other influences, including the Rolling Stones, Sly and the Family Stone, Parliament-Funkadelic and Led Zeppelin. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s musical tastes ranged so wide, they at first had no idea into which radio format or formats their songs would fit. `` We'd never been on a chart,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. `` I looked at the label and saw our names as producers and thought, ` So that's what producuers do.' We did n't have any plan in mind. We just did it were getting paid more money than we had ever gotten before.''

 The federal agency that polices the commodity markets has been called a snoozing watchdog since scores of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> traders were indicted for fraud this summer, but its top cop says the charges show the system works. `` You would n't have had the results you had without our involvement in this,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Klejna </PERSON>, enforcement chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Klejna </PERSON> reluctantly agreed to an interview to talk aobut the work of the commission, which is under congressional review for reauthorization of its authority. It faces extraordinary scrutiny partly because of a major fraud scandal in the freewheeling commodity pits of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. More than 40 traders and brokers at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> were indicted in August, the result of a 2 -LCB- - year undercover investigation in which <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents posing as traders taped conversations To congressional critics, the scope of the indictments suggested that the defendants had used the commodity pits as their personal profiteering club and that the commodity commission had been lax in detecting and stopping it. `` Yes, a lot of people were indicted,'' <PERSON> Klejna </PERSON> said. `` I guess people can say that's a large number and there may be more _ potentially _ we do n't know that yet, or at least we're not going to comment on it.'' But <PERSON> Klejna </PERSON> -LRB- pronounced CLAY-neh -RRB- said the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> indictments `` should not be seen as a sign of weakness but rather as a sign of strength.'' The commodity commission is an independent agency that oversees 13 futures markets in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and other cities, much like its sister agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the stock and bond markets. While it considers the exchanges and their rules as the first line of defense against fraud, the commodity commission is responsible for keeping the futures markets fair. <PERSON> Klejna </PERSON>, a 42-year-old lawyer with prematurely gray hair, knows about that strength first hand. He has been with the commission almost from its creation by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1974. He was an officer with the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s Judge Advocate General Corps when he read about a new federal agency seeking lawyers. A 1971 law school graduate from <ORGANIZATION> Fordham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in his native <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Klejna </PERSON> joined the commission as a staff attorney in August 1976 and rose to special counsel in 1978, deputy director of enforcement in 1981 and director since April 1983. This past week, he was one of several senior federal agency executives who received the presidential award for distinguished service. `` Fiscal year 1989 was one of the most challenging and active years in the history of the commission,'' the agency's 1991 budget proposal for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> says. But to <PERSON> Klejna </PERSON>, `` they're always busy years.'' To get to his sixth floor office in downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, visitors must thread through a maze of receptionist desks and crowded computer work stations that suggest the commission is outgrowing its space. <PERSON> Klejna </PERSON>'s corner office reveals little of the man who oversees the commodity police force. There is a large desk and table, some chairs and an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag in one corner. Two works of art decorate a wall, both of them framed posters _ one from the American Ballet Theater. Among the many undisclosed details of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> probe is whether the commission uncovered the wrongdoing first and alerted the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> or vice versa. The commission has no criminal authority and can seek only civil sanctions for trading violations, tapping its enforcement staff of 140, half of them lawyers. `` I do think you could say they are attempting an enormous job with inadequate resources and that there is no question of the integrity and concientiousness of that division,'' said <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a prominent <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lawyer and expert on securities and commodities regulation. `` Having said that, however, I think there are substantial questions as to whether they have their priorities properly aligned,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. A number of market problems, he said, `` are best left to rule-making procedures and interpretative guidance rather than enforcement or disciplinary actions.'' That sentiment seems to be shared by several commodities lawyers. Just a few weeks before the indictments were announced, <PERSON> Klejna </PERSON> was a panelist at an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> function in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` And not one, but two defense lawyers that were on that panel talked about how trading abuses had gone on all the time and what's the big deal,'' <PERSON> Klejna </PERSON> said He said the lawyers also questioned the appropriateness of prosecuting traders for what had been seen in the past as essentially `` parking ticket'' violations. But to <PERSON> Klejna </PERSON>, they are still illegal. In July, <PERSON> Klejna </PERSON> announced that a New York-based commodity futures trading concern and three affiliates had agreed to pay a record $ 4 million to settle allegations of fraud in cocoa contracts. This year <PERSON> Klejna </PERSON> also concluded what he called the largest anti-fraud sales solicitation case the commission ever brought, with lawsuits against two commodity options firms. They were accused of misleading customers on investment risks that ran up millions of dollars in losses over five years while the firms took hefty sales commissions. <PERSON> Klejna </PERSON> has appeared uncomfortable in the glare of television lights. His voice trails off behind a thicket of microphones and he masks emotion with a stern face. Despite his ill ease with publicity, <PERSON> Klejna </PERSON> says it will be worthwhile if he shows `` the high level of commitment and professionalism from the enforcement program at this agency, which has been doing its job all along.''

<HEAD>Farmers Union, Yeutter Look at Farm Bill Differently</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> would agree that profitable, family-owned agriculture is a noble dream of American farmers. But the <ORGANIZATION> NFU </ORGANIZATION> has its own ideas how best to achieve mastery of the agricultural dream machine, and <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> has a few of his own. They're not alone. Many other agricultural and commodity organizations, individuals, analysts and special interest groups of all sorts are jockeying for position as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> works on the 1990 farm bill to replace the 1985 law. And <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> is not the only one who has a say in what the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants in the 1990 bill. Trade policy, budget requirements, White House political nit-picking and dozens of other factors litter the road ahead. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> has said repeatedly that the administration does n't have its specific farm bill proposals ready for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but hopes to outline those by the end of the year. But a look at some of <ORGANIZATION> NFU </ORGANIZATION>'s legislative desires and a few of <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s ruminations might help a bit to clarify some of the thinking as farm bill debate unfolds. Earlier this month, about 150 <ORGANIZATION> NFU </ORGANIZATION> members from 16 states, mainly in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, participated in a two-day `` fly-in'' to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that included brisk lobbying treks to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The current farm law, the Food Security Act of 1985, covers a multitude of programs, from conservation, credit and fish farming to food stamps, rural development, research and trade. But the heart of the 1985 law _ and its predecessors for more than half a century _ is the array of commodity programs that provide federal price supports and related benefits for milk, sugar, wool and major crops such as wheat, feed grains, cotton, rice and soybeans. Among other things, the 1985 law gave the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> more discretionary authority in administering commodity programs, including reductions in some of the price support benefits. A goal, supported heartily by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, was to help make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products more competitive in foreign trade. Supporters of this approach say the 1985 law has been successful in this regard. The <ORGANIZATION> NFU </ORGANIZATION> disagrees. `` Low farm prices are not the answer to our problems,'' says <ORGANIZATION> NFU </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON>. `` Low prices are the problem.'' In letters to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> NFU </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said farmers and consumers alike `` are all interested in promoting the sustainability of our natural resources, promoting the sustainability of our communities and ensuring a stable, safe food supply.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NFU </ORGANIZATION> is proposing a 10-point legislative list that features `` a voluntary supply management program'' based on using bushels or other units of production instead of acres to control crop output. It also would encourage participation in the program by offering farmers higher price support loan rates and higher target prices for base levels of crop production. These are key items that the 1985 farm law allowed to be reduced. The <ORGANIZATION> NFU </ORGANIZATION> says a bushel-based system of supply management would allow the government to `` better predict farm program costs and give farmers income protection without sacrificing crop rotation flexibility.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> also thinks there should be more flexibility for farmers to rotate crops and have more management control. `` A primary objective for the price and income support elements of the new farm bill should be to reduce the rigidity of present programs,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soybean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in July. One proposal, called the `` triple base'' plan, would limit crop deficiency payments under the target price formula _ a subsidy making up the difference between the market price and the target price for a specific crop _ to the existing base acreage or a portion of it. Farmers could then plant other crops on the remainder without losing any of their acreage base. `` Flexibility is not just a back-door way to cut target prices, as some have labeled it,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` Even though budget constraints must be addressed in all 1990 legislative proposals, greater flexibility should and can be achieved because it is the right thing to do.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NFU </ORGANIZATION> wants <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to include in the 1990 farm bill a statement `` that would reaffirm policy designed to foster and sustain the family farm system of agriculture.'' It also would recognize that the objective `` is to ensure that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers have ample quantitites of domestically produced, nutritious, safe and reasonably priced food and farm products. Such an objective is long-term and non-negotiable.'' One of the paragraphs, according to <ORGANIZATION> NFU </ORGANIZATION>, should declare that the 1990 farm bill `` must enhance, promote and be fully supportive of the family farm structure'' and `` must avoid measures which would be detrimental to family-scale operations.'' At a White House news conference on Sept. 15, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> was asked about his role and the usual perception of farmers that the secretary of agriculture is their champion. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he intends to be `` a champion for the interests of American agriculture'' and believes that he can be as vigorous and effective as anyone who has ever held the job. `` But I'm not always the champion for some of the programs that some ... would prefer to be enacted into law,'' he said. `` The question is what does one champion? And I'm going to be the champion of agricultural programs that I believe are in the best interest, the best long-term interest of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agriculture.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeon </PERSON> was so frightened the first time she read the script for `` A Cry For Help: The <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> Story'' that she could n't look at it again for a week. The <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> movie, to be broadcast Monday, tells the story of a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> woman who in 1983 was permanently crippled and almost killed by her estranged husband after police ignored her pleas for protection. `` It was a scary story for an actor to do,'' <PERSON> McKeon </PERSON> said. `` But I also felt it was too important to let go. I talked to <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> and that convinced me to do it. `` For a woman who's gone through all that, <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> is very strong,'' said <PERSON> McKeon </PERSON>. `` She has a great perspective on things. People need to see that someone who went through that can come back and have a positive attitude. People need to see there's someone that strong out there.'' The attack, in which <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> was stabbed 13 times and suffered a broken neck, left her partially paralyzed. <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>'s lawsuit against the <LOCATION> Torrington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, police prompted reforms in police response to domestic violence there. `` They told her she'd never walk, but she can walk. Her left side can work but has no feeling. Her right side does not function and is hypersensitive. Her 3-year-old son watched while his father did this to his mother. He's still trying to get through those feelings,'' <PERSON> McKeon </PERSON> said. `` This is not a fun movie. People are going to watch it and see parts of their own lives in it.'' `` The Tracey Thurman Story,'' which stars <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Midkiff </PERSON> as the husband, Buck, and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Weitz </PERSON> as <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>'s attorney, is the first time <PERSON> McKeon </PERSON> has been on the screen since the end of `` The Facts of Life'' in 1988. `` I took a year off and turned down everything,'' she said. `` I'd been on the show for eight years and every hiatus I'd done a movie I've never had any time off. I needed time to get some things into perspective. `` I traveled, I spent a lot of time with my family. When you're working everything else has to take second place You do n't want it that way, but your work comes first. I love to work. I could work all the time. I had to force myself to take time off.'' <PERSON> McKeon </PERSON> had been scheduled to star in a television series based on the hit movie `` Working Girl,'' but quit the show. She cited `` personal reasons'' for leaving the show, scheduled as a midseason replacement for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. She was to play <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> <PERSON> McGill </PERSON>, the role that brought <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> an Academy Award nomination. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> <PERSON> Katleman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Twentieth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement that a new actress would be cast in the role. <PERSON> McKeon </PERSON> will remain under contract to Twentieth to develop a television series. <PERSON> McKeon </PERSON> has been working as an actress since she was 2. Her brother, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, was on `` Alice'' and now divides his time between acting and working as an assistant director. `` I grew up in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, so I feel at home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` We lived in <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, and when they still had the tennis tournament there some of us kids ran a parking concession. We'd save spaces on the street and charge $ 5. Those were my hoodlum days. `` <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> and I did commercials and modeling in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He was in a couple of plays. I was 12 when <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> got ` <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>' and we moved here. I did n't work for a long time because nobody knew me. Then I started doing things for Aaron Spelling like ` Starsky and <PERSON> Hutch </PERSON>,' ` The Love Boat' and ` Fantasy Island.' I started ` Facts of Life' when I was 14.'' <PERSON> McKeon </PERSON> came into `` Facts of Life'' when it was revamped at the end of the first season. She played <PERSON> Jo </PERSON>, the tough kid from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>. `` I think they thought I'd play off well against <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, who was spoiled and rich,'' she said. `` I was n't too enthusiastic about doing it. I thought I'd only have about a half a line a show. Then when I got the script I saw it was a character I could play.''

<TEXT>
 It's not quite a replay although it comes close _ President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is accused of timidly yielding the diplomatic initiative to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> but insists he is n't going to be pressured into hasty offers on arms control. When that script was written, only last May, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> produced the ending, silencing his critics with a proposal for conventional arms cuts in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that upped the Soviet ante. Now the complaints are about foot-dragging on strategic arms reductions. There's no hint that the administration has a September surprise ready to match its springtime comeback. But the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> does control the agenda, and that carries with it the power to undercut <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> attacks on Bush-style diplomacy. It happened before, less than four months ago, with the same cast and similar dialogue. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got the last word and Democratic leaders had to switch overnight from complaints to applause. In both cases, Soviet officials also criticized the administration's diplomatic pace. This time, 10 days before his Thursday meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the administration had been restrained, indecisive and timid in arms talks. The White House called that complaint mystifying. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> said Monday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` must reach beyond the status quo thinking that appears to dominate administration policy.'' `` He must cast aside the ambivalence, the hesitation and the timidity and adopt a more energetic and engaged policy toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` The administration appears to have become complacent about the arms control process, trusting that the Soviets will do the work and provide the results.'' Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s comments as political talk `` When the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is rocking along with a 70 percent approval rating on his handling of foreign policy, and I were the leader of the opposition party, I might have something similar to say,'' he said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and Shevardnardze are spending the weekend in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, discussing arms control and other U.S.-Soviet issues. `` Now, will we conclude a treaty in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>? The answer to that is obviously no,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` I think if you will judge us at the end of the day, hopefully next Sunday, that you will agree that we've moved the process forward substantially across the full range of our arms control agenda.'' He said that includes strategic arms reductions, chemical weapons, and long-stalled negotiations on nuclear testing. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he also hopes the Soviets will move toward acceptance of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal that both sides cut their conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> That was the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal that stilled the earlier round of criticism, after months during which the Soviets seemed to be out-maneuvering the new administration. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced unilateral cuts in troops and weapons in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, scoring public relations points in western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was silent, awaiting a review of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. At home, the Democrats complained about the president's pace. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turned that around at the end of May, proposing conventional arms cuts with solid allied support at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. He said the offer put the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the offense and tested Soviet intent. `` We may be at an important turning point in history, one in which the security environment in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> can be transformed,'' Sen. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said at the time. Now the cycle is recurring, with a new agenda. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said anyone who thinks the administration is reluctant to move forward on strategic arms talks is misreading his intent, perhaps because the conventional arms proposal was his first priority. `` We're working inside our own administration to have proposals that I think will capture the imagination of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday. He did n't say when. `` I think we have to be careful not to become frantic and rush out here to negotiate a treaty on strategic arms, or anything else for that matter, that would be non-ratifiable,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. The president said he was in no rush to stage a summit meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. And he's calling the plays.

 <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Flippen </PERSON> was diagnosed with cancer in January, but a daily 160-mile round trip from her home to a hospital was daunting, and so was the cost of a hotel for the week of radiation treatments. <PERSON> Flippen </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Emporia </LOCATION>, was n't the only one faced with the dilemma. `` We were having patients call us from out of town saying they needed transportation into <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> for their radiation therapy and we were finding that these people were coming from long distances on a daily basis,'' said <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawls </PERSON> of the local <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` Financially it was hard on them ... physically it was hard on them.'' The society turned to the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Motel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which began offering patients free room and board. About a dozen, including <PERSON> Flippen </PERSON>, have taken advantage of the offer since the program began in March. `` I've had one patient tell me that she would not have been able to get her radiation therapy had it not been for the hotel lodging program,'' said <PERSON> Rawls </PERSON>. `` This is true of most of these patients. They could not afford to stay in a hotel Monday through Friday for eight weeks.'' <PERSON> Flippen </PERSON>, who underwent 25 radiation treatments at <ORGANIZATION> Massey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION>, has stayed at four of the two dozen participating inns. `` If it had n't been for the hotels and motels, I guess I would have just died,'' she said. `` To see them come together on something like this ... to do something good for the community in a very competitive industry is something very special,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poppell </PERSON>, executive director of the society's state chapter. `` We've talked to a lot of our counterparts across the country, and we know of no other program where it's being made available at no cost to patients.'' Each of the participating hotels agree to provide two weeks of complimentary lodging a year. Referrals come from social workers, hospitals and oncologists such as Dr. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Goplerud </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` The typical patient will have treatments of four or five weeks. They often feel tired and may suffer a loss of appetite, diarrhea and nauseau,'' he said. `` The reason they require a place to stay is because many of them live a long distance from <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> and have to come in every day for treatment. They get tired out from the long drive.'' If free lodging were n't available, <PERSON> Goplerud </PERSON> said, hospitalization or missing treatments would be the only options for some patients. `` Some would continue to commute back and forth and feel miserable.'' <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> area hotel rooms range from $ 40 to $ 90 a night, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, executive vice president for the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Motel associations, which are helping other groups set up similar programs. `` It's going to be a natural for these other organizations to pick up on this.

<HEAD>Food Allergies Implicated in Dizziness, Hearing Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Allergic reactions to foods may be responsible for dizziness, hearing loss and ringing in the ears among thousands of people who suffer a disorder called Meniere's disease, a study concludes. The study of 49 patients with the inner-ear disorder was conducted by Dr. <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Derebery </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The institute's president is Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>, former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s ear doctor The 49 underwent testing to determine their food allergies, then those foods were removed from their diets. Vertigo either was reduced or eliminated in 66 percent of the patients. Half experienced a decrease in ringing in their ears and several had dramatic improvements in hearing. The foods most commonly linked to <PERSON> Meniere </PERSON>'s disease were wheat, eggs, milk, corn, yeast and soybeans. Thousands of Americans have the disease, in which excess fluid accumulates in the labyrinth, the part of the inner ear that controls balance.

<HEAD>Scientists Fight Popcorn Lovers' Plague: Unpopped Kernels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Food engineering students cooked up 800 pounds of popcorn in an effort to combat the tooth-jarring plague that afflicts popcorn lovers everywhere: UPKs, also known as unpopped kernels. `` There are two basic problems that appear to cause an increase in UPKs and a decrease in popping volume: shelling of the kernel off the cob, and the moisture content of individual kernels at the time of popping,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckhoff </PERSON>, a food engineer at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Urbana-Champaign </ORGANIZATION>. During the summer, food engineering students using a movie theater popper found that unpopped kernels were most likely those that were too moist or too dry. Large kernels at the butt of an ear of corn have the highest moisture content; small kernels near the tip have the lowest. `` It follows, then, that companies could process kernels of uniform size to decrease the number of unpopped kernels,'' the university said. The researchers also found that if a kernel's outside covering is damaged when kernels are removed from the cob, steam ca n't build up inside the kernel. That also creates those dreaded UPKs. `` We're looking at ways to precondition the corn to loosen the attachment of the kernel to the cob so you would n't need as much mechanical force,'' <PERSON> Eckhoff </PERSON> said. `` Then you would n't damage the kernels so much.'' The research was funded by <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> @ <ORGANIZATION> Hunt-Wesson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of popcorn maker <PERSON> Orville </PERSON> <PERSON> Redenbacher </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 On the bookcase behind biologist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Milestone </PERSON>'s desk at <ORGANIZATION> Crater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> is a reminder that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is `` gravely concerned'' about geothermal development just outside the park. The park service was so concerned that drilling for heat left by a volcano might rob the lake of clarity that it paid more than $ 600,000 for a series of dives to look for hot springs. It also focused attention on deep lakes, long the neglected stepchildren of oceanography. `` It is finally begining to sink in that, gee, if we really want to know this planet, we've got to get down under not only the oceans of the world, but the fresh water as well,'' said <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Earle </PERSON>, an oceanographer and head of <ORGANIZATION> Deep </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION>, the maker of Deep Rover, a one-person submarine. `` It awaited the last couple of years, a couple of crafty -LRB- oceanographers -RRB-, the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and an issue, concern about geothermal development, to awaken people to how much we did not know,'' <PERSON> Earle </PERSON> said. In August, <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> oceanographers <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Dymond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> led 23 dives _ 13 seeking hydrothermal activity, five for geological samples and five studying biology _ to the floor of 1,932-foot-deep Lake. They're convinced hot springs exist but did n't find conclusive proof. They will spend a year on a report to help determine whether <ORGANIZATION> Crater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> stays on a list of national parks with significant thermal features. If it does, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> could block geothermal development to protect the lake. What <PERSON> Dymond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> did find were mysterious blue pools of dense salty water on the bottom laden with carbon dioxide and radon; fluffy orange mats of iron-eating bacteria; elevated temperatures in rock anchoring the bacteria and rust-colored spires resembling stalagmites. At the deepest point of the lake, park biotechnician <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Buktenica </PERSON> found tiny craters and a midge fly larva. Last year, <PERSON> Earle </PERSON> found ordinary green moss growing at the freshwater record depth of 725 feet. `` Part of it is the clarity of the water, but I think there may be more to it than that,'' said oceanographer <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Monterey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquarium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Indian legends ascribe the formation of <LOCATION> Crater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> to a battle between <LOCATION> Llao </LOCATION>, god of the underworld, and <PERSON> Skell </PERSON>, god of the surface world. Geologists date the cataclysmic eruption of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mazama </LOCATION> to 6,850 years ago. The volcano collapsed, leaving a `` caldera'' that filled with rain and melted snow and became a world standard for lake clarity. Scientists became concerned that the lake was losing clarity and in 1982, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ordered a 10-year study. The clouding appears to be cause by growth in the population of microscopic plants called phytoplankton. The <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> discounts a theory that nitrates from a septic system on the rim were feeding the plankton, but is going to remove the system anyway. <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> filed leases just outside the park in the <ORGANIZATION> Winema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> and in 1986 began drilling in search of geothermal energy. The company says it would be impossible for its work to affect the lake. <PERSON> Dymond </PERSON> began studying the lake in 1984. `` We found these unusual chemical and temperature variations at that time.'' Findings of a helium isotope he had seen in conjunction with ocean hot springs bolstered the theory that hot springs could be bubbling up through a crack ringing the lake bottom, producing heat and salts that stir up the lake. A remote-controlled submersible made five dives in 1987. On one, <PERSON> Dymond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> saw what looked like a plume of smoke curling up from a crack, but they failed to get a temperature reading or a water sample for proof. They returned last year for the first dives in Deep Rover. Navigation problems plagued them, and after 17 dives they were unable to claim more than encouraging evidence. This year, a system called ultra-short baseline acoustic navigation, which uses sound waves from four ground stations to locate the sub in three dimensions, cured the echo problems. On Aug. 19, <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> piloted Deep Rover to a depth of 1,400 feet in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, where hydrothermal explorations were concentrated, and poked a probe into a bacterial mat, where it registered 61 degrees Fahrenheit. Three days later, navigator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> of Land and Sea Surveys peered into the colored plots on his computer screen and directed <PERSON> Dymond </PERSON> back to the area, where he found a temperature of 63.9 degrees Fahrenheit in another mat. The temperatures met the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey test for a thermal spring _ 18 degrees higher than the mean annual air temperature at the surface, which is 37.8 degrees. The water at the lake bottom is 38.3 degrees. `` So it is a thermal spring in some sense,'' said <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> engineer <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathenson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Whether it's a `` significant thermal feature'' as required by law `` is a judgment call by the secretary of the Interior.'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Energy geologist <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFleur </PERSON> is skeptical and suggests that any flow at the lake bottom comes from cold mineral seeps. `` Certainly an objective scientist would have to appreciate that nothing they have found would have any significant effect on the lake,'' he said. Though the bacteria mats suggest something is flowing, <PERSON> Dymond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> could n't see it or devise any way to measure it. They hope other data will show some fluid seeping through bottom sediments. One significant finding was made by <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, a geochemist at the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanography </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>., whose team measured the amount of freon in the water at the bottom of the lake, and found it had been at the surface just three years ago <PERSON> Nathenson </PERSON> said it appears the lake is like a layer cake, with the top layer turning over like a normal lake in the spring and the fall, and a series of thinner layers mixing from one to the other to the bottom. In this way oxygen works down from the top and heat and salts work up from the bottom. <PERSON> Dymond </PERSON> said the blue pools, one of which he dubbed Llao's Bathtub, could be the source of unexplained salts found in the lake Those found in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> have no apparent source; others found on the north side of the lake appear to be fed by tiny streams that pop out from under rocks. Excited by their successes, <PERSON> Dymond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> are talking about expeditions to other deep lakes. First on their dream list is <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baikal </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, the deepest in the world at 5,315 feet. `` ` We are continually amazed,'' <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> said, `` at how little is known about deep lakes.''

<HEAD>Trade Ministry Plans Tax Incentives to Boost Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade ministry is considering tax incentives for companies that boost imports as a way to correct its $ 52 billion trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, officials said. `` We realize that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> accounts for half of the total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit and therefore we are trying to vigorously increase our imports,'' <PERSON> Yuzuru </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatakeyama </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters Wednesday. <PERSON> Hatakeyama </PERSON>, director general of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, said the ministry is considering a plan to grant special tax incentives for importers. During <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s industrial buildup after its defeat in World War II, incentives granted to exporters allowed them to reduce their taxes by from 1 percent to 3 percent of the value of their exports. The system was discontinued in 1964. <PERSON> Hatakeyama </PERSON> said the government is considering a similar system to promote imports. The tax breaks would not extend to importers of raw materials, he said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is under pressure from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to increase its imports and institute other economic and trade policy changes to cut its surplus. Earlier this month, the two countries began a yearlong round of bimonthly talks on structural impediments to trade in each nation, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said they expect `` measurable'' improvement in the trade imbalance by next spring. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> also has been named, along with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, as a possible target of retaliation under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade laws for policies that allegedly hinder the sale here of supercomputers, lumber products and satellites. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, in a three-day visit to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last week, welcomed the idea of tax incentives to Japanese importers as a far-reaching method of increasing imports and cutting the trade imbalance. Total Japanese imports have risen 16.5 percent in the first eight months of this year, and imports from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have increased by 19.9 percent from the same period last year, the trade ministry says. The senior trade official said the proposed tax breaks are not likely to be implemented until next spring at the earliest, since <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> would have to approve legislation. But <PERSON> Hatakeyama </PERSON> admitted the tax breaks could take even longer because of political uncertainties. Plagued by a series of scandals and an unpopular new sales tax, the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lost its majority in the upper house of Parliament in July for the first time in 34 years. A general election for the more powerful lower house must be held by next summer. It is not clear whether the proposed tax incentives would be legal under rules of the international trade body known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. `` But we hope no countries would complain about this scheme,'' <PERSON> Hatakeyama </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s securities market watchdog have announced a tentative mutal assistance agreement. The announcement Wednesday came in a joint communique issued by <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Piga </PERSON>, Chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Commissione </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nazionale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Per </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societa </ORGANIZATION>' e la Borsa -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> CONSOB </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-.

The communique was described as `` an interim understanding'' between the two agencies to provide the fullest mutal assistance permitted by law or regulation in their countries to exchange information that will help each agency oversee markets, conduct investigations and prosecute wrongdoers in their own jurisdictions. `` It is in the best interest of all nations to expose and prosecute those who would abuse the integrity of the securities markets,'' the two-page agreement said. It noted that Italian transactions in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporate securities grew from about $ 269 million in 1985 to $ 1.8 billion in 1988. Conversely, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> transactions in Italian corporate stock increased from about $ 457 million to some $ 656 million over the same period. Both agencies `` contemplate that it will be a preliminary step to a more expansive and comprehensive memorandum of understanding'' after they obtain the legal authority to do so, the communique said.

During the past two years, profits from <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s European operations have risen, to $ 1.46 billion last year, while <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> American earnings have fallen. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, which has a number of European assembly plants, is n't the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker moving to increase its presence in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> before 1992. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the vehicle-making arm of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that the No. 3 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker has developed a network of 770 dealers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The company recently introduced U.S-made versions of the <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spirit </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acclaim </ORGANIZATION> to the European market, he added. He said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s European sales would reach 100,000 annually in a few years. While that's far behind <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s 1.7 million in European car and truck sales last year, it marks a return to the European market for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> sold its European plants more than a decade ago when it encountered financial trouble that led to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government bailout. In February, it announced it would return to European production through a joint venture with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> to build a sport-utility vehicle, now named the `` JJ,'' at plants yet to be disclosed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sold 1.45 million vehicles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> last year through its <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> began exporting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cars to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in 1911 and started making cars on the continent in the early 1920s. It now has seven assembly and 30 component plants in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> owns all of Group <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and has a <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> joint truck venture with <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers must have assembly capabilities in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> when the trade barriers fall in about two years, <PERSON> Sudol </PERSON> said. `` It will be a fortress <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and if they have no manufacturing over there, they will have to jump over a high tariff wall,'' she said.

<HEAD>Major Airlines Ponder American's Proposed Fare Hike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's major airlines are pondering whether they should match an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> proposal that would raise some discount fares by more than 15 percent and double cancellation penalties. The increases proposed by American, one of the largest carriers, would take effect Sept. 29. They would follow a recent rise in a type of discount fare popular with business travelers, reflecting an effort by airlines to partly recoup revenue lost from bargain fares offered this summer to fall vacationers. Spokesmen for competitors of Dallas-based American said Wednesday those airlines were considering matching the increases but had n't decided `` I think there are several carriers out there that are inclined to match,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Starkman </PERSON>, an airline analyst at the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Under American's proposal, the popular `` MaxSaver'' cut-rate fare often used by vacationers, which must be purchased 14 days in advance, would be increased by $ 10 to $ 20 per round trip. A `` MaxSaver'' ticket on American between <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, for example, would go from $ 338 to $ 358 round trip. The `` MaxSaver'' tickets would remain non-refundable. In addition, American would raise fares on seven-day-advance tickets by $ 30 to $ 60 round trip. The same <PERSON> Dallas-Los </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeles </PERSON> round trip ticket bought seven days in advance would go from $ 378 to $ 438. The penalty for changing or canceling a reservation would double to 50 percent of the ticket price. `` We're trying to get the yields up,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotard </PERSON>, a spokesman for American. An airline's yield, which reflects the average revenue from passengers for each mile flown, is the lifeblood of the competitive air transport industry. <PERSON> Starkman </PERSON>, like many industry analysts, is expecting little improvement in yields overall for the rest of the year and into 1990. In mid-August, the airlines announced steep fare cuts for the fall, extending summer travel bargains. They slashed round-trip fares by as much as $ 160 to lure passengers in the historically weak autumn season. Most fares to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were reduced by $ 100 into next spring. Last week, in an effort to recover some of the losses, the airlines boosted `` Supercoach'' one-way fares by about $ 20 for a one-way ticket. These fares are favored by business fliers because they have more lenient advance-purchase requirements than cheaper discount fares and do n't require a Saturday-night stay. Spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday those airlines were studying American's proposal but had n't decided if they will match it. If they do n't follow suit, it would be difficult for American to raise the fares alone and remain competitive. But <PERSON> Hotard </PERSON> said the airline planned to go ahead next week, in any case. American also announced Wednesday an increase in service from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to become a larger competitor in that market, historically dominated by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which has been hobbled by a prolonged strike. American's efforts to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Latin American route network recently collapsed when <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> decided not to sell it. But American officials said the airline would seek government approval for routes on its own.

<HEAD>Chase Manhattan Raises Loan-Loss Reseves, Takes Big 3rd Qtr Hit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has become the second major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank this week to strengthen itself against problem Third World debt, reflecting a growing realization among bankers that the money lent years ago may never be fully repaid. In a major recapitalization plan announced Wednesday, <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> said it would add $ 1.15 billion to its loan-loss reserves in the third quarter and issue $ 500 million in new common stock. The move is expected to result in a loss of more than $ 1 billion in the quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it would add $ 950 million to its reserves and also issue up to $ 500 million in common stock. But unlike <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>, it is raising much-needed capital by selling a controlling interest in its financial services unit, <ORGANIZATION> CIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, and a 4.9 percent equity stake to <ORGANIZATION> Dai-Ichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kangyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the world's largest bank, for about $ 1.4 billion. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> said it would have an after-tax charge totaling $ 1.26 billion in the third quarter, which would result in a net loss of $ 1.12 billion for the period. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> said it did n't have an earnings estimate for the full year. For the first six months of 1989, <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> earned $ 269 million, or $ 2.57 per share, vs. $ 501 million, or $ 5.53 a share, a year earlier. Included in Chase's after-tax charge is the $ 1.15 billion addition for the loan-loss reserve, an $ 85 million charge reflecting the lower value of problem real estate assets in <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> banking subsidiary and a $ 25 million charge relating to securities trading activities. `` The basic core earnings of the bank have been going well but they have been masked by these three drags,'' Chairman <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> told a news conference. Butcher said the actions would eliminate a current after-tax earnings drag of about $ 200 million a year. `` This will result in Chase entering the 1990s with renewed financial strength and enhanced earnings potential,'' he said. Chase, with $ 100 billion in assets, is the second largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank behind <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, which has assets of more than $ 210 billion. The Chase announcement came after the close of trading Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Chase was up $ 1.62 -LCB- at $ 39.50 a share before trading was halted late in the day. Some industry analysts predicted the market would act favorably to <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>'s actions. `` It's a big step for <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Keefe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bruyette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>. `` By stepping up and taking a big hit and getting the problem into a different zone, it's going to allow for greater focus on its core earnings base.'' With the big charge, <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>'s total reserve for possible credit losses at the end of the third quarter will be about $ 3.7 billion. This includes about $ 2.9 billion for loans to developing nations, or about 46 percent of Chase's total $ 6.2 billion of medium - and long-term loans to Third World countries The ratio had been 26 percent. The major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> money center banks generally have loan loss reserves equalling roughly a third of their outstanding Third World loans. Chase's new reserve ratio will lead the pack. Major banks have been under increasing pressure lately to boost their reserves to cover Third World debt in the aftermath of the recent <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> debt agreement and the plan by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> that emphasizes bank forgiveness of these accounts. `` This action resulted from our ongoing review of economic and political conditions and our belief that recent developments, including the Brady initiative, have resulted in increased pressure on banks to reduce their claims ... and an increased resistance on the part of some lesser developed nations to meet their contractual obligations,'' <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> said. He said the pressure `` has become apparent in the now-completed <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> negotiations and the negotiating positions announced by other countries.'' Chase's new stock issuance amounts to about 14 million shares. As of June 30, Chase had 90.2 million common shares outstanding. The charge involving the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> subsidiary reflects the continuing economic downturn in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. By establishing the provision for the real estate loans and foreclosed property, <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> anticipates improvement in the core earnings in that area. After-tax losses for the first half of 1989 for that subsidiary totalled $ 30 million. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> said it lost $ 25 million after taxes in the first half from securities trading. It said the third-quarter charge reflected its decision to get out of market-making in British government bonds and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mortgage-backed securities.

<HEAD>Adobe Strikes Back in Battle Over Computer Typefaces</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Adobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is hoping to keep <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> from stealing its thunder in a battle over typefaces that has the computer industry's biggest names choosing sides. Adobe said Wednesday it would take the unusual step of making public some valuable technical information about the way its PostScript software creates letters, numbers and other figures on a page. That step, while helping <ORGANIZATION> Adobe </ORGANIZATION>'s competitors, should confirm the Adobe system as an industry standard and deal a blow to a joint effort by <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to create a new standard, analysts said. The seemingly obscure battle will affect the course of desktop publishing, which makes it possible for personal computer owners to create professional-looking documents and publications using special software and laser printers. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warnock </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Adobe </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, chief executive and co-founder, announced the decision to publish PostScript specifications in an emotional speech at a conference in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. He said he feared <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s unspecific plans for new software amounted to `` vaporware'' that could jeopardize a valuable existing standard. <ORGANIZATION> Steve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jobs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Next </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> lined up on the side of Adobe at the <ORGANIZATION> Seybold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> and Exposition, while <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> sided with Apple. `` This is like a soap opera. It's melodrama at its best,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlynn </PERSON>, marketing manager for the <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> printer division of <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview from the conference. An agreed-upon standard makes things easier for makers of computers, printers and new typefaces as well as computer users. With Adobe's announcement, companies that already use PostScript may decide to stick with it instead of spending their efforts on the Apple-Microsoft plans, analysts said. `` A lot of people think this is a very good move,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He said customers attending the conference `` overwhelmingly'' indicated in a show of hands that they would stick with Adobe. Adobe's stock was hurt Wednesday by the Apple-Microsoft combination, which came after the close of trading Tuesday, but helped by <ORGANIZATION> Adobe </ORGANIZATION>'s counterploy. It closed the day off 37 -LCB- cents at $ 19.75 in over-the-counter trading. Adobe, of <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> View </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, rose rapidly in recent years to dominate the software that goes into laser printers and controls their output. Apple, which had been <ORGANIZATION> Adobe </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest customer, signalled its intention to go its own way earlier this year when it sold its 16 percent stake in Adobe. Apple and <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>, which are battling each other in an unrelated copyright suit, set aside their differences Tuesday to announce they would swap technology on advanced printer fonts. The plan is for Macintosh computers and IBM-type computers using <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> base software to have identical font capabilities. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said the plan is to improve upon PostScript. But he acknowledged that the improvements could render the two sets of software incompatible. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Seybold </PERSON>, the host of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> conference, predicted that the first software from that alliance would not be shipped before 1991. Adobe's president, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Geschke </PERSON>, said in a phone interview that the company had planned to publish the PostScript specifications within a matter of months anyway but speeded up its plans in hopes of keeping the industry standard from splitting.

 <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> are talking to an unidentified publishing company about selling the 8-year-old magazine, and a media industry newsletter identified it as Reader's <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipstein </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday the partnership was `` having discussions'' about selling the magazine, but refused to identify the prospective <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsletter </ORGANIZATION> reported that sources it did not identify were saying Reader's <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> had an agreement in principle for the deal. <PERSON> Lipstein </PERSON> said he would neither confirm nor deny the report, and a spokesman for Reader's <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said his company could not comment. `` We have not made any announcement, and we ca n't discuss any subject that has not been announced,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trachtenberg </PERSON> from company headquarters in <LOCATION> Pleasantville </LOCATION>. As a private company, he said Reader's Digest usually does n't comment on its business plans He noted the company is currently operating under added regulatory constraints because it is preparing to file registration material that will enable some of its shareholders to offer non-voting stock to the public for the first time. The filing is expected by early 1990. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> magazine is published 10 times a year and has seen both circulation and advertising pages rise this year. `` It's doing very well,'' said <PERSON> Lipstein </PERSON>, a founder of the magazine and the largest stockholder in the partnership that owns it. He said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>'s ad pages have risen 12.4 percent this year from a year ago and circulation is up 10 percent to an all-time high of 1.048 million. <PERSON> Lipstein </PERSON> is also involved in separate partnerships that own Mother Earth News, Psychology Today and Smart magazines, but said these were not for sale. Reader's <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has been publishing Reader's Digest for nearly 68 years and in the past three years has acquired three special interest magazines: Travel-Holiday, The Family Handyman and New Choices for The Best Years, which had formerly been called 50-Plus. Reader's Digest also publishes general and condensed books and produces and markets by direct mail a variety of home entertainment products including compact discs, tapes, records and home videos. In an announcement Wednesday, the company said it was creating three new business groups and named presidents for each of them. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grune </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive, said the realignment was part of a `` continuing growth strategy ... designed to maximize our position as a leader in the global publishing and direct mail industries.'' Two of the executives come from within the organization. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohane </PERSON>, who has been with the company since 1971, becomes president of the new direct marketing group, and <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a 29-year veteran, was picked to head the new international group. <PERSON> Bohane </PERSON>, 53, had been vice president and director of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marketing for Reader's <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and in the new post will be responsible for domestic direct mail activities for book, music and home video products and financial services. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, 52, had been vice president and director for international operations and will oversee Reader's Digest activities outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>, 42, who has more than 15 years in the magazine field for companies including <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, becomes president of the new magazine publishing group with responsibility for all four magazines and the <ORGANIZATION> QSP </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, which helps schools and youth organizations with fundraising.

 Another round of auto plant closings is looming for the 1990s, but nothing should happen in the next year despite an expected drop in vehicle sales, a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executive says. `` There absolutely will be more plant closings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. `` If over a period of time market demand is insufficient, then we would be forced to realign capacity.'' <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s vehicle-making arm, predicted that 14.2 million vehicles _ 9.4 million cars and 4.8 million light trucks _ will be sold in 1990. That will be down 4 percent to 5 percent from 1989 sales and 10.1 percent below the 15.8 million vehicles sold in 1988, the second-best year in automotive history. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 3 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carmaker, closed its <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, assembly plant last year. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced it would shut its <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, assembly plant in March. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has n't recently announced any plant closings. `` Over the'90s, the market is not going to grow sufficiently to absorb all the capacity,'' <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> said. A large percentage of the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaking capacity in recent years has come from `` transplants,'' or foreign-based companies operating assembly plants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Recently, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> increased capacity at its <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, plant; <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> began production at their joint-venture plant in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>; a cooperative venture between <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Ltd. of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> opened in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> began operating in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> begins production at a second <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plant later this year in East Liberty, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> join together for production later this year at <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. All three companies are Japanese. All that adds up to a lot more production capacity for cars and trucks. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is using less than 30 percent of the capacity at its <ORGANIZATION> Bramalea </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, plant but that will rise next year when the company begins building a new <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monaco </ORGANIZATION>, derived from the Eagle Premier it assembles there now. On other matters raised Wednesday as <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> wound up its 1990 model introduction, <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> said: _ The 2,300 white-collar jobs <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> tagged for extinction in a $ 1 billion cost-cutting program should be gone by the end of the year, as expected _ The minivan market segment will continue to grow <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s dominant 56 percent share will slip a little, mainly because of the entry of new minivans, including those from <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s 5 percent average price increase for 1990 cars and trucks was due mainly to the company's decision to put driver-side air bags on all of its U.S.-made cars to meet federal safety standards

<HEAD>Amerada Hess Confirms Refinery Damage from Hurricane</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amerada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has confirmed that its big <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> refinery sustained major hurricane damage and will not resume full operations for about 60 days. The company said in a statement after the markets closed Wednesday that `` there had been considerable damage to the plant and to its administrative buildings and employees' housing.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> company said the refinery, with a capacity of 545,000 barrels a day, would resume partial operations in about 30 days. The refinery supplies markets in the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Reports that there might be major problems at the refinery sent gasoline futures surging Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The October contract for unleaded gasoline closed 2.07 cents higher at 59.74 cents a gallon after trading as high as 60.20 cents. Heating oil for October delivery jumped 1.60 cents to 56.55 cents a gallon. Other contract months also had strong gains. An <PERSON> Amerada </PERSON> spokesman said the refinery had been shut down Saturday in preparation for Hurricane Hugo. The refinery had been producing about 400,000 barrels a day of gasoline, distillates and other products, most of which are used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said the official, who asked that his name not be used. He said <PERSON> Amerada </PERSON> officials traveled to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> to inspect the refinery earlier in the week but that damage from the hurricane made communication out of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> difficult. <PERSON> Amerada </PERSON> said despite the shutdown it planned to maintain `` normal sales arrangements with all of its customers on the mainland of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Traders said the strength in product prices helped buoy crude oil prices. The October contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, rose 8 cents to close at $ 19.64 a 42-gallon barrel. November crude rose 29 cents to $ 19.68 and December jumped 32 cents to $ 19.46 a barrel. Energy analysts said the small gains in October crude on the last trading day of the contract reflected the market's belief that it was oversold. `` Buyers decided they ca n't justify paying the price,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Traders said the market started out relatively calm until gasoline prices surged early in the day on word that <PERSON> Amerada </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> was buying large amounts of oil and gasoline in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> markets to make up for the shortfall from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> But some analysts said they were surprised by the strong buying activity given the recent buildup of inventories, particularly gasoline. `` It's hard to see why we had this kind of move,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. The latest weekly report by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> showed gasoline stocks rose 244,000 barrels in the week ended Sept. 15. Distillate stocks rose more than 1.6 million barrels while crude supplies fell 9.6 million barrels. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> report indicates that the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> refinery provides only about 50,000 barrels a day of gasoline to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets, while the rest of its production is composed of products such as distillates.

<HEAD>Bush Rejects Colombian Plea on Coffee Quotas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has rejected a plea by Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> for a 1-year reinstatement of a coffee-export quota system that had been beneficial to Colombian farmers, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said. Colombian coffee prices have fallen sharply since the 74-nation <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agreement </ORGANIZATION> _ to which both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> belonged _ collapsed in July after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pulled out in a dispute over prices with coffee-producing nations. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, whose nation relies on coffee as a major source of export earnings, had appealed to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to reconsider the coffee decision and to support reinstating the quotas for at least one year. But the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that the decision would stand. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s coffee earnings have slumped at the same time that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is seeking Barco's help in cracking down on cocaine exports. Colombian officials have suggested they will have an even harder time persuading hard-pressed Colombian farmers to grow coffee instead of coca if coffee export prices continue to slip. The agreement set quotas for member nations' exports aimed at suporting prices of beans at $ 1.20 per pound or more. Some Central American nations and others, supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, wanted larger quotas. After suspension of the quotas in early July, prices fell quickly to about 85 cents a pound. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has said this will cost $ 500 million a year in export revenue. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was ready to negotiate for a new quota system but was unwilling to adhere to the now-defunct agreement, presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s letter was one `` expressing appreciation of the importance of coffee to the economies of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and other developing countries.'' The letter, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> continued, `` expressed his -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s -RRB- disappointment that the members of the <ORGANIZATION> ICA </ORGANIZATION> were unable to settle ... two fundamental problems.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wanted an increase in export quotas for higher-quality coffees enjoyed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers, and tough penalties against countries secretly selling coffee surpluses to Eastern bloc nations at prices below those charged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expresses his confidence that a lasting solution which is acceptable to other major members and respects market trends can be found,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s letter may have opened the way for negotiations on restoring coffee export quotas, a Colombian representative said. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s plea, he also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was prepared to resume discussions on quotas at any time. Possibilities for restoring the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s export quota system may be explored next week at a week-long session of the 74-member group. `` The aim will be to maintain the momentum towards an economic agreement for coffee that brings back export quotas,'' <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Osorio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s permanent coffee organization delegate, said in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` The council will look at the market situation and could set a timetable for negotiations,'' he added. Coffee prices have dropped by more than 30 percent since the <ORGANIZATION> ICO </ORGANIZATION> export quota system was suspended on July 4, and prices touched a 14-year low of less than 67 cents per pound last month. Allowing for inflation, coffee is now at its lowest level since the 1920s.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> has signed investment and tourism agreements and extended his stay to negotiate a pact to persuade American companies to do business in the new <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The proposed accord would address the concerns of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies considering investing in the economically and politically volatile country, which has the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's only non-communist-led government. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> and Polish Foreign Trade Minister <PERSON> Marcin </PERSON> <PERSON> Swiecicki </PERSON> are discussing how far the new government is willing to go to increase Western investment through a series of favorable agreements. The pacts would address removing profits from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, offer guarantees against expropriation of property, protect technology, patents and other intellectual property, and govern taxation. `` I think this will add confidence and comfort and a level of excitement for American businesses and bring more ... to invest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s visit, which he extended by a day until today, comes as Poles are looking to the West for support of the new government's efforts to dismantle four decades of communist rule amid what Solidarity Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> calls `` economic chaos. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Democrats contending the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is failing to back the reforms have proposed a $ 1.8 billion aid plan that would dwarf a $ 100 million package offered so far by the White House. Neither the comprehensive `` Business and Economic Agreement'' under discussion nor the agreements signed Wednesday has any significant cost to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said. But they do represent a largely unprecedented encouragement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commerce with a communist country in transition. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> on Wednesday and said it will likely be some time before the benefits of investment are felt. `` The Americans propose that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> reduce inflation first and then they will provide us with some specific help,'' he said. `` I think I managed to persuade -LRB- <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> -RRB- that it should be the other way around because I am sure that without this help we will not make it,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` It would be a vicious circle.'' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Swiecicki </PERSON>, one of four remaining communist cabinet members, signed an agreement to foster contact between American business and the developing private sector in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Under the pact, business experts will be brought to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and management training programs will be developed for an economy in which companies have been run by a centralized bureaucracy. The other agreement is to improve tourism and expand opportunities for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in hotels and other travel projects in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> stayed at the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, expected to open next month in a skyscraper that was unfinished most of the decade due to lack of funds. The project is considered a prime example and key test of the potential for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment. Tourists now have legal access to a more favorable exchange rate that had been only available only on the black market until currency laws were changed earlier in the year. But they still are required to exchange set amounts and pay for lodging and other services at the lower `` official'' exchange rate. A series of programs now before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> include a $ 100 million fund to promote development of private firms in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the rewriting of tariff laws to allow 4,100 products to be imported to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> without tariffs. About $ 70 million of current Polish exports would be covered, including furniture and light machinery.

<HEAD>Wage and Price Trends Point to Productivity Increase: Survey</HEAD>

 Wage and price projections point toward increased productivity by salaried workers in 1990, according to a private study that found salary increases lagging behind inflation this year. The survey of 1,260 businesses indicates the companies plan to give slightly bigger raises next year while inflation is expected to ease a bit. With higher compensation costs in an atmosphere of greater price restraint, employers will likely demand more from their employees, said <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an executive with <ORGANIZATION> Hewitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, which released its study Wednesday. <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>, a compensation consulting firm based in suburban <LOCATION> Lincolnshire </LOCATION>, asked a cross-section of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses how much they increased their budgets for salaries in 1989 and how much more they expected to budget in 1990. The companies projected increases averaging 5.4 percent next year while the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is projecting an increase of 4.2 percent in a consumer price index that tracks the prices of goods and services bought by urban wage earners and clerical workers. Those projections compare with salary increases averaging 5.3 percent this year while inflation for wage earners and clerical workers is running at an annualized rate of 5.1 percent through August, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The increased income taxes on the 5.3 percent raises will more than offset the apparent edge over inflation, so salaried workers will actually lose some purchasing power this year for the second year in a row, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The loss of spending power is `` small, but significant,'' he said. `` It's more of a statistical concept than something the average person is going to feel. But if it continues over time, you're going to feel it.'' The projected loss of purchasing power extends a pattern established in 1988, the first year this decade in which inflation outstripped the average rise in salaried workers' take-home pay, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The survey did not include wage increases for union workers, who comprise 16.8 percent of the work force, according to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures. On the brighter side, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said an increasing number of companies are shifting compensation dollars to bonus plans or other incentive programs that reward salaried employees for achieving stated goals. `` For a large number of salaried workers there is a second source of earnings,'' he said. The Consumer Price Index used in <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>'s study, known as CPI-W, is a narrower indicator of inflation than the more widely cited CPI-U index, which tracks the prices of products purchased by all urban consumers, not just wage earners and clerical workers. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> CPI-U </ORGANIZATION> index shows inflation running at an annualized rate of 4.8 percent through August. The salary increases in <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>'s study are substantially greater than those reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for wage and salary earners in private industry because the government's numbers include hourly and union workers, whose raises are typically smaller than those of salaried workers. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said wages for those workers rose 3.3 percent in 1987, 4.1 percent in 1988 and 4.1 percent through August of this year.

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> retailers have fared better than their <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> rivals this year and sales at chain stores in oil-patch states have grown faster than elsewhere in the country, according to a new report. Department stores and discounters in the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, metropolitan area posted the best sales gain for the first half of 1989 while <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> retailers suffered the worst decline. These were among the findings in a regional retail sales report based on results from 6,000 stores, with at least 25 employees each, in the 125 largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> metropolitan areas. The stores account for $ 110 billion in annual sales. The retailers, which regularly submit sales figures to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, include such national chains as <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, mass merchants and department stores Using data collected by the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shopping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> is compiling a new monthly report that complements other government retail sales publications. The premier issue, released Wednesday, covered sales for June and the first 6 months of 1989. <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagnado </PERSON>, director of research for the shopping center trade group, said the report indicates a region's health because consumer spending at general merchandise stores is a key element of economic activity. Nationwide, consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>, a retail industry analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference that the new reports will help analysts determine store traffic trends and sales momentum, which are crucial factors in assessing a retailer's prospects. According to the report for January through June, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> or `` oil patch'' area of the country, including parts of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, had a sales gain of 11.2 percent for the first half from the corresponding 1988 period. The increase was by far the best of any region and compared with a national median increase of 4.5 percent. `` Since the oil-dominated economies have suffered through an extended widespread economic contraction, a recent turnaround has apparently been sufficient to usher in a wave of consumer spending,'' the report read. The West had a 6.3 percent sales gain in the first half of 1989. On the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, the south <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> states showed a growth rate of only 1.3 percent and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> states trailed all other divisions within geographic regions, with a 2.6 percent drop in sales. In the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, the report said department store sales rose 4.3 percent in the first six months of the year from a year earlier but accelerated in the second quarter, posting a rise of 5.3 percent. Among specific metropolitan areas <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> had a sales rise of 18.7 percent in the first half of 1989 to lead gainers, while <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> sales fell by 8 percent to lead the decliners.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel has passed legislation that would increase <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> funding by $ 70 million over the next two years and lift salary caps for <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> staffers. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Banking, Housing and <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved a package of SEC-realted legislation without amendements and little discussion on Wednesday. In addition to increasing the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s budget for 1990 and 1991, the proposed package would let the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> lift caps on employee salary, especially crucial entry level staff attorney posts. Most other federal financial regulators were given that authority by the savings and loan bailout bill passed earlier this year. At his confirmation hearing before the same committee last week, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's nominee for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> chairmanship, said raising staff pay was one of his top priorities. `` We do n't want a thrift crisis in the securities markets,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., chairman of the subcommittee that drew up the legislation Noting the high turnover rate caused by salaries that are not competitive with the private sector, <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> added: `` We simply must have an agency that has the funds and expert staff to keep our markets clean and keep them sound.'' The legislative package must still clear the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. `` The passage of these bills as well as the lifting of the pay caps at the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> is long overdue,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the committee chairman. `` I do not anticipate any difficulties enacting this legislation into law,'' the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Democrat added. The packages also calls for action that would: _ bolster the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to fight international fraud by allowing the commission to guarantee the confidentiality of documents provided by foreign regulators in <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> probes; _ extend to mutual fund shareholders, the protection of the shareholder communications act, which equires banks and brokers to notify shareholders about proxy materials and other documents not sent directly to the individual; _ streamline the law regulating the disclosure language for the issuance of The package of four bills was passed by voice vote with little discussion. Under the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> reauthorization bill, the agency which oversees the stock and bond markets, stock exchanges and other aspects of the securities industry, would get $ 178 million for 1990 and $ 212.6 million for the following year. By contrast, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> budget for 1989 was $ 142.6 million. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said it may be the panel's `` most important single task'' in the securities field. `` We can pass countless laws against insider trading or market abuses, but we need an expert agency to administer and enforce those laws,'' he added.

 The former head of <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heileman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says he is discouraged by the company's troubles since it was acquired by Australian <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, but he declined to speculate whether the country's fifth-largest brewer might be sold again. `` It's unfortunate,'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crosse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON> is based. `` I certainly hope they get their act straightened out for the sake of the employees.'' <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON> said he would not speculate on whether <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON> might be sold. A spokesman for <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON> referred calls to <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, but officials there could not be reached for comment. `` It's a tough business and he has an enormous amount of debt,'' <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON> said. `` We did n't have that debt.'' Through a series of acquisitions, <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON> built <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON> into a national power before it was bought by <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> in 1987 for about $ 1.3 billion. But the purchase of <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON> has contributed to <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>'s mounting debts, which reportedly exceed $ 4 billion. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> announced he was selling half of his brewery empire to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nathan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, for more than $ 760 million Under the transaction, <PERSON> Lion </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> will buy a 50 percent interest in and management of <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s Swan, Tooheys and <ORGANIZATION> Castlemaine </ORGANIZATION> breweries in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, and the group's hotel and associated liquor interests. <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said in a statement that the brewery deal was `` another positive step in the restructuring and strategic refocusing'' of his group. He said it would create a `` formidable brewing alliance'' in the region, aimed at the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Under the proposal, the brewing assets will be folded into a new joint venture company, <ORGANIZATION> Australian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Breweries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pty </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, equally owned by <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lion </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>. Bond deferred for 12 months any decision to part with <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON>. Analysts say, however, <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> is bound to lose money whether he sells <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON> or decides to keep it. `` Heileman today is to some extent painted in a corner,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, a professor of marketing management at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` The question is whether you operate it and bleed a little or take a big hit and move on,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Collopy </PERSON>, an industry analyst and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Cleary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reiland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McDevitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Collopy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. While the overall beer market has stagnated, <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON>'s share has eroded, falling from a high of 9.4 percent in 1983 to a current level of about 7 percent. Industry observers say <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON> was worth far below $ 1.3 billion when it was sold, and <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> would have a hard time finding a buyer. `` You're not getting anyone to pay $ 1.3 billion for the breweries,'' said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinman </PERSON>, associate publisher of Beer Marketer's Insights, an industry newsletter. Analysts point out that <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON>'s sales started to slip before the company was sold, but <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON> was able to keep the company efficient and profitable. `` His helmsmanship helped hold it together better than anyone could,'' <PERSON> Collopy </PERSON> said. `` When you lose that, the underlying softness got exaggerated.''

<HEAD>Government Clears Hoylake's Offer For BAT</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government today cleared <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 21 billion bid for the British conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. The decision follows last week's ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> Panel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Takeovers </ORGANIZATION> and Mergers allowing <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> to suspend its all-paper bid until it resolves regulatory problems with state insurance commissioners in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Thursday's approval came in the form of a decision by Trade Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> not to refer the bid to the <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. However, the notice from <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> said the matter could be reconsidered if there is a `` material change'' in the terms of the bid or other `` material facts.'' BAT shares were up the equivalent of 11 cents at $ 12.96 on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Stock Exchange Thursday morning. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION>, an investors group led by the Anglo-French financier Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, offered $ 13.87 worth of securitie for each BAT share. BAT said it regretted <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>'s decision. The British conglomerate, comprising holdings in tobacco, paper, retailing and financial services, said a referral to the monopolies commission `` would've provided an opportunity for the government to establish a coherent policy on the controversial question of highly leveraged bids for major companies using junk bonds, with their negative potential for the markets, for companies and for small shareholders.'' BAT Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said `` seeing off'' <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> remained the company's first priority. `` We are continuing our strategic review in light of the historic undervaluation of our shares,'' he noted, adding that the company was determined to `` take suitable measures to provide a sustainable long-term increase'' in shareholder value. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> had requested that the takeover panel grant it a lengthier bid timetable because of the need to secure approval from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> state insurance commissioners for a change in ownership of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. BAT last week appealed the takeover panel's decision allowing <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> to renew its offer for BAT within 21 days of overcoming its regulatory obstacles in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Normally in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, a bidder is given 90 days to win a majority stake in its target. If the bidder fails, he must wait at least a year before bidding again.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> is being fined $ 630,000 for alleged security breaches mainly involving its flight that blew up over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, but federal aviation officials say the violations did not lead to the bombing. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> announced the fines involving the Dec. 21 flight on Wednesday, giving the airline 30 days to pay or appeal. The action came as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, prompted by the Pan Am bombing and another apparent airliner bombing over <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on Tuesday, passed a bill to bolster international aviation security. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> fine covers charges of improper screening of passengers and cargo boarding Flight 103 at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airports, as well as five other European flights within a few days after the bombing. The agency said its letter announcing the fines to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> `` contained no allegations that any of the violations contributed to the Flight 103 tragedy.'' All 259 people aboard the flight were killed, as well as 11 on the ground in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said all of the problems cited in the accusations have been corrected. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> called the alleged security lapses `` administrative rather than substantive'' and also said they did not contribute to the bombing. `` There is no evidence that any of the items noted in the ... inspection by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> were in any way related to the bombing of our aircraft last December,'' said <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON>. Investigators are still trying to determine who planted plastic explosives in a radio-cassette player found in debris from the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747's cargo hold. The fines came as a team of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators was setting out for <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to look into the crash of a DC-10 en route from <LOCATION> N'Djamena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The French airline <ORGANIZATION> UTA </ORGANIZATION> said a bomb apparently downed its plane carrying 170 people. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 victims' relatives, <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON>, reacted to the fines by saying the government, not airlines, should be responsible for aviation security. The relatives have called for a federal investigation into the bombing. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., praised the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> action, saying the fines would `` serve notice not only on <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> but all other airlines that we are going to be insistent on not only proper maintenance of the aircraft but proper screening of passengers and baggage that goes on airplanes today. The House on Wednesday passed a bill that would have the government pay $ 270 million for modern weapons-detection equipment at many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and foreign airports. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has ordered airliners to install and pay for the devices. The legislation, approved 392-31, also would require for the first time that commuter airlines screen passengers and luggage, require airlines to acknowledge that they have received <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> warnings of possible security threats, and urge agreements with other countries to require detectable chemicals in plastic explosives. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> accused <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> of failing to properly check 31 passengers at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport and another five at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, where the flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> originated. Other violations were cited in the handling of passengers or cargo for three other flights from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and two from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> within three days after the bombing of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet. In some cases in which passengers were identified for further checks, hand-held metal detectors were used on their carry-on luggage rather than having it opened for physical inspection as required, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said in May that all passengers and cargo boarding Flight 103 were thoroughly inspected. The airline said the allegations of security lapses `` appear to be based on a misunderstanding of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s procedures.'' A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer who handles aviation cases, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stengel </PERSON>, said that despite the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to connect the lapses with the bombing, the fine might still be used by plaintiffs as evidence in support of suits against <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>. He said it could support allegations that <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> was not meeting all of its security responsibilities at the time of the incident. Another aviation lawyer, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerrard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said he thought the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> fines would be excluded as prejudicial evidence in liability cases since the government has not concluded that the violations contributed to the bombing.

 A congressional subcommittee investigating the generic drug industry has asked <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to hand over several documents within two weeks. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>., sent a letter Tuesday to <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> in which he said an inspection report by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> made public last week `` confirmed that callous and cavalier business practices were commonplace in your <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> plant. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> chairs the subcommittee on oversight and investigations of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, which has been investigating production problems and illegal payments in the generic drug industry and the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s approval process for generic drugs. Generic drugs are copies of brand name products that have lost their patent protection. The subcommittee's request seeks from <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> copies of documents dating back to Jan. 1, 1985, and covering <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> responses to any inspections of its manufacturing operations; communication to or from the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> regarding inspections of manufacturing or research facilities for drugs produced or sold in this country; and a list of management personnel at the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> plant. A spokesman for <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> said the company had not received the letter. The 90-page <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> inspection report addressing <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON>'s tablet and capsule manufacturing facility criticized the company's quality control, manufacturing and record-keeping procedures. In response, <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> recalled 18 lots of 10 products, temporarily halted all shipments from the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> plant, and formed an in-house task force to revamp procedures to meet <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> objections. Last week <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s subcommittee asked the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> for the reports of all <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> manufacturing plant inspections worldwide since Jan. 1, 1985.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy grew at a healthy annual rate of 2.5 percent from April through June, slightly slower than previously believed, the government said today. In its final look at overall economic activity in the spring, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said growth in the gross national product was 0.2 percentage point lower than it estimated a month ago The small downward revision did nothing to change the view that the economy was performing remarkably well during the spring, bolstered by a rebound in consumer spending, strong business investment and continued double-digit growth in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. Many economists believe that growth will slow during the second half of the year. However, the momentum provided by the second quarter has erased fears that the country was in danger of toppling into a recession. The GNP revision also bore good news for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s goal of restraining inflation. A price index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 5 percent from April through June, a bit lower than the estimate a month ago. The overall growth rate of 2.5 percent represented a modest downward revision from a 2.7 percent rate estimated a month ago. However, both estimates were well above the inital government projection, which had put GNP growth at an anemic 1.7 percent rate in the second quarter. Before the first GNP estimate was revised, there was widespread concern that a year-long effort by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to dampen inflationary pressures was going to push the country into a recession. The GNP is the nation's total output of goods and services and its braodest measure of economic health. In a companion report, the government said after-tax profits of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations fell 7.2 percent in the second quarter, an even bigger drop than the 5.4 percent drop in after-tax profit estimated a month ago. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> reported on Wednesday the economy started the second half of the year with its growth mixed, ranging from slow to modest from region to region. Other recent government reports also indicate more sluggish growth in the months ahead. `` I basically see us muddling along'' without falling into a recession, said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON>, chief financial eocnomist for <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` There'll be a little weakness here, a little there, but nothing really to collapse us one way or the other,'' he said. Nevertheless, the peacetime record of economic expansion appears likely to reach its seventh year in November. On an annual basis, the economy grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate during the first six months of the year. The administration is predicting GNP growth of 2.9 percent for all of 1989. In contrast to past overly optimistic economic forecasts by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outlook is generally viewed as well within grasp. Indeed, the GNP will only need to expand at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the second half to reach that goal. The reasons for the modest revision in the second quarter GNP were slightly smaller levels of government and consumer spending than estimated a month But even with the revisions, consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity, rose at a solid annual rate of 1.9 percent. Other areas of strength came from a big 8.6 percent increase in business spending on investment and a 13.1 percent rise in American exports, the third consecutive quarter in which exports have climbed at a doublel-digit rate. The various changes left the GNP expanding in the second quarter at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 4.13 trillion. In its report Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said inflation continued to ease over much of the nation as the third quarter got undeway, indicating the central bank continues to attain its goal of easing inflationary pressures without slowing the economy so much that it is driven into a recession. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that consumer inflation was running at a 4.8 percent annual rate, compared to 4.4 percent for all of last year. Most of the newfound strength in the August GNP revision came in consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of total economic activity. Government spending, business investment and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export sales also provided momentum during the spring. But during the summer, consumer spending tapered off except for automobiles. Analysts believe auto sales, which had been driven by incentives and fears of steep increases in 1990-model prices, will slacken in coming months. Exports, which also grew strongly during the first half of 1988, are expected to slow because the rising value of the dollar is making <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods more expensive overseas. `` Capital spending, after being a shining star during the first half of the year, should ease back a bit,'' <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON> said. `` In terms of government spending, it's likely to chug along. The housing market should show a bit more life down the road, but not a lot.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is discussing the sale of its computer reservation system to a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> unit in a deal that could bring the troubled airline concern as much as $ 400 million, according to a report published today. Unidentified sources cited in the Wall Street Journal confirmed that negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> were advanced and that barring a snag, an agreement could be forged within several weeks. A spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> was said to be unavailable for immediate comment on the Journal report while in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> EDS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Still </PERSON> said the company does not comment on speculation. Analysts estimated that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s System One, the third-ranked computer reservation system in the airline industry, could fetch between $ 300 million and $ 400 million. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> has given no indication of what it might do with the proceeds from any sale. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> is facing considerable difficulties. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, its chairman, last month said he may sell an interest in <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s main operating unit. And its <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> unit is in bankruptcy proceedings. The Journal noted that the airline industry's computer reservation system is undergoing its own restructuring. Earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> disclosed it was discussing merging its reservation system with PARS, an operation jointly owned by <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>.

The paper also noted that a System One-EDS combination would mark the first non-airline owner of a computer reservation system. System One has a market share of about 19 percent, according to the Journal, roughly half that of <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sabre </ORGANIZATION> system. In addition to the work it performs for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, EDS is involved in health insurance, government and financial institution data processing.

<HEAD>Plans to Trim Excess Cigarette Inventories</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> WINSTON-SALEM </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> today announced a plan to cut excess customer-held inventories by the end of 1989 by reducing domestic cigarette shipments for the rest of the year. The company also will refocus its distribution incentive programs. `` In the future, <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> will better balance its sales to direct customers with consumer purchases of its products,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, the company's chairman and chief executive officer. `` We will replace our existing trade incentive programs with a comprehensive new program that will provide performance-based financial incentives to our direct customers and assist us in improving our retail share of the market,'' he said in a news release. Details of the new program, which will become effective Jan. 1, 1990, will be announced to customers in December. The program is intended to prevent imbalances in what are known as trade inventories. A company spokeswoman, <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Annese </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION>'s trade inventories are unsold cigarettes held by customers During certain periods of the year, the company offers incentives to customers to encourage them to buy more cigarettes than they expect to sell. The practice is a commonly used method in the consumer goods industry to move products into retail channels. Because tobacco industry unit volume is generally reported based on manufacturer's shipments rather than on actual consumer sales, the plan will result in a reduction from comparable periods in 1988 of <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION>'s reported shipment volume of about 29 percent for the third quarter and 17 percent for the fourth quarter. However, the plan will not have an impact on the company's share of actual consumer shares, which is expected to decline only slightly in 1989. The plan is expected to reduce operating earnings for <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> by about $ 170 million in the third and the same amount in the fourth quarter. However, it is also expected to have a moderate positive impact on the company's cash flow for 1989. <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> expects the plan to have a positive impact on its financial performance after 1989 because of reduced costs for returned product and increased manufacturing and sales efficiency. `` This is a milestone decision that eliminates a long-standing problem for our company in a short time,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. `` It will ensure fresher, more consistent products for our customers, provide more efficiency in our planning, production and distribution and help us build a stronger partnership with our direct customers. We are also pleased that we can accomplish our plan without any reduction in staffing,'' he added. <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s major brands are <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, Camel, Vantage, <ORGANIZATION> Doral </ORGANIZATION>, More, NOW, Century and <PERSON> Ritz </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economists say rising incomes and a decline in the attrition rate are reasons the farm situation is looking up these days. Recent surveys show farm bankruptcy filings in 1988 were down 50 percent from 1986, the peak year for the decade, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday in a preliminary report `` Despite the 1980s farm financial crisis, farm numbers fell less than in preceding decades,'' the report said. `` Farm numbers declined by 266,600 during 1980-89, compared with 1.7 million in the 1950s, 1 million in the 1960s, and 516,000 in the 1970s.'' The brief analysis is in a summary of the October issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine to be issued later this month. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Gajewski </PERSON>, the magazine's economics editor, said the summary's account do not portray fully, however, the impact of the decline in farm numbers during the 1980s. `` There were proportionately more of the large, commercial farms that went out of business in the'80s than in the earlier decades,'' <PERSON> Gajewski </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. But the peak of financial stress for farmers, collectively, has passed, he said. There are still exceptions, including many who are having problems repaying loans made by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Others with debts to commercial banks and the Farm Credit System are faring much better than they were a few years ago. <PERSON> Gajewski </PERSON> cited a recent <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> survey of commercial agricultural banks which showed that 2.8 percent of their farm borrowers went out of business during the year that ended last June 30. Fifty percent of those quitting business did so because of `` normal attrition'' such as retirement and death, he said. In 1986, 6.2 percent of the farms served by the agricultural banks went out of business. And only 29 percent of those were due to normal attrition. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report said 1989 `` net cash income'' of farmers is still expected to decline 5 percent to 13 percent from last year's record of $ 59.9 billion. That was unchanged from the forecast a month ago. Higher expenses associated with larger crop plantings are major factors in the expected decline in cash income this year. Also, federal payments to farmers will be lower. Net cash income is the amount of gross cash income generated by farmers during the calendar year minus cash operating expenses. It includes the sales of inventory stocks build up over previous years. Last year's drought helped push up 1988 net cash income as farmers sold accumulated inventories at higher prices. Another measure used by the agency is `` net farm income'' accounting, which measures the value of the current year's production plus government payments, minus total costs Allowances also are made for the value of family dwellings and other factors. By this method, net farm income could rise 5 percent to 16 percent this year to a range of $ 48 billion to $ 53 billion from $ 45.7 billion in 1988, also unchanged from the August forecast.

 Farmers are idling 29.9 million acres under this year's federal crop programs, little more than half the 54.2 million acres taken from production in 1988, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The final 1989 contract figures were released Wednesday by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The final land-idling figure was up slightly from 29.2 million acres announced in a preliminary report on May 24. To be eligible for price supports and related benefits, farmers who produce feed grains, wheat, cotton and rice are required to take a percentage of their base acres from crop production and put the land in conservation uses that help protect the soil. After drought reduced 1988 production, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> relaxed some of the idling requirements in order to boost plantings for this year's harvest Total land idled, or diverted, under the 1989 programs included: corn, 10.1 million acres; sorghum 2.9 million; barley, 2.2 million; oats, 300,000; wheat, 9.7 million; cotton, 3.5 million; and rice, 1.2 million. The agency report said farmers enrolled 171.2 million acres of land used to produce feed grains, wheat, cotton and rice in the 1989 program, which represented 77.8 percent of the 220 million acres in the national base area for those crops. The idled acres are part of the 171.2 million acres that were enrolled.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Gain on Frost Fears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Forecasts for freezing temperatures this weekend in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> gave grain and soybean futures a boost in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Some forecasters expect frost in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Saturday night, with the cold moving into the eastern Corn Belt Sunday night. If frost occurs, it would be about a week ahead of normal. Analysts said the greatest threat would be to soybeans in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where crops were planted late due to heavy spring rains. In the western Corn Belt, where the crops are more mature, `` I do n't think you're talking about yield losses, I think you're talking about quality problems,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> Frost could slow the natural drying of mature corn and lock some chlorophyll into not-quite-ripe soybeans, causing some discoloration, <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> said. In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 3.91 -LCB- a bushel; corn futures were -LCB- cent to 1 cent higher with December at $ 2.29 -LCB- a bushel; oat futures were unchanged to 1 cent higher with December at $ 1.40 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 -RCB- cents to 5 -LCB- cents higher with November at $ 5.78 a bushel. Livestock futures were mostly higher while pork-belly futures were mostly lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after bellies soared the 2-cents-a-pound daily limit on Wednesday. Live cattle futures were .05 cent to .40 cent higher with October at 71.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .40 cent higher with September at 83.30 cents a pound; hogs were .45 cent lower to .35 cent higher with October at 42.12 cents a pound; frozies were .75 cent lower to 1.40 cents higher with February at 49 cents a pound. Cattle futures retreated Wednesday while pork futures advanced.

 American and Japanese entrepreneurs are making deals in the desolate <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, best known to outsiders as the area where border gunners shot down a <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet. Most foreign investment in the resource-rich, lightly populated region is still in the startup stage. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> sees foreign trade and foreign investment as ways to boost the Soviet economy, although so far no large-scale foreign projects have been started in the Soviet sector of the booming <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>. Nonetheless, enthusiasm abounds on both sides when the ideas mesh, and a small projects are envisioned for ventures ranging from sportfishing to seafood canning to volcano tours. `` The key factor is the -LRB- Soviet -RRB- desire to do business, and it's there in spades,'' W.K <PERSON> Nichoson </PERSON> said after signing a preliminary pact to go into business with the district government in <LOCATION> Yuzhno </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sakhalinsk </LOCATION>, capital of the island of <LOCATION> Sakhalin </LOCATION> and the remote <LOCATION> Kuril </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nichoson </PERSON>, originally from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, but a longtime resident of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, accompanied a group of Tokyo-based journalists on a recent Soviet-arranged tour to <LOCATION> Sakhalin </LOCATION>, previously off limits to foreigners. <PERSON> Sakhalin </PERSON> became a household name worldwide six years ago, when the Soviets shot down a KAL 747 en route from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. All 269 people aboard died in an incident that aggravated East-West tensions. <LOCATION> Sakhalin </LOCATION> also was an area <PERSON> Nichosen </PERSON> knew 35 years ago. Then he was an electronics officer in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> flying reconnaissance missions from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and dodging Soviet fighters based on <LOCATION> Sakhalin </LOCATION>, he said. He has been in business in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> since leaving the military, and started his own company, <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -LRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -RRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, in 1969. `` I've been selling things in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for 30 years, and I'm tired of selling things in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Nichoson </PERSON>, 58, explaining why he was exploring this new frontier. The initial business Nichosen foresees is small _ processing local wild berries for a health drink and canning high-quality seafood, both for export. He is pledging $ 500,000 to be half the capital of a joint-stock company, with local Soviet government enterprises putting up the rest in rubles. But further down the line, he said, there were possibilities in tourism, plywood, dairy products and other exportable goods, and the venture would need `` very large sums from Wall Street investment bankers.'' The Soviet Far East is terra incognita now to Wall Street, but since President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> put the region on the perestroika course of economic restructuring, business tours have been trickling through. Problems abound: the ruble is n't convertible to foreign currency; it is hard to repatriate profits; roads, telephones and hotels are poor; Soviet products often do n't meet export standards. Worst of all, the Soviets are new to business. But the Soviet Far East has such rich resources _ fish, forests, minerals, oil, coal _ that a growing number of foriegn businessmen are exploring for profitable opportunities. Some Japanese firms have embarked on deals, even though <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> does not want economic relations to expand before the resolution of the dispute over Kuril islands captured by Soviet troops in the last days of World War II. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> insists on the return of the islands, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> refuses, and the issue lies like a tall barricade between big Japanese investors and the Soviet desire to join the economic boom now enjoyed by many countries in the Far East. Nonetheless, small Japanese-Soviet operations include two fish-farming joint ventures on <LOCATION> Sakhalin </LOCATION>, the southern half of which was owned by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> until 1945. A Japanese company is taking a 30 percent interest in a project to refurbish a hotel in <LOCATION> Yuzhno </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sakhalinsk </LOCATION> and participate in management. <PERSON> Yoichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Okada </PERSON> is running a <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> restaurant as a joint venture with a Soviet enterprise in the <LOCATION> Sakhalin </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Holmsk </LOCATION> and says it's already profitable. The <LOCATION> Kuchiro </LOCATION> restaurant, in a nicely trimmed building with a giant red lantern outside, stands out in drab Holmsk like a peacock in a piggery. It draws 300 customers a day, <PERSON> Okada </PERSON> said. A problem, he said, is how to take out his side's 49 percent of the profits and convert them to Japanese yen. `` There are ways to do it, maybe buy fish or go into further enterprises to export fish to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Okada </PERSON> said. Perestroika seems to have unleashed a torrent of `` new Soviet businessmen'' on <LOCATION> Sakhalin </LOCATION> with sometimes eccentric ideas requiring foreign money, ties or technology. A geologist wanted to organize tours of the island's volcanoes. An electronics specialist wanted to deal in computer technology. <PERSON> Ilya </PERSON> <PERSON> Sukharev </PERSON>, a local television producer, is organizing a cooperative to export art. He said permission came in only three months. `` I never imagined it could be done in such a short time,'' he said. `` It was a miracle.'' Two <LOCATION> Sakhalin </LOCATION> journalists, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardunov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Grigory </PERSON> <PERSON> Kireev </PERSON>, said their young company is embarking on a deal to develop a resort on an island in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and wants foreign expertise. One way to exploit the area's bountiful fish is with rod and reel, preferrably wielded by a hard-currency-spending foreign anglers. To find out how to please them, the Soviets invited Fishing The West, of <LOCATION> Milwaukie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Sakhalin </LOCATION> to try the rivers and give advice. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of the company said the salmon fishing had been great, but accommodations and roads were poor. `` The Russians want to do it right, but they've got a long way to go,'' he said. End adv for Monday Sept. 25

 The stock market gained ground today with a lift from fresh evidence of a slowing economy. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.93 to 2,692.82 by noontime today on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 7 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 657 up, 509 down and 619 unchanged. Before the trading day began the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the nation's gross national product grew at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, after adjustment for inflation, in the second quarter of the year. That came as a mild surprise to analysts, who had generally been expecting no change in the GNP reading from the 2.7 percent estimated increase the department reported last month. The resulting suggestion of a slower-than-expected pace of business activity prompted a slight decline in open-market interest rates. And brokers said that, in turn, provided a measure of support for stock prices. Chase <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> climbed | to 40 -LRB- in active trading. Wall Streeters generally upgraded their appraisals of the company's earnings outlook following its announcement late Wednesday of large writeoffs on its loans to lesser-developed nations Other money-center bank stocks also rose on the news. <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> added 1 -LRB- to 32 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to 40; <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> 1 to 39 \, and <ORGANIZATION> Bankamerica </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to 33 Telerate jumped 5 \ to 20 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> proposed to acquire the approximately one-third of <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> it does n't already own for $ 18 a share.

 <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it will not give <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> more power just because he is increasing his stake in the Japanese auto parts supplier to 26 percent. But the company, which <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> has railed against for repeatedly refusing him a spot on its board, said the larger ownership by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> takeover specialist could threaten its position on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that his <ORGANIZATION> Boone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder _ was buying another 10 million shares above the 32.4 million it currently holds but has no plans to mount a takeover battle He said he expected to request a special <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> shareholders' meeting in early October `` We just do n't have to allow <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> to have seats on our board even though he increases the stake from 20.2 percent to 26 percent,'' <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mikio </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsuruta </PERSON> said. `` There is no such law.'' <PERSON> Tsuruta </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> could not request a shareholders meeting until at least the end of September. To make such a call, a shareholder must hold more than a 3 percent stake for at least six months. `` We have n't even been notified anything about this from <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' side,'' he said `` The deal is strictly between <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Azabu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which has nothing to do with us in the first place.'' <PERSON> Azabu </PERSON>, a large Japanese car sales and real estate concern, owns about 10 percent of the shares in <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION>, an automobile lighting company closely associated with <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Additional purchases by <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> could endanger <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION>'s position on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s first section, which permits stock dealing on a credit basis and makes raising capital easier `` How come <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> has to do this to us? It would n't be good for any of our shareholders, even including <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Tsuruta </PERSON> said about about the danger of falling to the exchange's second section. A dealer for <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' increased stake could pressure <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> into a compromise allowing <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> to name executives to play a leading role in <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> management. <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> would fall from the first section if its top 10 shareholders' total stake exceeds 80 percent. The top group, including <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> at 20.2 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> at 19 percent, now holds a total 67 percent stake. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' new purchases would boost the level to 73 percent. In addition, a company is supposed to have at least 3,400 shareholders to qualify for the first section, while <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> now has 3,120, <PERSON> Tsuruta </PERSON> said, who charged that a stake increase by <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> would scare off other potential shareholders. Noting that <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> has three representatives on <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION>'s board, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said he and <ORGANIZATION> Boone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have been `` denied our rights because we are Americans.'' `` Not only do they want to keep out Americans from participating in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy, but they also do n't want the Japanese public to see how their closed corporate structure benefits a few elites to the detriment of the public,'' he said Wednesday.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar finished higher against all major <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies in cautious trading Thursday. Gold prices were little changed. Foreign exchange dealers said trading remained in a narrow range with players unwilling to take aggressive positions ahead of this weekend's meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> finance ministers and central bankers. Traders said they were n't expecting any new initiatives out of the weekend meeting, but they were being cautious in case there was a communique expressing concern over an excessive rise in the dollar. Recent statements by Japanese and West German officials indicated some concern about the dollar's strength. The G-7 nations are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 1.25 yen to a closing 145.00 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at a higher rate of 145.10 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound.

 Fresh evidence of a slowing economy helped propel stock prices to a moderate gain today. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.55 to 2,692.44 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 7 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 733 up, 563 down and 585 unchanged. Before the trading day began the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the nation's gross national product grew at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, after adjustment for inflation, in the second quarter of the year. That came as a mild surprise to analysts, who had generally been expecting no change in the GNP reading from the 2.7 percent estimated increase the department reported last month. The resulting suggestion of a slower-than-expected pace of business activity prompted a slight decline in open-market interest rates.

 Stock prices rallied in thin trading late Thursday to close moderately higher. Prices rose on renewed takeover rumors and a healthy showing on Wall Street, which helped to reassure the nervous market. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, the most closely watched market barometer, closed at 2,380.9, up 11.1 points, or 0.5 percent. The index closed at its session high, rebounding from its low of 2,365.4, which it hit during a brief bout of profit-taking in the morning. Volume was a light 413.8 million shares, down from 513.1 million shares Wednesday. `` The market is still very nervous and volatile,'' a dealer with a large British brokerage said. `` This little bit of takeover talk drew some buying in. But volume is still very thin.''

<HEAD>Hoylake Gets British Government Clearance For BAT Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> won an important second round in its takeover battle for <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> Thursday when the British government cleared the group's $ 21 billion hostile bid for the conglomerate. Trade Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> said he would not refer <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION>'s offer to the <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, upholding the Conservative government's free-market policies and sweeping aside concerns about the advent of giant, highly leveraged, junk bond-financed buyouts in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> However, <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> said, the matter could be reconsidered if there were a material change in the terms of the bid for BAT or other `` material facts.'' The decision followed last week's ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> Panel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Takeovers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> giving <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> _ which is led by financier Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> _ more time for its bid. The offer has been delayed by regulatory hurdles in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. BAT stock rose 22 cents to close at $ 13.07 a share Thursday on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> is offering $ 13.87 in securities for each BAT share. BAT noted <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>'s decision `` with regret,'' but said it was pleased the trade secretary left open the possibility of referring the bid to the mergers commission if its terms were changed. BAT said a referral to the monopolies commission would have given the British government a chance to establish a policy on takeovers that rely heavily on risky junk bonds. Junk bonds have a `` negative potential for the markets, for companies and for small shareholders,'' BAT said. Securities analysts have said <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> would have to raise its offer and include cash to succeed. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> wants to retain BAT's tobacco interests and sell its retailing, financial services and paper and packaging operations. BAT Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said his company would try to defeat the <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> bid on its merits. He said BAT was determined to `` take suitable measures to provide a sustainable long-term increase'' in shareholder value. Because <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> was formed by <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> merchant banker <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> and Australian entrepreneur <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> specifically to make the BAT bid, it was unlikely the offer would be referred to the monopolies commission on competition grounds, a common basis for review. The bid's opponents have argued for an investigation into whether the offer is in the public interest, contending that such highly-leveraged takeovers could strap British companies with debt, cut down on their investments and distract executives from day-to-day management. <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> said he based his decision on a recommendation by Director General of Trading Sir <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Borrie </PERSON>, who advised there were no competitive problems raised by the buyout offer. `` In the first instance it must be for the shareholders to decide,'' <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio. `` I would not wish to interfere in a purely market situation.'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, an opposition Labor lawmaker who serves as his party's spokesman on trade matters, said, `` This is a triumph of narrow ideology over the wider interests of British industry.'' <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> requested that the takeover panel grant it a lengthier bid timetable because of the need to secure approval from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> state insurance commissioners for a change in ownership of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Insurance regulators in nine states have undertaken reviews of the deal. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> wants to sell Farmers to the French insurance company <ORGANIZATION> Axa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurances </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s group is hoping the move will speed up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approval for their bid. BAT immediately appealed the takeover panel's decision allowing <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> to renew its offer for BAT within 21 days of overcoming its regulatory obstacles in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Normally in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, a bidder is given 90 days to win a majority stake in its target. If the bidder fails, it must wait at least a year before bidding again.

<HEAD>OPEC Ministers Will Hold Meeting on Contentious Quota Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers will meet this weekend to tackle the troublesome issue of how to fairly divvy up oil-production shares among the 13 nations. Some want much more than their current allotment. But analysts were skeptical the eight-member committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> would do much more than review proposals for reworking output quotas assigned each member. <PERSON> Fergus </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON>, analyst at the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wedd </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said he expected `` not very much'' to come out of the meeting that begins Saturday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Failure to reach any meaningful conclusion on current production, however, could be `` very dangerous'' because countries might widen their oil taps and increase their already high production level, he said. Another analyst, <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Antill </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NatWest </ORGANIZATION>, predicted the ministers would `` leave the fighting until November'' when all 13 ministers are scheduled to gather for a key year-end meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. `` They will discuss -LRB- quotas -RRB- but they will take no decision,'' said <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Terzian </PERSON>, editor of the oil publication Petrostrategies in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The ministers are at odds over how the cartel divides up and sets the ceilings for each country's crude output. Some countries, like <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, want a larger share of the production pie. Both have been ignoring their quotas in recent months and pumping at higher levels. Moreover, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> just opened the second phase of a twin pipeline across <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, which will add more than a million barrels a day to its export capacity. The move increases the likelihood it will want a higher quota. Analysts estimate <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s current production at close to 22 million barrels a day, well over the cap of 19.5 million set in June for the last six months of the year. Prices have been lower than earlier in the year. A basket of seven crudes monitored by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> was priced at $ 17.04 a barrel last week, under the cartel's target of $ 18. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil, has been trading in the range of $ 19.50 to $ 20 for a 42-gallon barrel. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude normally sells for about $ 2 above the OPEC-monitored crudes. Indonesian Oil Minister <PERSON> Ginandjar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kartasasmita </PERSON> was quoted earlier this month as saying he was not satisfied with the market's recent performance. `` We have not been able to reach the $ 18 per barrel price level that we wanted, except for a few weeks earlier this summer,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> OPECNA </ORGANIZATION>, the cartel's news agency. At their June conference, the ministers agreed to begin the tough task of finding a more acceptable way to figure out each country's take of the cartel's daily output But analysts detected less willingness now _ with higher production and weaker prices _ to try to solve the problem. Nevertheless, they expected <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> to put forth proposals for drawing up quotas that would consider only oil-related factors. Some members have suggested that quotas take into account a country's `` need'' for oil revenue as determined by its foreign debt, balance of payments and population. While quotas were likely to grab most of the attention, the ministers were also expected to decide whether to boost their supply cap to 20 million barrels a day in the last quarter. An <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> official, who demanded anonymity, said there was `` a slight possibility'' they would do so. `` They may want to narrow the gap between the quota and actual production,'' said <PERSON> Bahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Karbassioun </PERSON>, an oil consultant in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. But he said production `` could go even higher'' if countries failed to agree to abide by their ceilings. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Monthly Oil Market Report that the nations lifted output in August to 21.6 million barrels a day, the highest so far this year. The agency is an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, made up of two-dozen Western nations. The eight-member Long-term Strategy and Price-Monitoring Committee includes ministers from <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. The other five nations _ <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> _ were also invited to attend. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s oil chief, <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON>, was reported recovering from surgery earlier this month in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and was not expected to attend.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ferranti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it plans to sell $ 158 million in assets to reduce its debt and that it had reached agreement with its creditor banks on a support program. The program is to help <PERSON> Ferranti </PERSON> weather any financial difficulties resulting from losses related to irregularities it recently discovered in its accounts. <PERSON> Ferranti </PERSON>'s discovery of possible contract fraud by its <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, Pa.-based subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> led the company to seek assurances from its banks they would hold open lines of credit. <ORGANIZATION> Ferranti </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Alun-Jones </PERSON> announced the latest developments in a Thursday letter to employees, a copy of which was obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> AP-Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. It said the company `` has now reached agreement with its bankers by which credit facilities for the company are in place to take it forward.'' The letter did n't elaborate on the extent of the credit. It said <PERSON> Ferranti </PERSON> was in talks with parties for the sale of about $ 158 million, or 100 million British pounds, of `` peripheral'' assets. <PERSON> Alun-Jones </PERSON> said Monday that an investigation of contract irregularities at <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> suggested that <PERSON> Ferranti </PERSON> was `` at least misled and possibly made the victim of serious fraud.'' But he said these problems affected only a few transactions and were not connected with other important contracts. The <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> reported that the company might have to write off $ 237 million or more against non-existent contracts for which the company had previously believed it had been paid.

 The dollar gained ground against the major currencies in quiet dealings Thursday. Gold prices were unchanged to slightly higher. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, a troy ounce of gold finished at $ 365.50, up 60 cents from Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> later quoted a bid of $ 363.85 for a troy ounce of gold, up 25 cents from late Wednesday. Currency traders continued to square up their positions ahead of this weekend's meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> finance ministers and central bankers. The <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> includes representatives from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Although dealers were divided over whether any new initiatives would result from the meeting, the underlying sentiment toward the dollar remained bullish. With the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> openly intervening throughout the week to drive the dollar lower, `` one would believe that something will happen -LRB- to push the dollar down -RRB-, but we're seeing a continued demand for dollars,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Recent statements by Japanese and West German officials indicated some concern about the dollar's strength. But at regularly scheduled meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> officials Thursday failed to result in an expected hike in West German interest rates. Some traders are anticipating higher West German and Japanese interest rates in tandem with softer rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a scenario that would depress the dollar. `` That would take away the interest-rate differential, which is sustaining the demand for dollars,'' <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> said. Separately, the dollar failed to respond to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s downward revision in the second-quarter gross national product. The government pegged economic growth at a moderate 2.5 percent during the April-June period. `` The technicals are bearish, and you would think the momentum would be on the downside,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` But it looks like we're having real difficulty getting the dollar lower. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 1.25 yen to a closing 145.00 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at a higher rate of 145.10 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 145.65 yen, up from 145.10 yen on Wednesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.5805 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.5820 late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, one pound cost $ 1.5790, less expensive than Wednesday's $ 1.5835 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday, included: 1.9846 West German marks, up from 1.9397; 1.6835 Swiss francs, up from 1.6815; 6.5740 French francs, up from 6.5560; 1,400.25 Italian lire, up from 1,399.00, and 1.1830 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1833. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday, included: 1.9435 West German marks, up from 1.9400; 1.6830 Swiss francs, up from 1.6800; 6.5710 French francs, up from 6.5585; 2.1920 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1890; 1,401.00 Italian lire, up from 1,399.50; 1.1842 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1824. Gold held steady in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a late bid price of $ 363.25 a troy ounce, unchanged from Wednesday's late bid. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold also was unchanged at a bid $ 363.50. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 2.69 to close at a bid $ 364.11.

 The stock market posted a small loss for the second straight session Thursday, yielding to some late selling by professional traders. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed with a 3.61 loss at 2,680.28. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 677 up, 750 down and 536 unchanged. Before the trading day began the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the nation's gross national product grew at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, after adjustment for inflation, in the second quarter of the year. That came as a mild surprise to analysts, who had generally been expecting no change in the GNP reading from the 2.7 percent estimated increase the department reported last month. The resulting suggestion of a slower-than-expected pace of business activity helped stocks gain ground in early trading. But after the advance faltered near the 2,700 level in the Dow Jones industrial average, prices began to retreat. Brokers said much of the late pressure on the market came from traders engaged in computer-program strategies involving stock index options and futures and the prominent stocks that are components of the indexes. Chase <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> climbed -LCB- to 40 in active trading. Wall Streeters generally upgraded their appraisals of the company's earnings outlook following its announcement late Wednesday of large writeoffs on its loans to lesser-developed nations. <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION>, which late Thursday announced a move similar to <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>'s, rose -LRB- to 39 -RCB-. Among other money-center bank stocks, <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> added -RCB- to 31 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> 1 -LRB- to 39 -RRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Bankamerica </ORGANIZATION> | to 33 -LCB-. Telerate jumped 5 \ to 20 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> proposed to acquire the approximately one-third of <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> it does n't already own for $ 18 a share, and speculation quickly spread that <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> might increase the bid. <ORGANIZATION> Kollmorgen </ORGANIZATION> fell 5 \ to 18 -RRB- after <ORGANIZATION> Vernitron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it no longer wanted to proceed with a $ 25-a-share takeover of the company <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Togs </PERSON>, which cut its quarterly dividend from 15 cents a share to 5 cents a share, dropped ~ to 12 -RRB-. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 146.93 million shares, up from 136.64 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 173.11 million shares. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 3.05 billion, or 0.09 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks dropped .29 to 192.16. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index fell .96 to 394.64, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was down .77 at 345.70 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained .28 to 467.00.

<HEAD>Hit New Record for 12th Straight Week</HEAD>

 Assets of the nation's 466 money market mutual funds rose $ 1.30 billion in the latest week to a new all-time high of $ 348.98 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. It was the 12th straight week that fund assets reached a new record and reflected the growing popularity of money market mutual funds despite a general softening of interest rates. The institute, a Washington-based mutual-fund trade group, also revised upward its week-earlier asset figure to $ 347.68 billion from the $ 347.07 billion first reported, largely because of the addition of three new funds. It said that in the latest week, assets of 230 general purpose funds rose $ 1.13 billion to $ 113.21 billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds increased $ 815.8 million to $ 151.56 billion, and assets of 141 institutional funds declined $ 645.4 million to $ 84.21 billion. The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in the week ended Tuesday to 8.26 percent from 8.27 percent the previous week, said <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s Money Fund Report, a trade journal based in <LOCATION> Holliston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The 30-day average yield fell to 8.26 percent from 8.28 percent, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s said. The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 37 days, up from 36 days, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s said. The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield available on money market accounts unchanged from a week earlier at 6.44 percent. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW accounts, remained unchanged from a week earlier at 5.10 percent. Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.24 percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.25 the previous week. Yields were 8.29 percent on 1-year CDs, down from 8.30 percent; 8.21 percent on 2 -LCB- - year CDs, down from 8.22 percent; and 8.21 percent on 5-year CDs, unchanged

<HEAD>Grain Futures Rally, Bracing for Freeze</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices rallied strongly Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as the markets braced for the first hard freeze of the season in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. On other markets, silver futures were sharply higher for the second consecutive session; energy futures were mixed; and livestock and meat futures were mixed. Wheat futures settled 2 cents to 3 cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 3.94 -RCB- a bushel; corn futures were unchanged to 3 cents higher with December at $ 2.31 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 2 cents higher with December at $ 1.41 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents lower to 7 \ cents higher with November at $ 5.82 -RCB- a bushel The rally was rooted in forecasts for freezing temperatures this weekend and early next week, possibly reaching as far south as northern <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. `` This is record-breaking or near-record-breaking type cold coming in,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Notis </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Freese-Notis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a private forecasting firm in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Most corn and soybean crops west of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> have matured beyond the danger stage. But the crops in other Midwestern states east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> _ especially soybeans _ are susceptible to freeze damage. <PERSON> Notis </PERSON> estimated that 500 million bushels of soybeans, a little less than a quarter of the crop, were still vulnerable to frost damage and that 45 million to 70 million bushels could be hurt by the arctic high pressure system sweeping down from northwestern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Most of that damage is likely to occur in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, he said. In the western Corn Belt, where the crops are more mature, `` I do n't think you're talking about yield losses, I think you're talking about quality problems,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> Frost could slow the natural drying of mature corn and lock some chlorophyll into not-quite-ripe soybeans, causing some discoloration, <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelsen </PERSON>, a meteorologist with <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Trettl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Northfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, predicted a less-severe freeze than <PERSON> Notis </PERSON>. Still, he said, `` I would expect to see a killing frost over a great portion of the upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> by early next week. We've got quite a cold snap here.'' Silver futures scooted up sharply on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the dollar weakened but gold futures made only slight gains, held back by the oil market's lackluster showing. Gold settled 10 cents to 60 cents higher with October at $ 366.30 a troy ounce; silver was 6 cents to 6.4 cents higher with September at $ 5.181 a troy ounce. Crude-oil futures were narrowly mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> but near-month gasoline and heating-oil futures rose sharply amid concerns about potential damage to refineries from Hurricane Hugo. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents lower to 3 cents higher with November at $ 19.62 a barrel; heating oil was .25 cent to 1.03 cents higher with October at 57.58 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .30 cent lower to 2.12 cents higher with October at 61.86 cents a gallon. Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .55 cent higher with October at 71.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .20 cent higher with September at 83.10 cents a pound; hogs were .43 cent lower to .13 cent higher with October at 41.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.10 cents lower to .60 cent higher with February at 48.75 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Money Supply Grew In Latest Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended Sept. 11, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,153.9 billion from $ 3,142.0 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 4,017.8 billion from $ 4,007.3 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 782.1 billion from $ 774.7 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,122.5 billion, a 5.8 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 4,001.5 billion, up 4.4 percent, while M1 fell 1.4 percent to an average of $ 776.1 billion. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported commercial and industrial loans at major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> banks fell $ 6.95 billion, compared with a rise of $ 1.46 billion a week earlier _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> at the discount window, excluding extended credit, averaged $ 723 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from $ 461 million the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said net free reserves averaged $ 487 million in the two weeks ended Sept. 20, up from a revised $ 431 million in the previous two-week period The previous period's average originally was reported as $ 483 million. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 292.8 billion in the two-week period ended Sept. 20 up from $ 289.8 billion two weeks earlier

 <ORGANIZATION> Immunex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday announced a plan that will transform it from a research-dominated firm in medical biotechnology into a conventional pharmaceutical company. The 8-year-old company, based in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said it would achieve the transition primarily by reacquiring rights to sell Immunex-developed products in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In return, its business partners will get rights to some other <ORGANIZATION> Immunex </ORGANIZATION> products, primarily for overseas distribution. <ORGANIZATION> Immunex </ORGANIZATION>'s plan will require the company to build a sales staff from scratch, but it should permit it to keep more of the profits from its work, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Labe </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simpson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Overall, I think it's an aggressive strategy,'' <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> said. In over-the-counter trading Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Immunex </ORGANIZATION> stock fell 50 cents to $ 16.50. <ORGANIZATION> Immunex </ORGANIZATION> uses gene-splicing and other biotechnology techniques to create products for medical treatment, mainly products that either promote or inhibit the activity of the immune system. Products that are being tested on people in government-supervised trials include ones for cancer therapy, wound healing and protection of bone marrow from the harmful effects of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The biggest threat to <ORGANIZATION> Immunex </ORGANIZATION> is that other companies developing products in the same field could challenge its patent position, <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> said. At the end of 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Immunex </ORGANIZATION> had marketing rights for only two of its own products. After the changes announced Thursday, some of which occurred earlier this year, it will have rights to more than a dozen. Like many small biotech companies, <ORGANIZATION> Immunex </ORGANIZATION> had given marketing rights for its products to other companies in exchange for research funding and help in manufacturing. Even after the deals, other companies will retain foreign marketing rights for many Immunex-related products. <ORGANIZATION> Immunex </ORGANIZATION>'s partners include <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Behringwerke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Syntex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> The restructuring will give <ORGANIZATION> Immunex </ORGANIZATION> a five-year head start on its plan to transform itself into a conventional pharmaceutical company by 1995, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Duzan </PERSON>, the chairman and chief executive, said at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> news conference. `` We're going to be a modest-sized but fully integrated pharmaceutical company,'' <PERSON> Duzan </PERSON> said in an interview. <ORGANIZATION> Immunex </ORGANIZATION> said it is poised to enter the cancer market in the coming five years and the infectious disease and autoimmune disease markets in 1995 to 2000. Autoimmune diseases are those such as arthritis and diabetes in which the body is attacked by its own immune-system defenses. <ORGANIZATION> Immunex </ORGANIZATION> reacquired worldwide marketing and manufacturing rights to interleukin-1 receptor and interleukin-4 receptor products by restructuring its joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. It also reacquired <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> co-marketing and manufacturing rights from <ORGANIZATION> Behringwerke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> for CM-CSF -LRB- granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor -RRB-, interleukin-3 and other CSF products. In return, it gave <ORGANIZATION> Behringwerke </ORGANIZATION> the foreign rights to a package of receptor products, including receptors for interleukin-1, interleukin-4 and other undisclosed receptor products. It retained all North American rights for all receptor products. Receptors can block the destructive action of the immune system by serving as decoys for attackers.

 <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> agreed Thursday to pay what could total more than $ 50 million for allegedly bilking hundreds of thousands of Californians with loans later packed with extra requirements. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> called the civil settlement capping a three-year investigation `` one of the largest and most sweeping consumer fraud settlements in American history.'' He said Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> lured applicants into expensive loans packed with extras such as various forms of insurance and thrift club memberships. Applicants were bilked of as much as $ 2,000 each, he said. <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> is the parent company of co-defendants <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ which <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said had no connection with <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lyndon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lyndon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. All the consumers involved are to be sent letters explaining the settlement <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> estimated as many as 300,000 victims but said only about one third are expected to seek restitution, with the total return between $ 25 million and $ 50 million. <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> also will pay $ 10.5 million to establish consumer protection trust funds, $ 8.67 million in civil penalties and $ 575,000 for legal costs and a toll-free phone number for consumers claiming refunds. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> took advantage of people `` in desperate need of money'' and charged up to 35 percent interest on loans and attached items. <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement it agreed to restitution at the same time a civil suit was filed Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> Alameda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. It neither admitted nort denied wrongdoing. <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> said the accusations `` without doubt were contraventions to our procedures and not a pattern of behavior condoned by the company,'' but added that `` pre-existing safeguards'' existed on loans and insurance. Claimants will be entitled to interest paid, interest on the interest for years involved and the cost of all extras.

 <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> moved ahead of other major banking companies Thursday by adding $ 2 billion to its cushion of reserves for loan losses, indicating deeper pessimism about the chances of repayment by developing countries <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s action was far more severe than those taken earlier this week by <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s reserves now equal 100 percent of its medium - and long-term loans to developing In contrast, <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>'s equal 46 percent after its addition this week and Manufacturers Hanover's 36 percent <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said it would continue doing business in developing countries but would focus on merchant banking rather than general lending. Merchant banking involves providing advice, trading and investing and finance. `` We will continue to consider lending in appropriate specific transactions. We intend to continue to play a constructive role in developing countries,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> said. The bigger cushion indicates <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> has gotten tired of prolonged and unfruitful negotiations with debtor nations on repayment, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, a banking analyst at <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think they just want to say the hell with this,'' he said. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, the nation's third-largest bank-holding company, also is one of the financially strongest. That means it was able to take the punishment of the $ 2 billion addition, which will result in a loss of about $ 1.8 billion in the current quarter. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s action could be an indication of trouble for the negotiations on debt relief under a plan devised by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said. Less developed countries have debts of $ 1.3 trillion. `` Early on in this process everybody sort of pulled together, followed the lead of <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said. `` Everybody is sort of cutting and running now and pursuing their own interest.'' This week's round of additions to loan-loss reserves was triggered by the conclusion last week of an accord to provide debt relief to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> under the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan, which emphasizes debt forgiveness by the banks. The terms of the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> accord made banks acknowledge that they had been overly optimistic in their earlier expectations for repayment. But <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s action seemed to go beyond necessity, <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said. `` Economic and political problems have intensified in several countries where we have significant exposure, including problems in paying interest when due,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s chairman, said in a written statement. <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> said he was concerned that debtor countries could be expecting more help from the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan than the industrial countries are likely to provide. He also said: `` Achieving satisfactory loan restructuring agreements will also be more and more difficult because of increasingly divergent approaches to LDC -LRB- less-developed country -RRB- debt problem among bank lenders and among governments.'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> now has a total of $ 3 billion in loan-loss reserves, with $ 2.8 billion of that unofficially allocated to loans to developing countries. That $ 2.8 billion is equal to 70 percent of <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s total loans to developing countries, and 100 percent of the medium-and long-term loans to those nations In an indication of <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s financial strength, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and Standards and Poor's both confirmed their investment-grade ratings on Morgan senior debt. The last big round of additions to reserves was in late 1987, and many banking companies have not taken any action since then. For example, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s loan-loss reserves equal just 28 percent of its loans to developing countries, the level it reached in late 1987, spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Salmans </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it would take a $ 1.31 billion charge in the third quarter, largely to boost its reserves for troubled loans to developing countries. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> also announced plans to raise $ 500 million by selling new common shares. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> said its reserve increase would boost its reserves for losses on loans to developing countries to 46 percent of its $ 6.2 billion in such loans and would produce a third-quarter loss for the holding company of $ 1.11 billion. Manufacturers Hanover on Monday added $ 950 million to its loan-loss reserves and sold control of its asset-based lending unit, <ORGANIZATION> CIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Dai-Ichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kangyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.28 billion. Manufacturers Hanover also agreed to sell a 4.9 percent stake in the parent company to <ORGANIZATION> Dai-Ichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kangyo </ORGANIZATION> for another $ 120 million. Manufacturers Hanover said the addition to its loan-loss reserve would produce a third-quarter loss of $ 775 million.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Incomes rose sharply for people in key <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries last year, with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s increase almost twice that of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the average went up to $ 12,480 from 1987's $ 11,780, while average income in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rose to $ 14,080 from $ 13,650. The figures are corrected for inflation. The data show that compared with wealthier countries, the Third World is losing its share of the world's income, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who heads the bank's office on social and economic data. `` Comparatively, the poor are getting poorer,'' he said. People in countries where earnings are lower showed more modest gains. The average South Korean had a proportionately large increase: from $ 2,760 to $ 3,060 in 1988. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was up from $ 310 to $ 330, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> from $ 620 to $ 680 and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> showed a sharp rise from $ 830 to $ 940. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s figure for 1988 was not in yet. In 1987, the average Chinese had an income of $ 510. No figure was given for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, which is not a member of the bank. `` For 1989, we expect to see a modest correction in what have been very high rates of growth down to more sustainable levels for <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and several middle-income countries,'' said <PERSON> Attila </PERSON> <PERSON> Karaosmanoglu </PERSON>, the bank's vice-president for <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s figures deal largely with <ORGANIZATION> Third </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> countries, since it is the largest source of loans to raise their standards of living. Statistics for 1988 are not yet complete, officials said. Scattered reports for a few European countries that borrow from the bank showed increases in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> from $ 4,810 to $ 5,010 and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> from $ 4,310 to $ 4,440. But in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> there was a drop, to $ 3,080 from $ 3,180 in 1987. In <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the 1988 figure fell to $ 1,800 from $ 1,830. The significant losses came in the larger countries. In <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, which accounts for a third of the production in the continent, average income dropped to $ 1,930 from $ 1,980. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> the fall was to $ 2,260 from $ 2,300 and in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> from $ 3,390 to $ 3,290. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> rose to $ 2,370 from $ 2,280, while <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s figure was not available. For southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the bank's figures show a steady decline since 1980, when the average income for the area was $ 570 a year. In 1988 it was $ 440. The Republic of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is not included in this calculation.

 The total cost of the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> buyout could reach $ 9.45 billion, according to <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filings by the employee-managment group seeking to take over <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' parent. The group, composed of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilots, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s top management and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, also announced in newspaper ads Thursday the commencement of their tender offer for all outstanding shares of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s common stock for $ 300 a share. According to the merger agreement filed with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, the buyout group will require $ 6.8 billion to purchase <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s 22.65 million fully diluted shares. It said the group may refinance $ 950 million in existing <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> debt, which would leave $ 512 million in long-term debt and $ 411 million in capital leases outstanding. Various fees and a $ 1.3 billion credit facility for working capital are also included in the total buyout cost. The buyout, accepted by <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors Sept. 14, will give <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> workers 75 percent ownership of the company. Management will own 10 percent and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> will own 15 percent. The group plans to finance the transaction with $ 750 million from <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, $ 200 million in voluntary pension contributions from the pilots, $ 1.3 billion from <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> cash reserves and $ 7.2 billion in bank loans.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> prefers to sell its goods for Western hard currency but its imports from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, paid for by bartering, are way up, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reports. `` Chinese imports of goods such as timber and fertilizer, where the quality of the Soviet commodity is comparable to that elsewhere, will probably grow this year as <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> turns to barter to conserve foreign exchange,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> said in an analysis prepared for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and released this week to the press. Sino-Soviet trade grew 27 percent least year to a two-way total of $ 3.3 billion and figures for the first half of 1989 show even stronger growth, with Chinese imports surging by 63 percent and exports up 12 percent, the report said. Trade along the Soviet-Chinese border has risen swiftly to account for 10 percent of the two countries' trade, welcomed by remote Chinese provinces lacking easy access to other markets, it noted. The report also disclosed that 8,000 Chinese laborers are working on projects in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under arrangements generally providing payment to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with a percentage of the production. At least 5,000 more are expected to follow, it said.

<TEXT>
 With Thursday's announcement of the state's 113th bank closing this year, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> tied last year's record on a scorecard of failure that experts say may slow, but wo n't end, for several years. `` We believe that 1990 is going to show a slight increase in the number of independently chartered banks that fail,'' said <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Banking Commissioner <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Littlefield </PERSON>. But `` we will continue to have bank failures for two more years that are the result of past lending decisions.'' `` We have seen the peak as far as the absolute numbers are concerned,'' added <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Flannigan </PERSON>, a Houston-based analyst for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> Nationally, the numbers should remain about the same next year, according to <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. The failures will continue, <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> said, `` even though the economy in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and other parts of the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> has begun to stabilize somewhat, because changes in the banking industry always lag from 18 months to 24 months.'' On Thursday, <PERSON> Littlefield </PERSON> shut down <ORGANIZATION> Rose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>. The bank, which had assets of $ 64.6 million and deposits of about $ 61.1 million, was purchased by <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 25,000. <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> also will purchase about $ 46.4 million of Rose Capital's assets. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> will provide $ 16.8 million in assistance, and retain assets with a book value of $ 18.2 million. The 113 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> failures this year included 20 involved in the federal seizure of <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> banks and 24 from the shutdown of banks owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The number does not include the 12 banks of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> that were bought by <ORGANIZATION> Equimark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> in a federally assisted transaction. Last year's 113 included 40 banks taken over from <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Those banks became <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which remains the state's largest bank Nationally, Rose Capital was the 160th failure this year, a huge jump from 10 years ago. Ten banks failed each year from 1979 to 1981 and `` we thought it was Armageddon,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> said. Since then, the numbers have grown each year: 42 in 1982, 48 in 1983, 80 in 1984, 120 in 1985, 138 in 1986, 184 in 1987 and 200 last year. Although regulators frequently cite poor management and inadequate supervision as reasons for specific failures, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rieke </PERSON>, a banking analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Rauscher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pierce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refsnes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said regulators themselves are partially at fault. He said that from 1982 to 1985 `` the regulators just indiscriminately approved bank charters and these banking organizations never had the opportunity to grow in size.'' <PERSON> Rieke </PERSON> predicted it would take five years to clean the slate. <PERSON> Littlefield </PERSON>, who took over as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banking commissioner three years ago, said, `` In hindsight, it's easy to make that conclusion: that there were too many banks chartered.''

 Do takeover battles really end when the power system blows during a climactic board meeting? Probably not. But that was about the only thing clearly out of character Thursday as <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> chairman and investor <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and a cast of corporate and civic heavyweights including the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> put some of their well-honed moves on public display in a three-hour simulated takeover. `` I think it's been incredibly realistic,'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, the dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Fordham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said shortly before the lights dimmed and the microphones went dead. He said the participants in the program that people from his school designed were `` acting as they do at real board meetings.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> who played the role of the chief executive of the company under siege, rated the interplay among the board members `` surprisingly good.'' But <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, the chief executive of the investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, cautioned that there were limits to the imagined reality. `` What we are doing in 10 minutes takes 10 days,'' he said. In the game, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> played an investment banker advising <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who was cast as an investor with a small stake in the beleaguered target company and was considering launching an alternative takeover bid. The program was put on at a conference run by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an international organization of management groups. The simulation went a step further than recent exercises in which prominent people in various fields are brought together for a moderator-led discussion about a hypothetical case. In this corporate war game, the directors of the imaginary <ORGANIZATION> Main </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Southern retailing company, met in one room to mourn the death of their chairman and to assess their options should the swirl of takeover rumors produce an offer. At the same time, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> was closeted in a room across the hall, talking one-by-one with with financial advisers, union officials and representatives of a foundation that had an 18 percent stake in the company about his plans to make a bid for the company. Several hundred people attending the conference were invited to walk back and forth between the rooms as they wished as the scenario unfolded through a series of twists and turns. Conference staffers added to the atmosphere with periodic updates on the company's stock price and news headlines, such as <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s notice that he bought an 8 percent stake in the firm Observers got to watch <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> court the unions and the foundation for support before going to the board. They saw him needle his investment bankers about the fees they wanted to finance the bid and get so swept up in the franctic pace of activity that he chided an inattentive assistant by blurting out, `` Come on, you're not at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>.'' When <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> finally got in to see the board, he found they had been doing their homework as well and felt that neither his offer nor a competing bid was worth accepting. Board members said they would investigate a recapitalization instead. The real-life power outage cut short any additional countermoves, and the game was declared finished. `` I enjoyed it,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> concurred, saying `` It was entertaining. It was fun.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the civil rights activist who played a foundation representative interested in protecting the communities and workers served by the stores, said the game created a `` healthy environment'' for discussion of tough issues. `` I hope it increases all of our sensitivity,'' he said.

<HEAD>Burned Junk Bond Investors Sue Regulators in Lincoln Debacle</HEAD>

 Investors who say they lost $ 250 million on junk bonds sold by <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> sued the state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Thursday, claiming state officials never should have allowed the bond sale. The suit alleges the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporations </ORGANIZATION> disregarded its own findings and warnings by savings and loan regulators when it approved the sale of bonds by <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. It accuses top Department of Corporations officials, including <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, the head of the department, of conflict of interest because of their ties to the law firm representing <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> company that federal officials are suing for $ 1.1 billion. American <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> is operating under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, who once worked for the law firm, declined detailed comment, but said, `` Our actions were appropriate, we think we did more than what was required by the law, and we are persuaded that a court will find in our favor.'' Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotchett </PERSON> added the state as a defendant in an <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> class-action suit filed on behalf of 23,000 bondholders. The suit says many of the investors were elderly people who believed the bonds were insured because they were purchased in Lincoln Savings offices. The suit seeks return of the $ 250 million, unspecified punitive damages and attorneys' fees. <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> is insolvent and has been seized by thrift regulators, with estimated losses to taxpayers running as high as $ 2.5 billion, the largest <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout in history. Federal thrift regulators have sued <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> officials for $ 1.1 billion, with additional penalties that could bring the total to $ 2.4 billion. That suit accuses <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> officials of racketeering, insider trading, illegal loans, sham real-estate and tax transactions, and the fraudulent sale of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> stock to employees of the parent company. The <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> suit, amended Thursday, says state regulators had enough documentation that they knew or should have known that <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> was near collapse in 1986, when the regulators approved the sale of $ 200 million in uninsured junk bonds known as subordinated debentures. Junk bonds are high-risk, high-yield securities usually offered by companies with a great deal of debt on their books or in weak financial condition. In addition, state officials approved the sale of $ 150 million more in American <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> junk bonds in 1988. The suit says the bonds were extremely risky to investors because of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s precarious financial condition, the company's speculative investment portfolio and `` the high probability that the subordinated debentures would be sold to persons seeking to make federally insured deposits, and who would not understand the risks of subordinated debentures.'' When a company goes bankrupt, holders of its junk bonds are among the last creditors to get paid. The head of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, contributed $ 366,250 to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> politicians from 1986 to 1988, including $ 79,000 to Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, most of it for his 1986 re-election bid. At a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporations </ORGANIZATION> meeting on the bond offering in March 1988, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuelian </PERSON>, <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>'s chief fund raiser, personally represented <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. The meeting helped lead to approval of the bond sale. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> once worked for <PERSON> Samuelian </PERSON>'s firm. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Beermann </PERSON> said Thursday that `` Mr. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> was one of 56,000 individuals who contributed to the governor's re-election campaign. Campaign contributions in no way influenced any action by the <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> administration.''

 The chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hathaway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, investor <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON>, said Wednesday he now has federal regulators' permission to vote his stock in <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, as provided by a previous agreement.

In July, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor group headed by Wall Street money manager <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinhardt </PERSON> said it acquired 5.98 percent of <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> and might seek control of the <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, Va.-based airline company. The group said in a recent <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing that it had increased its holding to 8.38 percent through stock purchases between Sept. 7 and Monday.
